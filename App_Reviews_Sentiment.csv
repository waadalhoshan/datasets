I love this app, but I do have one major gripe - I want an option to buy premium once (even at a higher price) and not as a monthly or yearly subscription. Edit - very unhappy with developer response to pricing. I want to buy premium for this great product they made, but it's NOT a service. This isn't Netflix. You're going to turn potential buyers away with this pricing model;0
Trash. Yes, it has some nice nifty features but it lacks in complete necessities to actually plan your day. You can make a task, perfectly include subtasks and then add a nice color to the task. But no yellow, because that's already the fixed color of the 'priority label'. Reminders are great, except you can only have one. If I want to have a reminder on Wednesday 10AM and a reminder on Friday 6PM, I'd need a different app. Because this app only allows you to set 1 reminder. Frustrating. 0/10;0
OMG the UI is awful, seriously you have popup for premium every 2 seconds, there's no intuitive way see a normal calendar, you have to create an account even if you don't want to, the app is beautiful but show screen where it's impossible to understand what you have to do. It's a calendar, show a f... calendar.;0
I've been using the app for a while and since last week it has been acting weird. I don't receive reminders anymore and it's completely a waste of time to set reminders! Not very reliable right now;0
"Unable to register with an email. Clicking""continue with email"" will just take you to a login page. Complete waste of time. I searched them first three pages of Google for a solution and found nothing. Found no solution on their help section. I don't want to register with Facebook or Google. If you include a feature, make sure it actually works.";0
Having to pay to set a recurring task is ridiculous and essentially makes the app useless to anyone who doesn't want to pay so this essentially is not a free app.;0
"Any.Forget... Had an instance of daily repeating event, that I have marked as complete today and somehow it did skip the next day and only proceeded to the day after. Kind of ""daily event with some days skipped"". So useless to me as can't be trusted for notifying about daily routine tasks. P.S. don't tell me I don't know how to setup a recurring event!!";0
I don't get task notifications anymore!!! This app has become useless. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, turned on / allowed notifications in the settings yet nothing.;0
This is an expensive app. That being said, it's the most low-rent experience you can imagine. For example, when you create a list item and need to edit it, you're completely out of luck because that can't happen. The best you can do is delete it and type it in (again) correctly since edit is not an option. By the way, deleting an item from your list is a multi multi step process. (update: developer noted that editing was possible (though, multiple steps required), item deletes still impossible);0
This app is useless unless you make the monthly payment, in that case does exist other app free and only with the essential;0
Ruined the app by trying to get too fancy. My wife has also become frustrated with it. She has had it since it started and now struggles with it. You should be able to add a task then go straight to set time/day. But instead, you have all the other short cuts there that really aren't.;0
It works okay, But I did not consent to subscribing at $28/year subscription. I thought I purchased it until I saw that it was renewed for an additional $28. It's definitely not worth that price. Very angry and ripped off. I got charged twice for something that I thought I bought outright. I will never buy anything from them. Ever;0
This last update has brought all kinds of bugs. Lists disappearing randomly, lists getting renamed, permissions randomly getting changed. All of these problems indicated serious bugs in the data model and potentially spillage of customer data. I would suggest looking into a new tasks app because the drop in quality has been dramatic.;0
Please add Shopping List widget or add a tab to quickly access the hopping list on current widgets. Otherwise, the shopping list is too many clicks to access. The only time you can see shipping lait is when opening the app and searching around for the shopping list icon. A shopping list widget would be best as it's a visual reminder TO GO SHOPPING for the item. Currently I'm adding reminders for every item to purchase instead so that it'll actually show up in my widget.;0
"It's testing the edge of my patience. Even though I have better internet connection it keeps saying ""couldn't find the Internet connection. Try again later"". It's my first time. I can't sign in so I can't go in to the app and plan anything. Already I tried reinstall twice.";0
I have set daily reminders. It doesn't show the reminders after few days. Due to which I missed many of activities. For example. I have set bath reminder at 8.30am but it has showed only for 2-3 days. From 4th day it went missing.;0
Pretty basic for the price. Lacks customisation. Desktop only gives month view - I'd prefer more options week, month, year, day. I had a query - links on the site don't work - TWO day turnaround! FOUR for standard account. Great productivity standard there! Very disappointed.;0
the app keeps crashing whenever I click something. was going to sign in with google but it just wont work and turns out nothing's working it just keeps crashing everytime I try. I hope it gets fixed. I'm really looking forward to using this app.;0
"Is it necessary to sign up account? While making a new account it's shows error ""oops try again later""";0
Updates made that are not fully tested. They need to add option to revert back to the olddd verison. that was simple to use, but most importantly it worked.;0
EVERY service I attempted to connect (Gmail, Gtasks, google calendar,) timed out during setup (oops error). Been 2 days and still no reply from support. Device is Samsung S9 with Android 10.;0
One star because the premium on Android only has 1 year option while premium on web has a monthly option. Edit: no it doesnt, when you go settings-> go premium the only option listed is Annual option;0
Had charged twice but still not getting premium version access,;0
This app is malware/scam. I don't even have the app and it's charged me 38 dollars for a yearly subscription, do not buy, I'm having to now look into suing the people behind this just based on the principle of not letting them get away with this. I hope the 38 dollars was worth hundreds of dollars in court fees.;0
Most useless app ever used! Very difficult to save anything or find anything! Put some tasks didn't get any reminders so didn't do it! Erasing this nonsense Can't even save this review;0
Have to pay for recurrent daily task.. which is the main purpose of that app.;0
"I had uninstalled and reinstalled it but still it doesn't work. When i open app to sign in by google it doesn't respond. It tells the msg ""app stop responding""";0
List sharing sharing is not working. UX is straight from iOS app, terrible;0
Is was disgusting.Routines would revert to previous if you make a change,name also changes randomly.this was Such mess i had to uninstall it.;0
No Grocery widget, Ridiculous... The task widget is confusing, I just want to be able to add stuff simply on the fly.;0
Not happy, app just asked me to 'sign in' and now has deleted all my previous reminders. I had reminders set up for throughout the rest of this year and now I don't know what they were. You've put me off using your app now, what's the point if it's not reliable!!!;0
Very slow app it took me 10 min just to start the app....;0
Automatically shows the reminder Snackbar when I open other apps without me setting it up, what kind of violation is this??? Stop bugging your users unsolicitedly. Uninstalled;0
This app is a prime example of building a mountain out of a mold hill. The developer does not knot how to make it simple & friendly. The app is very chaotic. Completed tasks do not go away after pressed completed. If deleted from today's list, tasks that have a repeat schedule also disappeared forever. The only reminder this app does right is to remind me how frustrating it is to use. I have uninstalled it on all my phones.;0
"App is getting worse instead of better. Latest version replaces homescreen widget that displayed five upcoming tasks with one that only displays three in the same space. All it gains in return is a useless ""Calendar"" button. WIdget colors that followed your main app theme replaced by ugly monochrome, too. I suspect they've put someone new in charge who decided they needed to ""shake things up"" with bad new ideas. Only bright spot is their tech support has been good.";0
"Under subtitle *security* ""However, please note that we cannot guarantee that the information will not be exposed as a result of unauthorized penetration to our servers"" Sorry no thanks.i just downloaded but after reading privacy policy i prefer going thru •Google official •one & app like calendar required lot of access ,&i personally don't wanna bleach my data like this..btw the tq for placing the info it to let us know :)";0
I have been using it since 2018 and am currently a paying subscriber but I wouldn't recommend it to others. Notifications do not pop up on my note 10 plus. WhatsApp notifications also did not appear for 2 straight days. I won't be renewing unless they get their act together;0
Interface is so rigid. To perform some basic tasks. You have to put lot of efforts. I have tried using this app to plan my day. Below are some issues: 1. To create a task, time interface requires lot of clicks. 2. Incase, if you have chosen the wrong date, you can not go back to select date page, you have to delete the task and create it again. 3. On the agenda page, it will show entries for other dates, but you cannot move task to other date directly. I want my money back.;0
"Something is wrong with the last version. Since I updated, I can't login. I use the right email & pass, and it keeps loading ""getting things ready"". I tried to delete and install again. Same problem. All of my stuff is there, and it's very annoying. I really like Any do and use it for years! I hope that you'll fix it soon cause i really don't want to leave to another app";0
Stop Adding Groceries Items Like an Ad;0
Absolutely worthless. This app runs a prohibitively clunky interface that effectively voids the promise of ease-of-life automation. Google Calendar will provide all other services promised by Any do for free with no annual subscription rate. Don't sign up for the free trial. It's not worth getting pinged for forty bucks when you decide you don't like it and forget to cancel it in time. Save your money!;0
Being an to do list app this app should be super simple, instead they made it complicated with UX. I can't understand single thing or can't understand single icon that is being used in the app. Bro's you are not making pubg game. When you are making something useful to users better serve it properly.;0
such a bad app,i try to click the log in button but it doesn't work,i exit from the app and i try again because i thought my phone was error but it still doesn't work..i uninstall the app and i reinstall again..the same things happened 😩;0
"After using for years, we'll uninstall it. Lately it has started duplicating me in our shared list with my wife. Yesterday I've decided to remove duplicate all but one duplicate me. I'm sure I've left 1 me in the list but nope, I've been removed completely from the list. Then we've tried adding ME to the list again but tried for 2 days and failed. Invitation appears put doesn't accept the ""ACCEPT"" button, only decline works...";0
BEWARE the trial period is a scam I've been using the free version for a while and decided to try the premium for 7 days per the trial ad. After 5 days I realized it didn't quite organize my information how I best work so I wrote to cancel. They informed me that I must have accidentally signed up for a non trial and by their strict Terms cannot refund me. So I wrote back nicely that my intention was to try it per the Ad, but they said it's not possible. Really?;0
I wanted to try the app but it never opens. I can't even sign up or sign in, tapping anything doesn't work. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, still the same. With this i stopped trying the app in a week, and opened it again today, updated the app, and still nothing can be clicked from the homepage. Idk if it's just my phone but my other apps are perfectly working and i never had this type of issue before;0
This App is useless , it works as a notepad with your tasks in it , it does not notify you of tasks you suppose to do. When the time reaches it's silent doesn't pop up even though settings have permitted it to pop up and alert , even a simple alarm clock notified me of what to do .This app Doesn't work .;0
I was a customer of Any.Do for a while and on March 2020 i clearly asked them NOT to renew my subscription as i found a different company to provide me task manger services - Todoist. More than that - i even consult with Any.Do technical support team how to transfer my database to Todoist and over the phone, i ALSO remind them to cancel it. I received the cancellation notice and I DID NOT ask them to renew/continue any of Any.Do services. More than that - i also have the Invoice from the company i moved my services, Todoist, for the same period of time that Any.Do charged me for. After i tried to contact Any.Do they refused to refund me. Therefore, i let you and everybody to know that I WILL NOT USE ANY OF ANY.DO services anymore and recommend everyone that read this post DO NOT USE ANY.DO SERVICES or you taking a big risk that something like that will happen to you as well.;0
Lots of issues, bugs, etc. I like the design and it could have been good otherwise but I'm looking for something else now.;0
I sent a cancelation request 3 day into the free trial and still you hit me with year. Very disappointed. I won't ever open this app again. besides it is not even a second rate app;0
Doesn't work even after turning off power optimization. One of the most lame excuse ever given by app development. Bulls*it app, go for Google ones, try this and regret.;0
I downloaded it and login with Google I never did anything just logged in with Google. It has asking me many time for auto debit for subscription so I uninstalled it. But still 5 min before Rs 909 debited from my account. This is the muging of money. I want refund my money in my account. Kindly;0
My CC was charged while I have unsubscribed the free trial mode and cancelled the subscribtion, how could this happen, the app is freezed, could not be used. Please refund my money. Thank you;0
There is some issue in payment.;0
App stopped functioning after my trial ended and I paid for the premium features. Now the app crashes and I cannot add new tasks. Support has been useless. Do not pay for this!!;0
Monthly fee for Dark mode, really? I could accept a one time payment for such a feature but not monthly.;0
Update: After getting a response from the developer I would change my rating to 0 stars if possible. These guys hide behind confusing and opaque terms and refuse to budge at all. I'm so annoyed that my money has been lost to them! Really terrible customer experience. Original: Be very careful when signing up for a free trial of this app. If you happen to go over they automatically charge you for a full years subscription and refuse to refund. Terrible customer experience and the app is just OK.;0
It doesn't give me the option to not sync with whatever else. Didn't even check it;0
Thanks to the developer for your quick response, however, this calendar is useless for our group without those features...we decided to go with Business Calendar Pro. Previous comments: Wasn't able to see month or year view;0
Your app sucks now!!!!! Used to be good but now doesn't update until I physically open it up and then close it then scroll and then it finally shows what I want to put on the list!!!!!! And I FRIGGEN paid for this garbage!!!!!!!;0
Used it for a fair amount of time without any problems. Suddenly then asked me to create an account or log using Google or FB. I used my Google one only to discover everything was gone!;0
Really disappointed to find recurring tasks functionality is only available with the paid version. Would not recommend. Also it doesn't sort tasks by date and time properly.;0
Loaded the trial then emailed about cancelation but email bounced back. Ended up paying $36 for an app I didn't want. No way to contact for refund. Be careful if you buy this. If you try the trial you're stuck paying for it!;0
I am not able to log in or do anything once i open the app. I would like to sign in with google but when i press on the button the whole app just closed😯😯 How could i continue?? I even tried download it again but still fail to run this app.;0
Slow. Not user friendly. If you type fast words repeat.;0
This application fails a lot and moreover it is complicated,weird and not intuitive. I don't renew my subscription.;0
New update issue. In widget, when I tap to add new task voice command opens along with the keyboard. Very annoying.;0
Im so disappointed with this app. I scheduled an Event and turned the reminder feature on. But it never alarmed me on the time I set. Uninstalling now.;0
I downloaded this app, but not able to respond, using vivo mob. Any solution please.;0
Suddenly the widget I have been using for years is gone. Every time, I update, I am worried of losing the widget or data;0
I instantly uninstalled because it is a ridiculously expensive subscription.;0
I can't sign in. It was working fine before but now i can't even sign in.;0
The fact that you have to pay so much to use something so simple isn't worth it to me. There are free apps of similar functionality.;0
Garbage. Every day only unique tasks. Not even a point to try any other features since there is just a create one time task for today page.;0
I used to be able to see my deliveries that were coming. Now it doesn't show that. This is not a useful app anymore;0
Getting comfronted with the buy option each time I use it. Frustrating.;0
Way over priced for what it does. Not worth it!;0
I reported about this app due to incorrect billing but noone answer me. Please, return my money back because app took my money without my permission from my credit card.;0
Was working ok until today...Now keeps crashing the moment you try to open d app...;0
complicated , dislike the pro version. microft to -do list is better;0
Forces you to sign up and use credentials, uninstalled.;0
I installed the app and I can't even sign in. What is wrong!?;0
Not easy to use also not effective;0
Worst app I have ever used, it doesn't do anything.;0
Doesn't give any notification and nothing I missed a registration!!;0
Wonderful and really helpful app for to be a topper;0
Just basic app without any exciting features. Why I pay for this useless app. Please don't download it's a cheat, waste of time and energy.;0
I do not have much to say in regards to the app itself. It seems to function fine, but it was not the calendar app that I needed. The reason I am giving it 1 star is because I canceled my subscription and account within the seven day free trial and still got charged the yearly rate. The problem has been reported to the company. I will keep this review updated with any action from Any.Do. UPDATE: The gist of the problem is this. Any.do makes it very difficult to find out how to cancel the sub.;0
I have the same recurring tasks to do every day. I need a to-do-list reminder to buzz me when it's time. The problem with this app, is that those reminder times somehow start drifting every day, giving me different times the next day! That is an annoying fail! Screw it, I'm going elsewhere. if I find a better app, I'll let you guys know. UPDATE : Suggestion did not work, and I found an app, that does not drift. I have moved on.;0
Keeps force closing, used to be good.;0
It won't let me in, it's freezing. And I just downloaded it right now. I couldn't even get to step one;0
It's not even logging in post the intial screen and I downloaded it just now. LAME!!!;0
I just needed a single program where I can can you record my voice notes;0
Not working and the list disappears after creation;0
This app used to be great when paired with Alexa. Every once in awhile the sync would break but disabling the app and relinking the account would fix the issue. This has not been the case for the past several months. Any.do it is no longer syncing with Alexa and based on the reviews of the Alexa app it is affecting a lot of people, has been ongoing for weeks, and there doesn't appear to be a fix coming. Going to give anylist a try to see if it works with Alexa.;0
All I want is a calendar. This app spams you so much. 1 star;0
The app seems ok and I get the appeal of asking users to pay for a subscription, but please don't go as far as asking for a paid subscription for changing the theme. Us, mobile users asked for dark themes for everything for a long time and they should be a normal thing, not a paid privilege. I will update my rating once that nonsense is taken care of. I'm not going to pay for a dark theme. PS: you can keep the other colours chargeable, but light and dark should always be free options.;0
Time setting is so dumb. Fix it;0
This is an overengineered list keeping app that I hate. I kept it for years in spite of that because I was in the ecosystem, but today it locked me out of my grocery list so good riddance. No i don't need it to take thirty seconds to boot up my grocery list so that your algorithm can tell me how to most productively plan my day by sorting my grocery list in order of the order I entered each item. I do not need an any.do minute.;0

Atleast make a few features available .. if the customer donot like the app at initial stage than how would he/she ever think about going premium;0
Requires a sign up for features I have no interest in using, but can't opt out of.;0
Did not sign up. App not even on my phone. This payment deduction will be reported and I request you refund my money immediately.;0
Autofill on Android 10 does not work;0
Had charged twice but still not getting premium version access,;0

"It's testing the edge of my patience. Even though I have better internet connection it keeps saying ""couldn't find the Internet connection. Try again later"". It's my first time. I can't sign in so I can't go in to the app and plan anything. Already I tried reinstall twice.";0
the app keeps crashing whenever I click something. was going to sign in with google but it just wont work and turns out nothing's working it just keeps crashing everytime I try. I hope it gets fixed. I'm really looking forward to using this app.;0
Finally decided to uninstall after using for over a year. A simple feature such as searching the task is not available even after requesting many times. Shifting to 'to do list' app which has very useful features including task searching & customisable recurring tasks.;0
Do you have smart date tagging?? Edit, any updates....;0
Not looking for an app where I need to pay;0
You have to sign in to use;0
The app seems ok and I get the appeal of asking users to pay for a subscription, but please don't go as far as asking for a paid subscription for changing the theme. Us, mobile users asked for dark themes for everything for a long time and they should be a normal thing, not a paid privilege. I will update my rating once that nonsense is taken care of. I'm not going to pay for a dark theme. PS: you can keep the other colours chargeable, but light and dark should always be free options.;0
Worst Paid app;0
"I had uninstalled and reinstalled it but still it doesn't work. When i open app to sign in by google it doesn't respond. It tells the msg ""app stop responding""";0
Please add Shopping List widget or add a tab to quickly access the hopping list on current widgets. Otherwise, the shopping list is too many clicks to access. The only time you can see shipping lait is when opening the app and searching around for the shopping list icon. A shopping list widget would be best as it's a visual reminder TO GO SHOPPING for the item. Currently I'm adding reminders for every item to purchase instead so that it'll actually show up in my widget.;0
Is was disgusting.Routines would revert to previous if you make a change,name also changes randomly.this was Such mess i had to uninstall it.;0
This is an expensive app. That being said, it's the most low-rent experience you can imagine. For example, when you create a list item and need to edit it, you're completely out of luck because that can't happen. The best you can do is delete it and type it in (again) correctly since edit is not an option. By the way, deleting an item from your list is a multi multi step process. (update: developer noted that editing was possible (though, multiple steps required), item deletes still impossible);0
This app is malware/scam. I don't even have the app and it's charged me 38 dollars for a yearly subscription, do not buy, I'm having to now look into suing the people behind this just based on the principle of not letting them get away with this. I hope the 38 dollars was worth hundreds of dollars in court fees.;0
Premium for recurring reminders? Seriously? Are we in 1920? 🤔;0
I am not able to use application in my mobile phone.;0
Expensive app;0
"App is getting worse instead of better. Latest version replaces homescreen widget that displayed five upcoming tasks with one that only displays three in the same space. All it gains in return is a useless ""Calendar"" button. WIdget colors that followed your main app theme replaced by ugly monochrome, too. I suspect they've put someone new in charge who decided they needed to ""shake things up"" with bad new ideas. Only bright spot is their tech support has been good.";0
I can't sign in. It was working fine before but now i can't even sign in.;0
"My rating is just based on my needs. The app says it has recurring tasks, it does not. It does have recurring reminders for ""on going"" tasks which may be useful in certain applications. The result of which being if you click on a task that you do everyday it puts the next reminder on the list giving the illusion the task was left undone. The exact opposite of what a checklist should do. If you want actual individual repeating tasks or list this is not the app.";0
Bare Bones. Integrations are a lie. You have to use a third party app to make it work and Zapier is garbage. Grocery list is kind of cool. Calendar has that annoying Apple style slide that hides evens and is impossible to read instead of traditional blocks. Support button is for bug fixes only, so premium support is also a lie.;0
I'm experiencing issues with the reminder option. Whenever I set a reminder I get neither the notification or the popup which as a result makes me forget things. This issue wasn't there before. What can be done to solve this?;0
Paid for a year's subscription BUT STILL HAVE TO PAY PER MONTH AND STILL HAVE PROBLEMS ACCESSING PREMUIM FACILITIES. I love this app and its incredibly helpful when it grants me access to the premium features that I have paid for. no one answers my emails!!!! Please can someone assist me?;0
It duplicates events, often with the incorrect time, and delete events I invite other to. Very aggravating.;0
A lot of basic features locked away behind a pay wall, not very customisable imo . Not the right to-do list app for me.;0
Used to love this app. After the latest update its garbage! Can't turn off the automatic date/time thing that erases what you put in and sends it to that date or time. Will hang onto it for a bit in hopes that a new update will fix this issue. Or at least give the option to turn it off.;0
1) When i access from pc it shows different calander google account. And when i access from phone it shows different google account (i use 4 different gmail accounts) 2) also when a task is completed or deleted from the app, without touching the notification bar on phone, notification on phone stays. It has to be swiped away manually. So i have to use two actions to delete one tasks.;0
I love using this app however when I installed it to one of my phones I cannot login to it. It just keeps closing. I don't know what's wrong. Also I wish the widget would contain date and time of the tasks not just tick marks.;0
The website boasts that any.do is the best grocery list app for Android Wear. Lies. There is no way to view lists on Android Wear, only add tasks. You can view lists on Apple Watch. This is the feature I need and I guess I'll look elsewhere.;0
The update is annoying. I want to add time on the list. But you just add time tag feature which make the time that i put not being displayed.;0
For me it frequently stops syncing. I currently can't get it working again. But when it was working it was great.;0
I like it at lot, but it seems like recently, this v thing is taking out my battery, hogging memory, and using data more than chrome which I use constantly. Until someone can help me figure this out, or if this high usage of phone resources is normal, I can't rate it any higher. I might even have to remove it and search for an alternative.;0
Used to be good but now doesn't even notify me (and yes this is with the settings amended accordingly);0
"Buggy interface. The grocery list feature is fine but the schedule is terrible. It kept changing event details after I saved. I had to go back in and turn off alarms for previously saved events (that I had alarms off). And it would NOT let me create an all day event that was only scheduled one day. No matter how many times I changed the dates it kept including the day before in my ""all day"" event. And then when I would try to edit it, it would change completely to two days before. What a mess.";0
In a word: clunky. I like the calendar integration, however everything else is basic and clunky. Simply adding a task to a list takes 3 clicks and you CANNOT SET A DATE, TIME, SUBTASKS, OR NOTES UNLESS YOU EXIT OUT OF THE TASK AND GOING BACK TO YOUR LIST. The app is designed to give you as many notifications as it can and constantly advertise the premium version. And whatever you do, DO NOT SIGN UP FOR A FREE TRIAL UNLESS YOU'RE WILLING TO SPEND AN HOUR SEARCHING FOR HOW TO DO SO.;0
Not the bloody annoying calendar/task widget thing again. You did this once before. I don't want to use your calendar, just the task list so please bring back the option of a widget without the calendar option written at the top. Will use an alternative until I see AnyDo has been updated.;0
It stopped showing reminders and notifications!!!!!;0
Thought it be a great replacement for GTasks. Main issue with Tasks is lack of pc app. I like the any.do widget as it has a transparent option. I use recurring tasks a lot. A routine which can be ticked and on the next day they'll reappear, which I found seemeles in the Google app. Unfortunately in any.do you need to set a reminder for each task with exact time, they don't stack on each other, creating a long list of notifications in the morning. Also no visual event line in calendar month view.;0
"The grocery list is not syncing properly and is missing items that my wife added on her phone. This has caused issues for us where I've missed items when shopping. This is particularly bad considering the current quarantine and the fact that I have to queue up to get into the shop in the first place. I've tested and when I add the item ""snacks"" on my wife's phone they don't appear on my grocery list. I can not recommend this app currently because of this.";0
It doesn't sync up with Google Tasks. Not worth the change. Zapier does not work for Android. Zapier only works if you pay the Premium fee plus it only gives the option to add new tasks and complete tasks when integrating with Google Tasks. It does not import current tasks previously created in Google Tasks. There is no way to transfer my 144 tasks from Google to Anydo. And I can't afford $72.00 right off the bat to do it.;0
"NEW: Great concept but NOT for confidential data because it's not encrypted (nor PW protected on phone or PC) and, one day, Any.Do company will get hacked & ALL your stuff be be out there, like EquiFax. RESOLVED: App loses your work. eg: I created a new task, started a ""notes"" section, pasted it in some material and clicked save. Then I went to another app to get more material but when I returned to any.do, my notes were GONE!. Your ""save"" button is fraudulent if it does not save when clicked!";0
I've enjoyed using this app since I got it two weeks ago until recently, when it began crashing when I'd add tasks.;0
You can' t manage it easily per day, the interface is not clear when i click on a day I want to say only that day agenda not others around it. When i add a task it doesn t show me in which day is added - i have at least ten ideas to improve. They contact me, i will uninstall it for now. I submitted few complaints but there are more;0
I'm sure the app is great seeing all the positive reviews not had earned. But having dark mode being ba premium feature is a deal breaker for me, because I would like to extensively test a product before considering a premium subscription but I can't get to use an app that forces light mode why all of my other apps are dark;0
There is a issue with Notes. For as long as I can remeber you sometimes add a note and it's gone later. I keep having to go out and come back each time I add one in hope it's saved.;0
I mean the app started seeming really nice and has a lot of work put into it but here me out if your looking for a app that is free and dont want to spend $ for daily reminders this is not it but if you dont mind paying like 7 $ this your app and with that 7 dollars you can get cool extra stuff;0
Nice polished but useless. There is no filter for tags. Web and app synch problems happens missing tasks. Not any scoring system. May good for amateurs but not for project managers. However I like the calendar view.;0
Hi Developer. Need to improve note module. It fix only for protrait view, which is when I'm using landscape view (tablet with keyboard), I need to adjust my head or the gadget. TQ;0
This app always put the things I haven't done to the next day. I don't like this. It should be stay at there if I didn't finished the work nor help me move to the next day and ask me to do it! If I didn't finished it, I'll continue the work tomorrow. I don't need you to help me move the task to the next day. It's annoying;0
Poor widget options, which is what I needed most. Very space inefficient and not customizable at all. Disappointing. Todoist had the most compact and useful widget, followed by Microsoft ToDo.;0
Themes and location based reminders are under subscription. Both are free on most of apps like this. Thanks but no. I'll pass and keep using Google keep;0
It's a fine app but logs me out every other time I go to use it.;0
Is there no way to assign a specific color to an event? I like to group my meetings by color. If I can't do that, the app isn't useful for me.;0
Missing grocery list widget and quantity for grocery list items!!!;0
It can't adjust tasks with real-time line.;0
Paywall, even for dark theme. Very disappointed;0
The design is nice but it doesn't understand when I said 'later'. When I said remind me tomorrow morning, it replied okay I'll be reminded tomorrow at 16:00+. That's afternoon. I'll be very well roasted by my boss by then. Can't find any help on these issues. Was close to confirming my subscription. Sad ☹️;0
Keep losing mini steps after I write them down.;0
"The app was an okay task organizer at best, although it required internet and was ridden with adds and paywalls for a monthly ""premium"" subscription. Even if they asked for support, id prefer a one time payment of a higher amount like, $5 to unlock all features.";0
For an app that's meant to help me organise my time more effectively, I didn't expect it would take the longest time to boot up compared to all the utility apps on my device... Really nice UI though...;0
Uninstalled. I want a simple reminder app that will put a daily notification in my notification bar, every single day. Nothing else. No other features. But this is so bloated with features, it's impossible to know if it might do this or not.;0
List feature sucks! I don't need to manage myself so I can't speak to that functionality. I just wanted a list app, preferably one that worked with Google Assistant. Although that feature works great, the list feature kind of sucks. In an attempt to look new and edgy, the user experience went down the drain. I found it clunky & irritating. I shouldn't have to add a new item to the grocery list just to be able to uncheck items I need again. And that's just one of many irritations. AnyList baby!;0
Trying to set a reoccuring event changes the date to one day before what I set it as. Trying to change the date back just creates a second event. Then trying to delete both events takes several tries, because half the time they don't actually delete. This is really annoying.;0
I like the app but the fact that there are lots of other apps that can do the same thing ... it's imo ridiculous to charge a monthly fee.. they justify it by saying it's a service blabla it's an to do app. More people would actually pay for it if it wouldn't be a subscription model.;0
I actually love this and have use this for a year but the new update is no good at all that I need to edit my review due to the changes...;0
Not so great. The user interface is not friendly. Making the to do list takes far too long and theres no way (that i found) to make a list that repeats daily. I'll just stick to google keep.;0
The latest update is terrible. I always organized everything by date of the reminder, which is usually set on the day that it's due, but now I can't even see the due date of each task. I have to click on each task for the the date to appear. In addition, I usually organize each task by tags, the date, recurring if needed, and other details. There's no easy way to adjust all these details anymore. You have to click on each separate icon to fix these to what you want. I use the app begrudgingly.;0
When I saw that Dark Theme was premium only I stopped and uninstalled immediately. Frankly I was insulted. Are you hoping to squint me into submission? If I can't try your app comfortably then why bother? There are identical apps (I'm exploring now) that you're competing with, so think about making the app comfortable to use for free with restrictions I would pay to lift. It's like... youtube giving volume control only to premium members or test driving a new car without getting to use A/C.;0
Stupid popup reminding me to add reminders or do something covers my keypad and stays for a long time with no way to close it. I can't keep checked off items. It reminds me multiple times, every couple of seconds, to clear off the checked items, again blocking me. I can't move items between lists and if there is a way, it isn't easy enough for me to figure out. Cumbersome.;0
I tried it years ago and never really got it going. Then I switched to Wunderlist and became an organized machine! Now Wunderlist is being retired, so I thought I'd try again, guessing it would be much better by now and that my ability to use it to my advantage would be vastly improved. Nope. No ability for folders or some other way to group lists together so I don't have to flip through all my lists to find the one I want. Not even a list view to make them easier to find.;0
Recurring tasks are very glitchy - they sometimes change the day or time when they recur. Per any.do's request i sent them a video of this happening... crickets. No explanation or acknowledgement and no refund as i requested. Fine otherwise, but i rely on recurring items.;0
I used to depend on this app to basically run my life, until I installed the latest (as of Mar 19) update. Now it doesn't sync properly with my smartwatch -- ticking tasks off on my watch no longer marks them complete on my phone. Also, the widget is broken now, and doesn't reflect changes I've made unless I restart my phone. I sent a support request to the help team, but have gotten total radio silence. If they don't fix it, I'm cancelling my subscription. Right now it's not worth paying for.;0
I find the app inflexible and buggy, with a counter intuitive UI. How to delete or rename tags was not obvious. Using the back button would often exit the app at unusual times. After adding a new tag the app wouldn't allow me to do anything until I exited and restarted. Plus, the premium features seem more like essential features, to me. Looking for an alternative app as we speak.;0
Only rated 2 stars because of the ability to sync with the calendar apps on the phone and the ability to cross out any tasks once finished. However, the app is fairly simple with tasks laid out like a shopping or to do list with the inability to edit the timings of tasks. I had set an appointment for 1:30 but the app had automatically set it for 10:00 am and not allowing me to edit it. Also, it would have been nice for the tasks to be laid out in calendar format with color-coding options.;0
Constant prompts for trials and upgrades. Super annoying.;0
Once the app reinstalled itself and I lost everything. I still have no idea why it did this. Also, it often doesn't open when I first tap the icon. If I tap it multiple times it eventually opens within a particular task. I found it frustrating and I've now uninstalled it. It would be a great app if some of these bugs could be resolved.;0
Ok it was good app but all the good feature are in premium no use of downloading if I'm not satisfied why would i pay for a premium one;0
Nawww, sorry your yearly subscription price scared me off. By the time I've subscribed to every app I consider helpful I'm spending waaay too much. I would have liked it but I have other much more important bills to pay. The low stars is due to the price and there's no point in coming back to justify it because it'll still be too much for me. Edit: I know that I can use it for free, but then I'd still have to put up with ads. Surprisingly I don't like ads. I still consider your sub too much.;0
I don't care for it, when I first opened it it showed me all these appointments. I was thinking what the heck then I figured out it was showing me weeks passed along with the current. To me that's just a bunch of clutter. Then it was telling me I had five appointments this month, no, only have one, it only showed the one but it still says 5. I don't have a clue what the other four are. Anytime I try to do anyting it practically begged me to join premium, I just uninstalled it.;0
Must register with email, Google or FB -- displaying your email address -- just to get onto app. Smack dab near beginning of setup process (full page, per each setting), a full page ad to buy premium version appears. Getting into app? -- Stayed just a min, with the boxed, staring at the boxed, text notification that we have seven (7) days to try app for free. Already concerned about/not liking having to register online to use, stopped setup process, at that page. Uninstalling right now.;0
Brilliant app for older versions of Android. This app have helped me keep track of my tasks at work and personal very effectively for years. It is very easy to use. I have upgraded to Android Oreo, and reminder pop up stopped for my tasks. Contacted support, but they couldn't figure out how to fix. I appreciate they tried their best. I've migrated to Splendo as a stop gap arrangement till I find a better app as good as any.do. 2 * given, as this app is working just as a notepad to me to list tasks, but I don't get any form of reminders.;0
It used to be a slick, minimal app that did what it needed to. Then they kept adding layers of unneeded features and forced people to make an account just to use it. No thanks.;0
"The notification bar does not work. The ""Add Task"" option appears, I enter the task and click on the icon, there's just a progress spinner. The ""Close"" icon does not dismiss the notification bar either. How inconvenient. Had this issue in Oreo too. Right now I am on Nougat. Also the animations inside the app are slow. The icon where you tap to 'tick' the task is very small.";0
It's a mess. I add new tasks and tag them. But they will randomly disappear, reappear. And the tags will disappear. Editing and adding them back in doesn't help because once a tag disappears you can't add it back in again. Disappearing tasks is the worst because there's no warning. They're just gone. They're not listed as complete, they just disappear. Sometimes they'll come back but sometimes I have to re-enter them...assuming I remember. I pay for this app, so the fact that the basic functionality of keeping my list intact is random and spotty is unacceptable. It may have something to do with syncing... no idea. But either way, I'm going to use another app because I just don't trust it anymore. These errors seem to be recent, like in the last 3 months.;0
"Deleted review accidentally. 1. I create habit type tasks: the ones that repeat regularly. I don't even dream to have a habit/statistical section, but THERE HAS TO BE A WAY TO SKIP OR FAIL THE REPEATABLE TASK. Now I only can delete it, but is is not representative way. 2. There has to be a way to exclude a list from the ""all tasks"" list. For example I have list with books to read and films to watch. A lot of tasks, that look bad in the ""all tasks"" list, I loose real important ""no date"" tasks because of it. You redirect me to your uservoice, but according to it excluding list from ""all tasks"" list has been ""in roadmap"" for 2 years, don't think you really care and your uservoice makes any difference. I know that adding habit tracker might be a heavy feature, but failing the task, or skipping it? Hell no. As well as excluding lists feature, it's also an easy one. But two years? Meh. Just don't pretend you care, be straightforward, like, 'we won't do it in the nearest future, not in our plans'.";0
Was interested in trying out the premium features until I saw that they're a subscription, and a ridiculously priced one at that. Unfortunately the simple functionality of note taking, which used to be handled very well by many apps seems to be harder to come by. Haven't found an app yet that will integrate with Google assistant in any useful way.;0
Beautifully designed interface, but VERY CLICK-BAITY / PUSHY - I would NOT recommend.;0
At first I thought 'wow this can do everything! It's exactly what I need.' When I downloaded it and got to test it out, I noticed the features I needed the most were on premium. I'm fine with that, but only if premium was a one time payment. Not monthly payments for a membership. Monthly payments are for bills, taxes, video subscriptions, vpns, maybe even online storage subscriptions, but most definitely not calendars or to do lists. Those should stay as free or a small one time payment.;0
i had installed the trial version but did not use and it was of no use at my end. to my surprise i see today getting an sms from vodafone to be charged Rs.1028 for one year subscription. i contacted vodafone and they told me to delete .the app within 48hrs of installation which i did. pl cancel this subscription as its of no use to me so that this charges could be credited back by vodafone to me. Developer - pl refund back my money as i dont use it.;0
It constantly crashes and misses a lot of functionality. Hard to use and annoys with some popups that can be discarded only by closing app and then opening it again and permanent noticfaction that CAN'T be disabled. Payd 30 euro for this and used for month before it got so annoying that I started to look for another app. Fortunately I found one - Todoist. It's unbelievable how much better that is. Also there is version of todoist for PC, for your smart watch and even as browser extension which allows you to easily set a certain web page as task. And all these are synced.;0
This is a nicely made app and premium is cheap, but one critical flaw is the reminder sound runs through the ringtone channel instead of the alarm channel, or even the media channel. So unless you enjoy hearing every single notification go off on your phone or your ears are super sensitive to vibrations from across the room this app is not fit for purpose. A shame I just pooched my free trial now;0
I really liked the app for its simplicity. That changed tremendously with the recent updates. For example, it now takes me 10 clicks to postpone a single task! People use To Do apps to improve their efficiency, but this app isn't efficient anymore at all. I hope the simplicity comes back with future updates...;0
This is a good app with somewhat helpful widgets. The widget calendar should include tasks on individual days. Events and their notification settings are lacking. If I want to be notified 2 weeks in advance, I simply can't.. In Google Calender, I can set it 4 weeks in advance. With this app I have to set the event date 1 week before it happens and set the notification to 1 week in advance in order to get 2 week notice. These restrictions are a dealbreaker.;0
"***UPDATE 5/29/19 - I decided to go ahead & do the trial so I could see how the location reminder works. So far I've tried about 3 different locations & none of them have updated. One of them was even my home. This was about 30 mins ago! I've been waiting for the app to work with Google Assistant. It's been saying""coming soon"" for quite some time. When this happens I may consider doing the premium. Until then the 7 day trial is pointless to see how the service completely works. Maybe one day...😥";0
Easy setup for the most part but ended up deleting it. Only one level of subtasks makes the to do list suboptimal. Only links to Google based calendars so my work, school and personal calendars aren't seen. [there is a disconnect between the app and the referenced article's options and instructions]. I don't mind paying for premium features as long as it is a one-time payment, the whole SAAS model is annoying.;0
The concept is good but the execution lacks. There are constant issues with server sync, and since the server side has priority, updates I make on the phone regularly get wiped out. Every so often the app will prompt me to log in again when I open it...this time it just kicked me out while I was actively using it and updating a list, made me log in again, and didn't keep anything I had already done! My wife already gave up on it and I will probably look elsewhere too;0
I was willing to give this a try to see if it suits my needs. Seemed ok, with limited use so far. The only thing more annoying than constant notifications from apps is at 9am when my phone vibrates and Any.Do takes over the whole screen and asks me to plan my day. I don't need it taking over things, i will plan when i want. Are you seriously doing this? It is the equivalent of a browser popup and very annoying.;0
Not a fan of being constantly reminded the moment I begin 2 experience your app that every setting or option is not fully functional or could be better with a subscription Everytime I look @ settings I'm reminded, when I configure the app I'm told about the subscription of $35/year. How bout letting users experience the full benefits of what u have 2 offer for 30 days b4 making us sign a yearly sub instead of 7 day free trial? This is an opportunity 4 u to humble your customer base #SunriseApp;0
Sorry, not Impressed I'm sorry to leave a poor review, but I thought it best to let the developers and others know I had so many challenges with it I wouldn't know where to begin. :( UPDATE: Although I initially gave the app a one star, I upgraded to two because their response was kind and professional. They asked for details of the challenges I had with the app and were genuinely pleasant to correspond with. So if you have a complaint, share kindly because they really do care. :);0
This app was fantastic when I first downloaded. However, now my monthly recurring task pops up evey day. No idea why. when it wasn't doing that before. I've tried deleting and adding again. But, it does the same thing. Really annoying.;0
Frustrated that all the useful features are only for premium. not complaining that they are set up that way, but that they dont let you know until you are set up. Also its calendar wont work unless you import an external calendar? defeats the purpose of having a separate calendar. without premium its identical to a hundred other free apps.;0
The actual free version doesn't allow you anything, not even to learn how to use the app properly. That role is filled by 7 days of free premium. The free, on the description, is a lie. Is a paid-only app with temporary free access to its full features that gets practically useless after the 7-day trial. If you can get past that sort of business practice to actually try it I think the app may be great, but I don't like to be lied to. Edit: I opted for TicTic after some experiments.;0
"Can't clean up old Alexa lists! We use this purely for the Alexa shopping list integration. However, early on it was very buggy, so we had to relink our Alexa account a number of times. And now we have like 4 or 5 old ""Alexa shopping list""s that we cannot delete! ""Alexa lists can not be modified with Any.do. You can do it from the Alexa app""... No, I can not, because it only deletes the working one!";0
I had hope for this Calendar app but apparently in order to see the calendar in a normal format as to the list format, you have to pay a premium, & that is not what I want to do. I'm very disappointed uninstalling & will be looking for another calendar app. All in all it seams like a good calender app but just not for me.;0
Worked great at first but continously does not sync completely with Alexa. I only use this app as a shopping list with Alexa, but when it only shows 4 of 10 items on my list it's pretty useless. The purpose of the list is so that I don't have to remember the 10 items I told Alexa to add to the list (which show up on todoist);0
Can't change font sizes (old guy) and even with premium trial, can not change recurring task to monthly day of month from monthly day of week. Or, I should say you can make the change, but next time viewing task it shows - repeat every third Monday of the month - rather than - every month on the 20th. Also, I don't see a way to force sync account, . . . if that matters.;0
Hard-to-read interface. Tiny font makes it such a strain. No contrast option available either, as far as I can tell. Reminder times are displayed in an even more unfriendly font. Not everyone has perfect vision. Disappointed that the creators of this app haven't thought this through.;0
I had made an account for this app a long time ago but didn't use it for long and I forgot why until I re-downloaded it today. This is one of those apps that's incredibly frustrating because a lot of the main advertised features are behind a pay wall and/or you have to make an ADDITIONAL ACCOUNT FOR. Paying more than $1/mo for a list app is ridiculous. If anything it should be a one-time purchase.;0
I was about to jump wholeheartedly into using this app (its integration with Google Calendar being exactly what I'm looking for) but now I see that it has no search feature on Android. Worse still, Android Search has been on their roadmap since 2015 and it's still not done. 2015!?! In the meantime other apps can build smart lists it out of tags, status and free text. Seriously behind the curve, guys.;0
My experience with the app is fantastic, but a strange experience occurred, to me, i run parallel two emails, the one with which i presently registered offers Rs 909/ per annum subscription rate, on the contrary, with my new email it offers Rs 606 / per annuum. There is a huge difference of approximately 300 rupess. That's tantamount to cheating. Di satisfied and aghast with open cheating!!;0
To make the difference between missed and successful appointments, could you please modify this app with the following: -Grayed out events for events already lapsed within the day -in app notification tones different than that of the phone for calendar events since distinguishing them will make it easier to ascertain what notifications I'm receiving and will make me habitually more organised I passionately ask you to please press on these features in updating this calendar app as soon as possible. A lot of my appointments are work related and I don't want to be put at risk. Thank you in abundance, Daniel;0
Recurring tasks are behind a pay wall. Ridiculous to have to pay a monthly subscription for such a simple feature App is a little ugly and not customisable.;0
Why so expensive? Microsoft Task or reminder offer most of the features that this app has. Could you please decrease the price a little bit? Or give me some discount? Atleast for the first Year?;0
Syncing with Alexa takes over 10-15 minutes which renders it unusable. Any.do, before you post your generic response: yes, I added the skill to my Alexa and, yes, I logged into my accounts. It syncs... kind of... so I can verify the two accounts are talking... just not well at all. When I use Wunderlist or Google Tasks or just Alexa by itself, the changes are instantly viewable across all platforms. The only reason I downloaded with app was to give me more control over my Alexa lists (which for some insane reason you cannot reorder). The extremely lag in syncing Any.do with Alexa renders this app useless. The UI looks really nice and user friendly, so I bumped it up to 2 stars.;0
It sorely needs and UNDO (& backup/restore/revert) feature in case we accidentally touch/swipe a circle/bullet which then gets unintentionally deleted immediately (which I find incredibly frustrating). (It also needs a flexible feature to import & export other common text/data formats like CSV, XML, events to & from calendar… not just copy reminders to tasks) If Google fixes all that then I'd give it 5-stars!;0
I found it hard to get a calender not connected to my Google Calender or Google email. Once you do this, you have given Google even more access to your personal lives through giving them your whereabouts recorded on your calender. I understand some may want the upside of being able to back up their calender if something happens to their phones. I don't. My previous phone had a built in calender widget that did not require me to sync with Google in any way.;0
A lot of basic features locked away behind a pay wall, not very customisable imo . Not the right to-do list app for me.;0
Ok it was good app but all the good feature are in premium no use of downloading if I'm not satisfied why would i pay for a premium one;0
It duplicates events, often with the incorrect time, and delete events I invite other to. Very aggravating.;0
Constant prompts for trials and upgrades. Super annoying.;0
Don't have a monthly plan;0
Paid for a year's subscription BUT STILL HAVE TO PAY PER MONTH AND STILL HAVE PROBLEMS ACCESSING PREMUIM FACILITIES. I love this app and its incredibly helpful when it grants me access to the premium features that I have paid for. no one answers my emails!!!! Please can someone assist me?;0
"My rating is just based on my needs. The app says it has recurring tasks, it does not. It does have recurring reminders for ""on going"" tasks which may be useful in certain applications. The result of which being if you click on a task that you do everyday it puts the next reminder on the list giving the illusion the task was left undone. The exact opposite of what a checklist should do. If you want actual individual repeating tasks or list this is not the app.";0
Beautifully designed interface, but VERY CLICK-BAITY / PUSHY - I would NOT recommend.;0
Bare Bones. Integrations are a lie. You have to use a third party app to make it work and Zapier is garbage. Grocery list is kind of cool. Calendar has that annoying Apple style slide that hides evens and is impossible to read instead of traditional blocks. Support button is for bug fixes only, so premium support is also a lie.;0
I'm experiencing issues with the reminder option. Whenever I set a reminder I get neither the notification or the popup which as a result makes me forget things. This issue wasn't there before. What can be done to solve this?;0
Rimnder alram ka bhi option h ya nhi;0
Loved this app but I prefer writing things down;0
Ordinary updates delete reminders;0
Why pay for such simplicity?;0
For an app that's meant to help me organise my time more effectively, I didn't expect it would take the longest time to boot up compared to all the utility apps on my device... Really nice UI though...;0
Why so expensive? Microsoft Task or reminder offer most of the features that this app has. Could you please decrease the price a little bit? Or give me some discount? Atleast for the first Year?;0
I like it at lot, but it seems like recently, this v thing is taking out my battery, hogging memory, and using data more than chrome which I use constantly. Until someone can help me figure this out, or if this high usage of phone resources is normal, I can't rate it any higher. I might even have to remove it and search for an alternative.;0
Can't repeat task at custom intervals;0
It stopped showing reminders and notifications!!!!!;0
Uninstalled. I want a simple reminder app that will put a daily notification in my notification bar, every single day. Nothing else. No other features. But this is so bloated with features, it's impossible to know if it might do this or not.;0
Couldn't get the hang of it, I want something simple and cheaper to remind me of birthdays and dog to vets etc;0
Too annoying premium advertising, darkmode is premium only;0
"The app was an okay task organizer at best, although it required internet and was ridden with adds and paywalls for a monthly ""premium"" subscription. Even if they asked for support, id prefer a one time payment of a higher amount like, $5 to unlock all features.";0
Used to be good but now doesn't even notify me (and yes this is with the settings amended accordingly);0
Some of the sentences on my lists go off the screen, so we need an option to wrap the text when it reaches the right side of the screen. As of June 4, 2017, I can not sign on anymore using samsung galaxy after upgrading to Android 7.0 software. As of 6-19-2020, I never did get any.do to work on my Samsung galaxy s7, but it now works on my Samsung note 8.;0
You better don't rotate your phone from vertical to horizontal when typing new task, because it will be GONE. Any.Do support team said 2 years ago that it will be fixed, but it's still not. Also I have over 80 tasks and would love to see the search feature and ability to sort tasks by the date of their creation and by the alert date. The search was implemented but I don't know how to use it. Probably it works only on paid version.;0
i liked it because of plan a tree cz i really needed it but it's expensive soo.. k bye;0
The update is annoying. I want to add time on the list. But you just add time tag feature which make the time that i put not being displayed.;0
LAGGIN! cannot open. Tq;0
Recurring reminders are available for free in Google reminder. You can't Monetize the basic functions.;0
For me it frequently stops syncing. I currently can't get it working again. But when it was working it was great.;0
Doesnt work on windows;0
1) When i access from pc it shows different calander google account. And when i access from phone it shows different google account (i use 4 different gmail accounts) 2) also when a task is completed or deleted from the app, without touching the notification bar on phone, notification on phone stays. It has to be swiped away manually. So i have to use two actions to delete one tasks.;0
not user friendly.;0
Used to love this app. After the latest update its garbage! Can't turn off the automatic date/time thing that erases what you put in and sends it to that date or time. Will hang onto it for a bit in hopes that a new update will fix this issue. Or at least give the option to turn it off.;0
The website boasts that any.do is the best grocery list app for Android Wear. Lies. There is no way to view lists on Android Wear, only add tasks. You can view lists on Apple Watch. This is the feature I need and I guess I'll look elsewhere.;0
Reminder does not pop up on time or in some cases, does not pop up at all;0
I love using this app however when I installed it to one of my phones I cannot login to it. It just keeps closing. I don't know what's wrong. Also I wish the widget would contain date and time of the tasks not just tick marks.;0
Not the bloody annoying calendar/task widget thing again. You did this once before. I don't want to use your calendar, just the task list so please bring back the option of a widget without the calendar option written at the top. Will use an alternative until I see AnyDo has been updated.;0
Paywall, even for dark theme. Very disappointed;0
Not yet solved. Cannot log in;0
I need this app to share tasks real time with my significant other. Unfortunately, when she is adding tasks from iOS, sometimes they do no show up for me. Switching to Microsoft To Do and no problems. Additionally, being able to paste multiple cells from Excel makes MS offering indispensable, something I would sorely miss if I returned to Any.do.;0
useless;0
It can't adjust tasks with real-time line.;0
I actually love this and have use this for a year but the new update is no good at all that I need to edit my review due to the changes...;0
In a word: clunky. I like the calendar integration, however everything else is basic and clunky. Simply adding a task to a list takes 3 clicks and you CANNOT SET A DATE, TIME, SUBTASKS, OR NOTES UNLESS YOU EXIT OUT OF THE TASK AND GOING BACK TO YOUR LIST. The app is designed to give you as many notifications as it can and constantly advertise the premium version. And whatever you do, DO NOT SIGN UP FOR A FREE TRIAL UNLESS YOU'RE WILLING TO SPEND AN HOUR SEARCHING FOR HOW TO DO SO.;0
Whuup, sorry, need to pay for unlimited daily task. Nope;0
"Buggy interface. The grocery list feature is fine but the schedule is terrible. It kept changing event details after I saved. I had to go back in and turn off alarms for previously saved events (that I had alarms off). And it would NOT let me create an all day event that was only scheduled one day. No matter how many times I changed the dates it kept including the day before in my ""all day"" event. And then when I would try to edit it, it would change completely to two days before. What a mess.";0
Free version is very limited compared to Ticktick and Microsoft To Do.;0
I've enjoyed using this app since I got it two weeks ago until recently, when it began crashing when I'd add tasks.;0
"The grocery list is not syncing properly and is missing items that my wife added on her phone. This has caused issues for us where I've missed items when shopping. This is particularly bad considering the current quarantine and the fact that I have to queue up to get into the shop in the first place. I've tested and when I add the item ""snacks"" on my wife's phone they don't appear on my grocery list. I can not recommend this app currently because of this.";0
I mean the app started seeming really nice and has a lot of work put into it but here me out if your looking for a app that is free and dont want to spend $ for daily reminders this is not it but if you dont mind paying like 7 $ this your app and with that 7 dollars you can get cool extra stuff;0
When I saw that Dark Theme was premium only I stopped and uninstalled immediately. Frankly I was insulted. Are you hoping to squint me into submission? If I can't try your app comfortably then why bother? There are identical apps (I'm exploring now) that you're competing with, so think about making the app comfortable to use for free with restrictions I would pay to lift. It's like... youtube giving volume control only to premium members or test driving a new car without getting to use A/C.;0
I have cancelled my subscription. An amount of Rs. 909.90 has been deducted from my account. Kindly refund the same. I'm not interested in the app;0
This app always put the things I haven't done to the next day. I don't like this. It should be stay at there if I didn't finished the work nor help me move to the next day and ask me to do it! If I didn't finished it, I'll continue the work tomorrow. I don't need you to help me move the task to the next day. It's annoying;0
"Lost another star for your reply to my previous comment. I like the ""moment"" notification. I like planning my day.. i hate the dumb sounds I can't turn off for every item I snooze.";0
I'm sure the app is great seeing all the positive reviews not had earned. But having dark mode being ba premium feature is a deal breaker for me, because I would like to extensively test a product before considering a premium subscription but I can't get to use an app that forces light mode why all of my other apps are dark;0
Not free;0
You can' t manage it easily per day, the interface is not clear when i click on a day I want to say only that day agenda not others around it. When i add a task it doesn t show me in which day is added - i have at least ten ideas to improve. They contact me, i will uninstall it for now. I submitted few complaints but there are more;0
Important features locked behind a pay wall.;0
A suspicious app! Do not recommend this application.;0
Poor widget options, which is what I needed most. Very space inefficient and not customizable at all. Disappointing. Todoist had the most compact and useful widget, followed by Microsoft ToDo.;0
Keep losing mini steps after I write them down.;0
Thought it be a great replacement for GTasks. Main issue with Tasks is lack of pc app. I like the any.do widget as it has a transparent option. I use recurring tasks a lot. A routine which can be ticked and on the next day they'll reappear, which I found seemeles in the Google app. Unfortunately in any.do you need to set a reminder for each task with exact time, they don't stack on each other, creating a long list of notifications in the morning. Also no visual event line in calendar month view.;0
Estou tendo dificuldades com alguns bugs..;0
There is a issue with Notes. For as long as I can remeber you sometimes add a note and it's gone later. I keep having to go out and come back each time I add one in hope it's saved.;0
I like the app but the fact that there are lots of other apps that can do the same thing ... it's imo ridiculous to charge a monthly fee.. they justify it by saying it's a service blabla it's an to do app. More people would actually pay for it if it wouldn't be a subscription model.;0
Doesn't show empty hours like Gcalender, also asking me to subscribe from the get go.;0
We dont use it. Like at all. Its not that different from your regular phone calendar. I'd actually like a refund, didn't even realize I was charged.;0
Nice polished but useless. There is no filter for tags. Web and app synch problems happens missing tasks. Not any scoring system. May good for amateurs but not for project managers. However I like the calendar view.;0
There are certain things I love like the fact that it sorts my grocery list by aisle automatically. But overall this app stresses me out. I just want an app that allows me to share my grocery list. But the grocery list seems buried in an area that isn't intuitive. I don't need something to schedule every second of my life which seems to be more this apps aim.;0
You reaaallllyyy don't have a lot without paying;0
Can't add more than 5 task to calendar without monthly fee.;0
The design is nice but it doesn't understand when I said 'later'. When I said remind me tomorrow morning, it replied okay I'll be reminded tomorrow at 16:00+. That's afternoon. I'll be very well roasted by my boss by then. Can't find any help on these issues. Was close to confirming my subscription. Sad ☹️;0
Premium version only;0
Is there no way to assign a specific color to an event? I like to group my meetings by color. If I can't do that, the app isn't useful for me.;0
Trying to set a reoccuring event changes the date to one day before what I set it as. Trying to change the date back just creates a second event. Then trying to delete both events takes several tries, because half the time they don't actually delete. This is really annoying.;0
Weak and underdeveloped platform. Don't expect support to treat you like a person - this is a company that just wants your money and then to forget about you.;0
Recurring tasks are very glitchy - they sometimes change the day or time when they recur. Per any.do's request i sent them a video of this happening... crickets. No explanation or acknowledgement and no refund as i requested. Fine otherwise, but i rely on recurring items.;0
Missing grocery list widget and quantity for grocery list items!!!;0
It doesn't sync up with Google Tasks. Not worth the change. Zapier does not work for Android. Zapier only works if you pay the Premium fee plus it only gives the option to add new tasks and complete tasks when integrating with Google Tasks. It does not import current tasks previously created in Google Tasks. There is no way to transfer my 144 tasks from Google to Anydo. And I can't afford $72.00 right off the bat to do it.;0
"NEW: Great concept but NOT for confidential data because it's not encrypted (nor PW protected on phone or PC) and, one day, Any.Do company will get hacked & ALL your stuff be be out there, like EquiFax. RESOLVED: App loses your work. eg: I created a new task, started a ""notes"" section, pasted it in some material and clicked save. Then I went to another app to get more material but when I returned to any.do, my notes were GONE!. Your ""save"" button is fraudulent if it does not save when clicked!";0
Nested can be improved;0
It's a fine app but logs me out every other time I go to use it.;0
Hi Developer. Need to improve note module. It fix only for protrait view, which is when I'm using landscape view (tablet with keyboard), I need to adjust my head or the gadget. TQ;0
Recurring tasks are behind a pay wall. Ridiculous to have to pay a monthly subscription for such a simple feature App is a little ugly and not customisable.;0
Themes and location based reminders are under subscription. Both are free on most of apps like this. Thanks but no. I'll pass and keep using Google keep;0
Not so great. The user interface is not friendly. Making the to do list takes far too long and theres no way (that i found) to make a list that repeats daily. I'll just stick to google keep.;0
Strange thing. When I mark recurrent tasks as done in web desktop version into the Upcoming section.;0
Notification is now pathetic.. shame. I liked it a lot. I think its time to jump ship. It's been fun.;0
After all this time you still can not search tasks on Android. So you have to look through every task you have created and through each list to find what task you are looking for. Going down to 2 star.;0
Not free;0
muito limitador pra quem não paga pra usa, e nem é tão vom assim.;0
It used to be a slick, minimal app that did what it needed to. Then they kept adding layers of unneeded features and forced people to make an account just to use it. No thanks.;0
No monthly recurring reminder features. Can't even remind me when to pay the bills!;0
Have to create an account just to check out functionality. Don't want to do that. Uninstalling.;0
How do i unsubscribe this useless app?;0
List feature sucks! I don't need to manage myself so I can't speak to that functionality. I just wanted a list app, preferably one that worked with Google Assistant. Although that feature works great, the list feature kind of sucks. In an attempt to look new and edgy, the user experience went down the drain. I found it clunky & irritating. I shouldn't have to add a new item to the grocery list just to be able to uncheck items I need again. And that's just one of many irritations. AnyList baby!;0
Great tool. I use it every day. There's a bug, however, that's very annoying. I'm on Galaxy Note 9. When I move the items, there's 80% chance the item will loose previously assigned datetime and will be moved to the Someday list. It's very annoying and time consuming! This is the sorting mode by Time. Additionally, when I choose this mode, majority of items belonging to various lists, unfortunately, will not be sorted by date & time, so I'd have to move them manually... Please fix these issues;1
I'm trying to use this a family organiser and so far so good. The only feature I'd really like is to share reminders - is that possible? E.g. if I set a task in a shared list, I'd like everyone to receive a reminder for that task (or at least the person who has been assigned). As it stands, you can only set up reminders for yourself.;1
Love the app, but frequent changes to the UX are frustrating. I manage to get used to changes, develop some muscle memory, and more changes come. The new snoozing experience is very slow! It may be flashy, but it's just painfully slow, it's an added inconvenience. Please at least make it an opt-in feature.;1
Honestly, needs a lot more features for me to be worth paying premium for (I tried out the free trial). The deal breaker for me was the fact that I can't set custom alerts for calender events.. maximum I can do is 2 days before event.. why can't I customize it (i.e 2 weeks or 10 days)? Then they need other things like automatic dark theme switching. Other than that, it's a nice productivity app. Love that it combines tasks and events into the calendar;1
99% percent love this app! I would like the option to turn off the vibration that occurs when moving a task from one sublist to another. It's annoying to other people nearby when I'm using it in a quiet place which stops me from using it at certain times of my day. Otherwise fulfills all of my to do list and note taking needs.;1
This is my favorite to-do type of app, it's gorgeous on an oled display, but I really wish there were a better way to set up repeatable checklists. To start a good habit I find the reminder to do it everyday very helpfyl, but even better is tracking how many times I actually did after a week and when. This app allows repeat events with notifications but doesn't track time completed or show completed or incomplete events on Cal or Google calendar so making schedule adjustments is a chore.;1
Clean, simple interface. Generally fast and easy to add things as I think of them. However.....I wish the app didn't think it was so smart. I find the auto-spelling annoying. Putting in 8-10 ft. electric cord under lists was automatically interpreted as August 10th. And the assumptions about categories for shopping lists is annoying. 5 different things to get a hardware store end up in 4 different categories. Changing the categories for shopping lists is not easy to manage (and why do they show up under Tasks at all?);1
Great app, very usable, lots of features...but 36$ a year for premium? That's almost as much as I pay for my premium password manager, and that's much more complicated and costly to develop and maintain. This is a GREAT app, but there's no way I'm going to pay that much.;1
Best wunderlist replacement with one major flaw. As far as a to-do list app it is pretty decent and has what you would want. It is very tricky to figure out how to disable all of the random notifications this app sends you. That is my major complaint, but once you finally get it all disabled this app is decent. The layout is a little messy, but the smart grocery grouping is nice.;1
Missing one key feature that is a deal breaker for me. I MUST have the option to create recurring tasks based on date of completion. Ex: If I have a recurring task set up to complete every 10 days, but I actually go 15 days before completing it, I don't want to be reminded again in 5 days. I want the next due date to advance 10 days from whenever I last completed it. It's unfortunate because I love everything about this app, but won't subscribe to the paid version until this feature is added.;1
"It suddenly quit syncing. I've tried logging off and back on again with no luck. When I try to do it manually it just already says that it was synced ""just now""...even though none of the things I have added show up. Never had this problem before. If I can't get it resolved I will remove app and find something different. Very frustrating. Update: I did a FORCE STOP on the app, and it seems to be back to normal. It works for what I need (shopping list) but isn't the easiest for rearranging the list, and the advertisement at the bottom of the list is very annoying and makes rearranging the list even more difficult.";1
Will be happy if this app comes with time duration..other that this is a perfect app with which one can easily create tasks;1
Nearly perfect for daily usage. Is there a way for widget do display tasks hours I think this would be massive help for the users?;1
I LOVE this app. It was the one I narrowed down to after having downloaded several to-do apps. HOWEVER, I wish it had just a plain note taking feature for day to day things to remember, without it being attached to a to-do item. I also wish the interface was slightly easier to manage, there are a couple fixes that would increase the apps ability to be intuitive for the user. (An easier way to undo checking off a list item, being able to view the agendas differently ie calendar and tasks);1
The app felt good enough for me to buy the yearly subscription, which I did and paid th 15€ it requested. But a week later they charged me 17 more euros to my credit card for the same subscription and the same features so I basically paid 32€ . THAT is a scam and unless I get my 17€ euros back I'm gonna keep the rating at one star. Edit: issue was solved and I got a refund for the extra money that was charged, all's well that ends well.;1
Very good planning organizer, but there's still few bugs here and there. In the grocery list, why i can't open the completed lists? It's always close again after 1 second. Please fix.;1
If it wasn't for the fact that the app doesn't offer separate widgets for Work Profile (I personally really need this), I'd give it 5 stars :);1
Its a very good app...the only issue thats what i am facing is the reminder thing..it dont used to send me reminders and it only notify me when the app is opened. However i have already given all the notification rights. Dear any.do team kindly look in to the matter or advise me if i have missed something with respect to notification settings. Thanks;1
Great app for tracking tasks. Could use some work on gesture/finger detection. For example I will always accidentally close the text field for a new note when trying to hit save. Pro version is good but a little pricy for the benefits.;1
I just like this app for it's widget. I didn't pay for the full version so I uninstalled. I'm coming back because the widget look EXACTLY how I need it to look. I wish I could JUST install the widget honestly. It's my favorite.;1
A perfect app to prioritize daily tasks, yet the U.I is still not up to mark.;1
It is great, but it would be better if the sort by Time feature is really sort it by Time. Not only today, tomorrow, and upcoming. It is really inconvenient if in the Upcoming tasks, it is not sort by time.;1
Great app for goal makers, but there are some premium features . Please make them free to use. It's a humble request.;1
Easy to use interface... Premium account links into other APPS;1
Would love to have been able to plan out a week and see it rather than having today, tomorrow, and upcoming. I use the calendar feature a lot, though and it is super useful;1
Great app! It makes my family and me do specific tasks. I would give it a 5 star review but sometimes the notification doesn't pop up at all.;1
I can hardly give up on this app. It is so intuitive even though there are still things to improve. 1-Shortcut to grocery list 2-Displaying time of the task in the widget;1
Easy to use and very straightforward, no fuss just works perfectly with timely reminders.;1
Excellent to help get organized, to dos, lists...havent used all features yet but looking to learn and utilize. U;1
Very good app but I am giving it 4 star because the priorities constantly delete every time I leave the app and suddenly reappear which is very very annoying;1
Its great for quick reminders with events just weird its 30 min before by default i wanna change that alsoo every 3 and 6 months reminder be USEFUL and a must pls like toothbrush replace reminder.;1
So far so good. I just dont like the fact that it has payment to get full features and it's quite expensive.;1
Really useful and well designed app - only thing I feel that is missing to make it five stars is having a shopping list widget;1
So far this is the best app I have used to plan for my hw and studiesas it is very easy to set and plan the things you want .I highly recommend you to try this app.;1
I think that a bug when I set tag for the goal they sometimes disappear;1
Very good app for manage the things. Easy to use.;1
Increase my productivity, helps me to remind, and also the price for premium version is also very less.;1
No pop-up reminders because we use planner as we forget.;1
How to disable the everyday 9am reminder to keep a reminder? Honestly don't need it. That's just a noise!;1
Love this app.. But I wish i can add due date for my task.;1
"Useful app, but with the latest update that incorporates language automatically into setting the time, it will delete times that are part of my reminder. For instance, if I want to say ""go to a meeting at 3:30"" it will delete the words ""at 3:30"" and set the remind to 3:30. So if I wanted my reminder to tell me what time the meeting was, I can't see it anymore. Too bad this option can't be turned off.";1
"Integrates well with my work flow. I had difficulty in understanding the 'My Lists' so instead I ""listed"" My projects instead...works, now integrates well with what I do and the tags differentiates similar project ""lists"". I accidentally deleted my shopping list when I really wanted to remove some items...but its growing on me.";1
Adding Habit Tracker would be useful.;1
This app is good. I use it daily and it runs my life. I have too many tasks though, and anydo's plan my day feature is good at forcing me to postpone stuff to next week, repeatedly. Pls add a built in optional Eisenhower matrix tagging system - tag each item with a quadrant label. Add a matrix view option to view all today's tasks in quadrant view, with filters for specific list only or all items. It's hard work retyping any do items into other apps to view like this;1
UPDATE: Tags have started syncing back again. Tags do not sync between the mobile and desktop app. I am a premium user and I put in a ticket about the issue. After frequent back and forth over the email the issue hasn't been resolved yet. I will update my rating after the issue has been fixed.;1
Simple and useful. Liked the widget too.;1
Only one suggestion: an option for big tasks. Sometimes i have a big task that i will complete over multiple days and it would be cool to be able to check off a little bit at a time.;1
After some recent buggish difficulties, the app functions well. Still, I believe that the widget must become more user-friendly with fewer clicks.;1
I was finally able to get this installed- yay! My husband also put it on his phone so we can share the grocery list and others. I've updated to 4 stars as it seems to be working now. Thanks! Can't get it to finish installing and I have plenty if room. Gets to 97% and then stops. I will revise my review if I ever get to try it!;1
There's no search option for mobile version even I already have the latest version;1
Reminder popups are not displaying at the bottom of my screen on my new Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra. They only appear in the notification area at the top of screen. Is this an Android 10 issue? How do I get the popups again? It worked fine on my Samsung Galaxy S8+;1
Honestly this app is the best todo app i have so far discovered. Im loving the simplicity and Widget of this app. if there's anything missing then it is Timer and habit tracker. i hope you will add those features in near future. so far Great experience.;1
Very good app, it's simple yet you can add layers to your tasks. My only issue is that, you need to pay for some features that are important for executing your tasks.;1
I like to use this app for every day to do list as well as cross device connection. However, to be an ultimate app, you also need to add a habit tracker. It will be awesome.;1
Not always where it should be. does not always popup when set on samsung galaxy 9. very few aps rate 5 stars as very few have no problems at all. 5 stars woould say it works perfectly from my perspective.;1
I have been looking for a calendar app in which I could see, add and edit all my events and tasks in one single window. Wish I had used the app sooner. Nice work!;1
Very good working app. But after knew update every time I open the app it vibrates for clearing off checked todos exactly 12, even though I didn't shake my phone.;1
Just installed this app & it's perfect. UI is really smooth and eye catching. For me widgets are just how I always wanted. One complaint thought. Can 'Any.do' team change the app icon and make it more minimal and good looking ?;1
Are the tasks created in this apo visible in Google calendar? If yes, how to set that up?;1
It was perfect until the new update on Huawei P20 Lite. More precisely with the short cut (widget) on a main screen. Please sort this out. Thanks;1
"Perfect application, great design and useful for all the student exept being obliged to pay to get the ""complete version"" but it still a good app";1
It's very simple to use you can make your list easily and remind your tasks at the moment. Thank's;1
Love the app... But the reminder function is not working well . Otherwise app is awesome . Plz requested to fix it soon;1
Good integration with Google home, but needs widget to be able to access the shopping list;1
Great app but needs work.;1
Widget not working correctly. when updating the date of task to future date, it still shows in today task;1
Awesome app very helpful and does its purpose very well. Just wish it was free or a one time purchase.;1
Good app. Would love an option between 9am and 3pm that I don't have to custom set when I add a reminder. Noon perhaps?;1
I love this app Previous issue of being randomly logged out was resolved;1
Good application, its better if synchronisation time can be improved;1
Nice concept maker's add notification tone's if possible.;1
This platform very good platform Anything planning Just used to any do;1
Relocate the *Delete Task* & *Mark as Done* tabs. I have a Galaxy Note 10+, and, quite likely w/ other phones, when i motion to press my *navigation button* on the bottom right or the *open application button*, on the bottom left, i am frequently accidentally tapping the *mark as done* or *delete task* tabs and have to to manage or recreate my my task details that I was already working with. Aside from being increasingly frustrating, aggravating, and annoying, this becomes a time waster.;1
This could be an awesome app. It has great potential except for a few flaws that end up making it a super irritating app. I have reported these issues to the app's tech support several times only to get lame responses with no resolutions. The latest being that when items are entered into a category in this app, the app for some reason resorts the sequence of items in my list automatically. I put these items in the list in a certain order for a reason. I have other issues, but no moreroomher;1
The grocery lists don't work on Huawei P30 Pro after your last update. The different list sections fold and unfold by themselves. It became impossible to use them. Fix it and I'll give you 5 stars again. Thanks for the follow up, I edit the review to 4 stars by now for the good customer service. Waiting for the big to be fixed!;1
This app is great , I mean really it is.. you can do a lot of things but only if you pay which isn't a bad thing , it's just that as a student adding this to my expenses is just not feasible ... Hence the 4 stars , connecting to a student service such as UniDays would increase influx of student users.;1
Nice app which reminds us our tasks and events;1
I love the app, 8have been usinfg it for quit a while now, the only thing I font like is that it only has a list option, though I wish to make a morning routine on it, please see this and fix it, thank you!;1
Helpfull apps but it would be great if there is search feature;1
Long time user of this app, problem is it doesn't have a search feature. Or if it does I can't find it. Sometimes I forget where I filed my note or task (again longtime user) and then it takes me a while to go through all my files to figure out which title heading I put it under, but if it had a search feature I could quickly find it and get back to being productive. For this reason I gave it 4 stars because it has room for improvement.;1
Excellent app and honestly my life would be so disorganised without it. Really helps me to stay on track. My only request would be to give me greater control over when events repeat than the current setup of every day, week, 2 weeks, etc. (E.g. Allow me to repeat events on weekdays or even better specific days. Like Mondays and Wednesdays for instance.) Otherwise the app is sublime. If this small detail is added then I see no reason to withhold my 5 start reading from you. Great app.;1
The ideal task mamager for me! Perfect combination of ability to customize tasks, design and great for team work. Still would be better if tasks added to My lists wouldn't automatically add to all tasks where Today, Tomorrow etc sections are. Sometimes I need them to keep in my lists and not be added to lists with some time attachment:) If possible, I am your fan forever !;1
Good app, simple, easy, beautiful design, bright colors, auto backup to cloud, sync with calendar, it has two subscribe plans, free account and premium.;1
After testing the app for a while, I was ready to purchase it but read on your user guide that searching for tasks is not available on Android. Do you know when it would be available? Also, is there a one time fee purchase option? Is there a GMAIL integration feature? Like Google Tasks? I like the minimalist simplistic clean look of your app 👍. Nice work on the Widgets 👍. Thanks 🙂;1
I reinstalled 5 times but is'nt working basically It is'nt singing with any of 3 methods. Plese fix It, I am unable to use such a good application.;1
Can anyone explain 'any.do moment' and 'plan my day' option in the app??;1
I used to love this (five stars) before you changed it. I was able to set repeatable tasks for each day of the week, but now if I set a repeating task today, for example, for every Wednesday, the reminder will come up today, not Wednesday. I want the reminder on the day I want. I am very disappointed. By the way, I won't use Any Do for my grocery list. I use a better one that keeps a running cost (including tax) for each store I go to.;1
"Confused. I'm not sure what happened and I'm glad I didn't have a long grocery list because I just had to transfer everything from my ""Grocery List"" to a new one so it would open like a normal list and not as a pop up. I don't understand why y'all thought that was a good idea but whatever. I've clicked everything I can think to click. ""Convert to regular list"" isn't an option that I've seen anywhere. Is that only in premium?";1
Real nice app. I like links to google calendar for events, reminders. Not sure about tasks. Have you guys thought about drag and drop between tasks and events? It'd be perfect for time blocking or scheduling tasks. Right now I use a zapier that takes new tasks in a specific list and lists them as 5 am on today's calendar. I'd like to drag them to certain times so my schedule doesn't fill up (shows time blocks as busy in Calendar). Thanks;1
this app is just simply awesome 👌 just one thing I missed was notification sound, it won't ring when a task is due, as a result I won't be able to know about the task if I ain't using my phone.;1
I really love this app. I find myself wanting to make tasks for myself about it. It has an incredibly clean UI and feels great to use. The only issue I have with it is the pricing model for the pro version. For 5 or 6- admittedly useful- features, there's a monthly subscription. Which personally I find to be ludicrous. I'd willingly pay a one time charge, but a monthly payment is just silly for this app.;1
Would give 5 stars if it wasn't buggy and didn't cause me to miss a task. The calendar widget is a complete failure. It randomly removes some of the calendars that are synced and creates a duplicate of repeated tasks when they are marked as complete. The whole reason I subscribed to this app was because I needed to sync all my calendars and make my life easier by maintaining them all in one place and not miss any appointments or tasks. The app is useless if I can't rely on it to display and sync correctly. Fix the bugs and I'll reinstall and change to 5 stars.;1
I like the ease of creating different to do lists, ability to create subtasks, and that i can make my grocery shopping list according to what store I shop at. It's great that the grocery list are automatically sorted by aisle for you. However, i noticed that if i add a price to the beginning or end of the grocery item, that it gets put in the 'other' aisle category. I also like how you can switch something in one list to a different one just by tapping on it. Nice work 👍;1
As someone with ADHD, organizational tools are a necessity and this is one of the best. I say that having tried just about every well rated organizational app in the app store. That said, this is obviously still in development. The web version is missing many important aspects. However new features are coming out regularly and the team is very responsive. Once a few more features are up to par (namely the website and the smart lists) I'll be changing this to a 5 star reveiw and paying for pro.;1
I love writing notes and to do lists. But this program does not save. I mean, when you write notes in the middle of writing and try forceful close (what happens, if phone crashes in the middle?) and doesn't automatically save. So I'm not really sure, if I want to use it, because I'm afraid I'm going to get lost a lot of my progress. I would like to use it. But for now I will rather have to wait or find another alternative.;1
"One of the best apps there, recursive, monthly check list to do, even with sub-tasks. Good job. I'm giving just 4 stars because notifications are too much, you need to consolidate them in just one expandable and also because ""do later"" or ""done"" pop ups are a little strange, you can check a do later time for first one or something like that but not everything.";1
"It's a GREAT app. 4 Stars because I think one addition would be a way to have 2 identical widgets running without being connected. Like 1 widget set for my daily goals tasks (shower, laundry, gym), and the second widget for tasks I update and add throughout the day (pick up milk, get haircut)! That way i don't get overwhelmed by a single long list but instead have 2 smaller lists. I'm a ""one screen all widgets"" guy. Another addition would possibly be a widget calendar list, instead of having the 30 day calendar + each days events. Seems useless to have such a huge window of calendar days when I really just need to have a list of events of each day. Samsung calendar has this widget and it's perfect.";1
"I love this app! It has helped me become so much more productive and organized. Any time I think, ""I should do ..."" I just add it to my Any.do! [Would rate 5 stars, except I hate that the Upcoming list is automatically bumped up to Today after a period of time, and it also continuously logs me, which is not only cumbersome, but renders the widget useless for that time.]";1
"So far, so good! I've been eyeing this app for quite a long time and I'm pretty satisfied so far! I'd just suggest two features: being able to see completed tasks on the calendar, without them showing up all the time unless you clear all of them! And I'd love to see more features with the tags, like being able to sort tasks by them and putting different ""levels"" on them. For instance, this tag has more priority than the others. Thanks for the hard work!";1
Good app but eventually stopped using it as it didn't fit my needs exactly.;1
Ol;1
I'm trying to use this a family organiser and so far so good. The only feature I'd really like is to share reminders - is that possible? E.g. if I set a task in a shared list, I'd like everyone to receive a reminder for that task (or at least the person who has been assigned). As it stands, you can only set up reminders for yourself.;1
If it wasn't for the fact that the app doesn't offer separate widgets for Work Profile (I personally really need this), I'd give it 5 stars :);1
Will be happy if this app comes with time duration..other that this is a perfect app with which one can easily create tasks;1
I love the app, 8have been usinfg it for quit a while now, the only thing I font like is that it only has a list option, though I wish to make a morning routine on it, please see this and fix it, thank you!;1
It has been very useful for me.;1
Its great for quick reminders with events just weird its 30 min before by default i wanna change that alsoo every 3 and 6 months reminder be USEFUL and a must pls like toothbrush replace reminder.;1
Adding Habit Tracker would be useful.;1
Love the app, but frequent changes to the UX are frustrating. I manage to get used to changes, develop some muscle memory, and more changes come. The new snoozing experience is very slow! It may be flashy, but it's just painfully slow, it's an added inconvenience. Please at least make it an opt-in feature.;1
This is my favorite to-do type of app, it's gorgeous on an oled display, but I really wish there were a better way to set up repeatable checklists. To start a good habit I find the reminder to do it everyday very helpfyl, but even better is tracking how many times I actually did after a week and when. This app allows repeat events with notifications but doesn't track time completed or show completed or incomplete events on Cal or Google calendar so making schedule adjustments is a chore.;1
Easy to use interface... Premium account links into other APPS;1
Relocate the *Delete Task* & *Mark as Done* tabs. I have a Galaxy Note 10+, and, quite likely w/ other phones, when i motion to press my *navigation button* on the bottom right or the *open application button*, on the bottom left, i am frequently accidentally tapping the *mark as done* or *delete task* tabs and have to to manage or recreate my my task details that I was already working with. Aside from being increasingly frustrating, aggravating, and annoying, this becomes a time waster.;1
Honestly, needs a lot more features for me to be worth paying premium for (I tried out the free trial). The deal breaker for me was the fact that I can't set custom alerts for calender events.. maximum I can do is 2 days before event.. why can't I customize it (i.e 2 weeks or 10 days)? Then they need other things like automatic dark theme switching. Other than that, it's a nice productivity app. Love that it combines tasks and events into the calendar;1
Nearly perfect for daily usage. Is there a way for widget do display tasks hours I think this would be massive help for the users?;1
Clean, simple interface. Generally fast and easy to add things as I think of them. However.....I wish the app didn't think it was so smart. I find the auto-spelling annoying. Putting in 8-10 ft. electric cord under lists was automatically interpreted as August 10th. And the assumptions about categories for shopping lists is annoying. 5 different things to get a hardware store end up in 4 different categories. Changing the categories for shopping lists is not easy to manage (and why do they show up under Tasks at all?);1
A perfect app to prioritize daily tasks, yet the U.I is still not up to mark.;1
99% percent love this app! I would like the option to turn off the vibration that occurs when moving a task from one sublist to another. It's annoying to other people nearby when I'm using it in a quiet place which stops me from using it at certain times of my day. Otherwise fulfills all of my to do list and note taking needs.;1
Great tool. I use it every day. There's a bug, however, that's very annoying. I'm on Galaxy Note 9. When I move the items, there's 80% chance the item will loose previously assigned datetime and will be moved to the Someday list. It's very annoying and time consuming! This is the sorting mode by Time. Additionally, when I choose this mode, majority of items belonging to various lists, unfortunately, will not be sorted by date & time, so I'd have to move them manually... Please fix these issues;1
Nice app foe reminder;1
Great app, very usable, lots of features...but 36$ a year for premium? That's almost as much as I pay for my premium password manager, and that's much more complicated and costly to develop and maintain. This is a GREAT app, but there's no way I'm going to pay that much.;1
Nice app very useful;1
Nice;1
Easy to use and very straightforward, no fuss just works perfectly with timely reminders.;1
Helpful app. Thanks for the good work.;1
Any.do is gradually becoming my daily tool for managing my schedule, tracking customer debt position. It is a rewarding experience for d money.;1
I reinstalled 5 times but is'nt working basically It is'nt singing with any of 3 methods. Plese fix It, I am unable to use such a good application.;1
The app lacks tools to view how good I am keeping up with my daily habit/recurring tasks.;1
Very good planning organizer, but there's still few bugs here and there. In the grocery list, why i can't open the completed lists? It's always close again after 1 second. Please fix.;1
Very nice;1
Great app but needs work.;1
Best wunderlist replacement with one major flaw. As far as a to-do list app it is pretty decent and has what you would want. It is very tricky to figure out how to disable all of the random notifications this app sends you. That is my major complaint, but once you finally get it all disabled this app is decent. The layout is a little messy, but the smart grocery grouping is nice.;1
This app is great , I mean really it is.. you can do a lot of things but only if you pay which isn't a bad thing , it's just that as a student adding this to my expenses is just not feasible ... Hence the 4 stars , connecting to a student service such as UniDays would increase influx of student users.;1
Goood;1
Good;1
There's no search option for mobile version even I already have the latest version;1
So far so good. I just dont like the fact that it has payment to get full features and it's quite expensive.;1
Great;1
Great app for tracking tasks. Could use some work on gesture/finger detection. For example I will always accidentally close the text field for a new note when trying to hit save. Pro version is good but a little pricy for the benefits.;1
Its a very good app...the only issue thats what i am facing is the reminder thing..it dont used to send me reminders and it only notify me when the app is opened. However i have already given all the notification rights. Dear any.do team kindly look in to the matter or advise me if i have missed something with respect to notification settings. Thanks;1
Good note;1
It is great, but it would be better if the sort by Time feature is really sort it by Time. Not only today, tomorrow, and upcoming. It is really inconvenient if in the Upcoming tasks, it is not sort by time.;1
So far this is the best app I have used to plan for my hw and studiesas it is very easy to set and plan the things you want .I highly recommend you to try this app.;1
"It suddenly quit syncing. I've tried logging off and back on again with no luck. When I try to do it manually it just already says that it was synced ""just now""...even though none of the things I have added show up. Never had this problem before. If I can't get it resolved I will remove app and find something different. Very frustrating. Update: I did a FORCE STOP on the app, and it seems to be back to normal. It works for what I need (shopping list) but isn't the easiest for rearranging the list, and the advertisement at the bottom of the list is very annoying and makes rearranging the list even more difficult.";1
This app really help me.😊;1
How to disable the everyday 9am reminder to keep a reminder? Honestly don't need it. That's just a noise!;1
No pop-up reminders because we use planner as we forget.;1
The grocery lists don't work on Huawei P30 Pro after your last update. The different list sections fold and unfold by themselves. It became impossible to use them. Fix it and I'll give you 5 stars again. Thanks for the follow up, I edit the review to 4 stars by now for the good customer service. Waiting for the big to be fixed!;1
Increase my productivity, helps me to remind, and also the price for premium version is also very less.;1
It helped me;1
I LOVE this app. It was the one I narrowed down to after having downloaded several to-do apps. HOWEVER, I wish it had just a plain note taking feature for day to day things to remember, without it being attached to a to-do item. I also wish the interface was slightly easier to manage, there are a couple fixes that would increase the apps ability to be intuitive for the user. (An easier way to undo checking off a list item, being able to view the agendas differently ie calendar and tasks);1
Love this app.. But I wish i can add due date for my task.;1
Très pratique !;1
Are the tasks created in this apo visible in Google calendar? If yes, how to set that up?;1
Very good app for manage the things. Easy to use.;1
I can hardly give up on this app. It is so intuitive even though there are still things to improve. 1-Shortcut to grocery list 2-Displaying time of the task in the widget;1
Its good and does the job;1
I started with the subscription primarily because of the NLP. Does it support recurring tasks with NLP ? The integrations are awsome!;1
Great app for goal makers, but there are some premium features . Please make them free to use. It's a humble request.;1
Subscribe by hi iam vimal;1
Good;1
Had an issue but it was handled right away.;1
Great;1
Great App for planning my day;1
It's simply the best 😁 ❤️;1
Missing one key feature that is a deal breaker for me. I MUST have the option to create recurring tasks based on date of completion. Ex: If I have a recurring task set up to complete every 10 days, but I actually go 15 days before completing it, I don't want to be reminded again in 5 days. I want the next due date to advance 10 days from whenever I last completed it. It's unfortunate because I love everything about this app, but won't subscribe to the paid version until this feature is added.;1
I just like this app for it's widget. I didn't pay for the full version so I uninstalled. I'm coming back because the widget look EXACTLY how I need it to look. I wish I could JUST install the widget honestly. It's my favorite.;1
Really useful and well designed app - only thing I feel that is missing to make it five stars is having a shopping list widget;1
Do i need to pay?;1
Great app! It makes my family and me do specific tasks. I would give it a 5 star review but sometimes the notification doesn't pop up at all.;1
Very good app but I am giving it 4 star because the priorities constantly delete every time I leave the app and suddenly reappear which is very very annoying;1
I m new to used;1
I think that a bug when I set tag for the goal they sometimes disappear;1
Nice;1
Timely;1
Excellent to help get organized, to dos, lists...havent used all features yet but looking to learn and utilize. U;1
Simple and useful. Liked the widget too.;1
Good app, simple, easy, beautiful design, bright colors, auto backup to cloud, sync with calendar, it has two subscribe plans, free account and premium.;1
Good;1
The app felt good enough for me to buy the yearly subscription, which I did and paid th 15€ it requested. But a week later they charged me 17 more euros to my credit card for the same subscription and the same features so I basically paid 32€ . THAT is a scam and unless I get my 17€ euros back I'm gonna keep the rating at one star. Edit: issue was solved and I got a refund for the extra money that was charged, all's well that ends well.;1
Would love to have been able to plan out a week and see it rather than having today, tomorrow, and upcoming. I use the calendar feature a lot, though and it is super useful;1
This app is good. I use it daily and it runs my life. I have too many tasks though, and anydo's plan my day feature is good at forcing me to postpone stuff to next week, repeatedly. Pls add a built in optional Eisenhower matrix tagging system - tag each item with a quadrant label. Add a matrix view option to view all today's tasks in quadrant view, with filters for specific list only or all items. It's hard work retyping any do items into other apps to view like this;1
Very practical and usefull application;1
Nice app which reminds us our tasks and events;1
I like thid;1
Super;1
Good;1
Useful;1
Boo.;1
After some recent buggish difficulties, the app functions well. Still, I believe that the widget must become more user-friendly with fewer clicks.;1
This could be an awesome app. It has great potential except for a few flaws that end up making it a super irritating app. I have reported these issues to the app's tech support several times only to get lame responses with no resolutions. The latest being that when items are entered into a category in this app, the app for some reason resorts the sequence of items in my list automatically. I put these items in the list in a certain order for a reason. I have other issues, but no moreroomher;1
Helpful 😁;1
"Useful app, but with the latest update that incorporates language automatically into setting the time, it will delete times that are part of my reminder. For instance, if I want to say ""go to a meeting at 3:30"" it will delete the words ""at 3:30"" and set the remind to 3:30. So if I wanted my reminder to tell me what time the meeting was, I can't see it anymore. Too bad this option can't be turned off.";1
Can anyone explain 'any.do moment' and 'plan my day' option in the app??;1
UPDATE: Tags have started syncing back again. Tags do not sync between the mobile and desktop app. I am a premium user and I put in a ticket about the issue. After frequent back and forth over the email the issue hasn't been resolved yet. I will update my rating after the issue has been fixed.;1
"Integrates well with my work flow. I had difficulty in understanding the 'My Lists' so instead I ""listed"" My projects instead...works, now integrates well with what I do and the tags differentiates similar project ""lists"". I accidentally deleted my shopping list when I really wanted to remove some items...but its growing on me.";1
Is this a free app or have to subscribe (& pay) to use beyond 7 days?;1
Only one suggestion: an option for big tasks. Sometimes i have a big task that i will complete over multiple days and it would be cool to be able to check off a little bit at a time.;1
this is a good app;1
Great.. and i liked it more than todoist..;1
I purchased premium almost immediately, as this is exactly what I've been looking for - simple to-do lists. Can repeat tasks, can set reminders, can add subtasks, can colour code, can sync with calendar, can have several lists - or can just ignore all that and use a simple dump-it-all perpetually ongoing to-do list. Love it. Can also use it from desktop on any OS (web interface), and it syncs quickly. There's a light mode with several colours available, and also night mode with a black background. Separately I would like to mention customer service. I was stuck in another country due to the pandemic, and my card got blocked. My bank took its blissful time to reissue and send a new card to me - meanwhile, all my subscriptions and bills bounced. I got a billing issue notification. I replied, explaining my situation, and any.do was very kind to provide a month of premium usage for free. Priority support replies are very prompt. The agent I was in contact with (Tali) is polite and quick. Overall, this app is a keeper. Finally a todo app that I use - because it doesn't annoy me.;1
Best app for replacing Wunderlist. Love the plan my day and the many integrations. So good, I even paid for the premium version (& I never pay for apps). You can get by without it, but it's so worth it. I'm so much more productive with this to do app and the way it is set up saves me so much time when I'm checking my to do list, planning my day's schedule and planning my goals for the week. 😍 Also.... Thank you to the developer for adding the rich search feature!;1
This is my favourite personal todo apps after going through so many to-do apps. I like the calendar view that link with Google calendar. All events can be added direct in the apps. I use this apps calendar view a lot. They improve a lot from time to time especially recently with the natural language which make me even more productive. Like the web app as well. The support they give when facing issue also very professional. It sure a 5 stars apps that suit my needs.;1
I really like this app, it helps me organize my tasks and replace my to-do list (that needs writing). This app is really simple and great. You can organize your tasks anytime and anywhere by downloading this app!!;1
I like it. It allows me to have my tasks and google calendar all in one place in my mobile. Google doesn't offer this at the moment. I think the yearly fee is a little too much though.;1
Be careful with this app. They will give free trail for few days and collect your card details. They will deduct the amount after trail period without informing you. I am struggling now, how to invoke the amount.;1
Wow! I love how well it integrates with Google's Home products. Verbally adding items to my various to do lists as well as my grocery list is awesome!!;1
the best so far! I'm having a difficulty in remembering things to do. With this app, it reminds what are the things that needs to be done for today, tomorrow and to some other day.;1
I love this app. Super friendly and intuitive. I would like to see better integration to desktop web browsers, but the phone so experience is excellent.;1
Really amazing app. I am using a paid version to integrate some apps but even the unpaid version is also amazing. Few more features required that i already sent to your support team.;1
A multitude of options available to style your own planner/to-do list. Give it a try, and I'll bet you like it!;1
Great app. I like how I can rearrange the list easily. Also the someday, upcoming and tomorrow categories are just what I need when something spring's to mind.;1
The best to do app on the market The free version is just perfect, no annoying ads and no missing features. The paid version is just as amazing, super cheap, super fast to use, every action is optimized, and the whole experience is great. I have a really hard time with my daily task and this app is a blessing. Helped me like nothing else. Also it syncs with calendar and computer which is greatly appreciated.;1
There's nothing you can find fault with this app. So useful and user friendly. It's worth more than 5-star;1
Love it! After the last 1 1/2 months of trying both Any.do and Microsoft To Do, I have finally settled on my Wunderlist replacement. Any.do is the winner by a landslide. I love the clean look, the ease of use, and the interface with my calendar. But once the search feature was added, that secured Any.do as the clear choice.;1
Neat design, intuitive and helpful to organize your time if you need a constant reminder not to procrastinate (like I do😬);1
After a lot of non suitable planners, finally found the best one. Compatible with most apps.;1
Honestly love this task making app. Fantastic interface. Very pleased with the level of customisation for each task, as well as the ease of delegation via invitation/tagging on the app itself. They basically provide you with enough tools to actually take them up on their request for a rating in the Play Store. Well deserved 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟;1
I've tried so many different To do list and planning apps, but this is by far the best one. Easy to use, straight forward, and I love how it reminds you on Screen of what you have to do instead of just in the notification bar like most other apps do. Would highly recommend it, the free version is remarkable, but I got the paid version mainly to support the developers.;1
Love it!! It's exactly what I was looking for! A suggestion: Would like to be able to add a birthday on Any.do. I always forget people's birthdays and was looking for a list on which I can add birthdays on Any.do. I don't have birthdays on my contacts - only realised it's there when I read about it on Any.do. Thank you for a excellent App!;1
"I like this app! Nice to see your tasks and calendar invites in the same place. The ""plan your day"" feature is nice. I like that you can also access your to-do lists on desktop.";1
I didn't realise how useful this would become, I've now got my teenager on it so zero excuses! It's pleasant to use, easy navigation and having it linked to Alexa is great. I'm using it for work, study and home life. If you can, get the premium version, it makes a helluva difference.;1
For anyone with Adhd, this app is like hitting the jackpot! Simple (can't over complicate things) but very powerful. The 'Focus' function allows me to prevent distractions on my phone and see what I was working on if I am distracted hy something else, keeping me in task. It's ability to integrate/sync with almost anything allows me to add a task or event to whatever is immediately available before I forget. Only suggestion is ability to add contact to events/tasks.;1
Excellent I rarely rate apps but this is a masterpiece. I've been looking for an app for reminders for quite a while, and eventually found this. It does much more. Pretty amazing.;1
İ am a business owner in Azerbaijan, so my employees are not used to using alot of technology yet. I tried using other apps but they were to complicated for my team. But Any.do is really easy to use and less complicated. We use it as personal organiser but also as a company coworking platform. Really great app that i can recommend to small and medium size businesses, but u can also use it as a personal organiser. Also it is great that this app has many different language portals;1
It's an awesome app. Helps me to be organized daily and is very simple to use.;1
I have used it daily for over a year. It helps me be more efficient by not forgetting things I need to do or pick up at the office, the store, or for work projects. It also saves your lists on their server so if you lose your phone, your work is not lost. Highly recommended.;1
It's very good application for organising our works and tasks in day to day life which are very important in order to enhance our productivity and progress. The application has almost all the features and facilities to cover the tasks and other relevant details. Thanks to the developer of the application.;1
After having used several to do application, this is certainly the perfect one! They even have WhatsApp reminders, a desktop app, there's never anything you'll miss with it. Been using it for more than a year now and it's helped put so many priorities in place!;1
It's a great app.. but pricing could be a little lower.;1
very smooth and elegant. works perfect as your daily planner;1
I thought it was great, i had no problems at all and i have no complaints about the app at all. I havent experienced any of the difficulties that others have aparantly had. Thanks for this great app!;1
Great app !!! Really helps to keep track of all ideas, plans, goals and things to do in general.;1
I use the free version of the app and it lets me build to do list. It also has features where you can build multiple lists, I especially like the shopping list feature, it uses auto suggestion which is very helpful.;1
Such a great app. Helps to organize your day perfectly. Great features;1
Easy! Make your to-do list. Check it off or move it. What else do you want in a to-do app?;1
After trying the whole todo in market, I got back to any. do. I feel the reason of getting back to it is its calm, neat and wonderful user interface. It's quite friendly. The interactive elements are very thoughtfully designed. 🔥;1
A must app for your phone! I have a monthly view widget in my home home screen with 100% transparent. It's make a clean view of my hoemscreen. No invasive notifications pop-ups. Like the New Task /New Event Tabs at the bottom of the widget. Full recommended!;1
This is the best to-do app ever. It really helps me keep track of what all i need to do. Due to a busy schedule, it becomes difficult to remember all my tasks. Thanks to this app, i don't need to remember my tasks.;1
Helps a lot in reminding of tasks to be done on daily basis.;1
I use this as a list maker. Using free version. I really like how it let's me organize and that I can sync it with my computer and Alexa.;1
Nice reminder app. Easy to use and categorise tasks 🙂👍🏼;1
Helps me stay focused on doing what I need to do. The more I use it, the more I learn how to maximize its effectiveness, especially by accessing features I previously ignored.;1
Awesome app. I love how detailed it is. The only other thing I can think of right now is to be able to talk to it and have it help you put what you want in the best place;1
Very positive easy to interface with and helpful all the way around. I appreciate how simple it is to integrate this into my daily scheduling.;1
Great interface and easy to use unlike other productivity apps. I'd suggest to go for the premium features as they're worth the price;1
The best to-do program I've ever used. Clean, minimal interface & scheduling tasks.;1
It's a great app especially for entrepreneurs who have too many scheduled meetings in a day or for students who get a lot of homework or have to do a lot of studies in a day;1
The app assist me by reminding me to complete my task. It is helpful and allows me to do all my work on time without missing any important events.;1
What an amazing app!)) Great functionality, easy to use, and improving with every update. Highly recommend !!);1
Brilliant. It has a flow and ease of use that just clicks with the way my mind works. Best app ever 🙌👌;1
Its just perfect. And the best, no adds at all in the basic version!;1
Perfect app for maintaining and reviewing tasks. Also loved the look and feel of the app. No adds which is amazing.;1
It does exactly what I need it to do. Calendar, to do lists, schedules. No problems, just easy.;1
Really like the app, going to switch to the paid version soon. Helped me so much with planning my days!;1
I have a terrible memory and this app has been a life saver. I wish it could link with my google home mini so I can ask it directly what reminders I have;1
"This application is very helpful for me. Thanks ""Any.do"" for everything to remember me.";1
Simple to use, easy to make categories, tasks, sub tasks, reminders etc;1
Good app for reminders and such. Used for years.;1
One of d best apps that I came across.. it's easy to use and very effective.. helps a lot for someone like me who needs constant reminders 😄;1
The way it organizes your grocery list is awesome and very helpful when you're at the store.;1
Works very well for me. Very helpful because I can see what I prioritized for work and for my business days before.;1
Superb app Its gets behind you and makes sure you complete the tasks. Really beneficial if you are forgetting the tasks and unable keep a tab on those tasks;1
Great App for productivity .. Pretty straight forward too;1
Really convenient, helpful features, sleek and smooth OS and very user-friendly. 5/5 recommendation 👌🏻♥️;1
I really enjoy this app.its v simple to use and never let's me down with keeping on top my day to day reminders.;1
the only thing that is really lacking with this app is an option to choose time digitally , instead of choosing it anlogue way;1
Very good app and great integration across platforms (ios, android, pc).;1
I like this app, finding it very helpful with day to day tasks!;1
Hello. IT is a good App 👍 better than what I have used before. Thanks. I look forward to seeing your next development of this app. BB;1
Fantastic little organiser. Sleek, simple and intuitive.;1
I love how it integrated into my calendar and all the different features it offers while having a clean UI. Thanks Any.do Team!!;1
The feature to add 'someday' tasks on android widget is missing and would be helpful to have;1
Very happy that search is available on Android version now!;1
I use it all the time and it syncs with voice assistants;1
Very helpful more so than any other to do app. Love the reminders.;1
Pretty great all around app. Ability to whattsap a task to my list is brilliant!;1
Love it.bim very forgetful and thus app has saved my life! Easy to use and in point! 😀;1
Ease of use. Everything at your fingertips. Even I can't forget something.;1
Best app for remainders. It would better to have date for task list under upcoming category in the widget;1
Super reminder app. Snoozing option is the best option. I like it. Short and sweet snoozing option.;1
Clean and Tidy. One of the best applications to schedule your appointments/activities everyday.;1
Easy to use really and the integration with google calendar is awesome.;1
Easy to use, I only use it for the to do list but its perfect.;1
I forget to do a lot of things i think of during the day, Any.do. is an excellent way to remind me. Just set an alarm, and it will remind you. Even if its something days away.. .I highly recommend it to everyone.. even if your not forgetful..;1
Easy to use - Effective - Among best apps I've ever downloaded. Thanks.;1
Elevates your productivity. Very neat and organized app;1
Better than To Do, love the calendar function I could do without the frills and animations, though;1
The WhatsApp feature is exceptional. This App has changed my life.;1

The app, Not just working ok, but, its a great one...;1
Cool interface and easy navigation.;1
Nice app. I'll give 5 stars for this app. It really helps me to be a productive person everyday!;1
it's a very good app I like how the to do list is categorized.;1
Excellent to do app. Very convenient & easy to use.;1
Difficult to use, so much ads;1
This is very good apps 👍;1
Keeps me organized at work. Only complaint is sometimes my pics dont upload;1
I love this app. Only thing I would add is something like how Samsung calendar gives notifications for events /reminders by taking up the whole screen. Sometimes I miss the notifications;1
Best app for organization;1
One of the best apps I've ever owned. Genuinely does what it's supposed to do and that's making your life easier. It's truly amazing kudos to the development team❤️;1
Beautiful app for organised working and nice reminder;1
I've tried many to-do apps over the last 5 or so years and I like AnyDo the best, especially the ability to snooze to a particular day and time. I use this app everyday.;1
Excellent;1
Best and greate job;1
Great app;1
Thanks for giving free uc;1
Wow! I love how well it integrates with Google's Home products. Verbally adding items to my various to do lists as well as my grocery list is awesome!!;1
Very bad;1
Nice reminder app. Easy to use and categorise tasks 🙂👍🏼;1
Great app!;1
This app is too good;1

Very productive app;1
Helps a lot in reminding of tasks to be done on daily basis.;1
Fantastic app keeps me on track daily;1
Really awesome app.;1
Best app for replacing Wunderlist. Love the plan my day and the many integrations. So good, I even paid for the premium version (& I never pay for apps). You can get by without it, but it's so worth it. I'm so much more productive with this to do app and the way it is set up saves me so much time when I'm checking my to do list, planning my day's schedule and planning my goals for the week. 😍 Also.... Thank you to the developer for adding the rich search feature!;1
Great app to organise your day;1
The best reminder app i've used;1
Good organizer;1
Excellent;1
World best app;1
Learning to use this app is easy 👏;1
Wonder full;1
I really like this app, it helps me organize my tasks and replace my to-do list (that needs writing). This app is really simple and great. You can organize your tasks anytime and anywhere by downloading this app!!;1
Good app for reminders and such. Used for years.;1
BEST TO DO LIST EVAAAA!!!!!!;1
The WhatsApp feature is exceptional. This App has changed my life.;1
One of the best;1
Great app;1
La migliore app per todolist;1
This is my favourite personal todo apps after going through so many to-do apps. I like the calendar view that link with Google calendar. All events can be added direct in the apps. I use this apps calendar view a lot. They improve a lot from time to time especially recently with the natural language which make me even more productive. Like the web app as well. The support they give when facing issue also very professional. It sure a 5 stars apps that suit my needs.;1
Superr;1
Easy and simple.;1
Great;1
I just love it ♡♡♡♡♡♡;1
A multitude of options available to style your own planner/to-do list. Give it a try, and I'll bet you like it!;1
very smooth and elegant. works perfect as your daily planner;1
Greatest;1

Handy app keeps me organised and on track with jobs;1
Highly recommended. I have never had a problem. Easy to use. No ads. I love it.;1
Ótimo para agendar tudo o que tem que fazer no dia! Muito bom para quem gosta de se organizar em tudo!;1
Really nice to use!;1

Es muy practitica y fácil de usar;1
Ease of use. Everything at your fingertips. Even I can't forget something.;1
Great app! And customer support is very helpful and quick to respond!;1
Helped me a lot so far;1
Samim;1
Excellent;1
Be careful with this app. They will give free trail for few days and collect your card details. They will deduct the amount after trail period without informing you. I am struggling now, how to invoke the amount.;1
"Money-grubbing app that charges ""premium price"" for features that other apps offer for free. I don't see a single feature that would justify spending 4 bucks a month on it. Ad supported is better than this slick dump - at least you pay just once to remove the ads and then you can enjoy your app. That being said, just writing your list out and crossing stuff off is preferable to this with no monthly charge to do it";0
Way too expensive for the premium features. While I don't mind paying for an app there are many other apps that track to-do items for far less money;0
Poor support response or lack thereof. You can't fully delete a history so I had to create a new account. Been waiting 12 days for support to transfer my licence over. Have followed up and still no response. Very disappointing. Ref no 507634;0
Sends mails claiming monthly payments of $4 without yearly commitment but monthly without yearly commitment costs $7 And also the app is quite crappy without premium, and premium at $4 would still be too expensive for what you get.;0
App not starting on my Xiaomi Mi 9 SE, Miui global 11.0.6. Just a black screen. The chrome app does work (clicked on add to home screen from the website) but I really wanted to use the widget. Very disappointing;0
I just installed the app and ran it to see how I liked it. For my taste, way too crowded UI. Then, I started receiving email notifications at least once a day about a task it automatically creates for the user, which is to add a task. I was annoyed so I uninstalled it. The email notifications continued. I had to manually unsubscribe from receiving email notifications about a task I never created from an app I am not using. Unjustifiable behavior!;0
"Now you can't even see the *today's* completed tasks without paying premium? Seems like ""how much inconvenience can we cause to the users to force them to pay before they abandon the app?"" This is a todo list. It's not like you've solved a new problem, produce content, or provide any significant service. Response/edit: currently, you can only see by project or subtasks, but not by today's tasks. Seeing today's completed tasks is the bare minimum to observe your progress throughout the day.";0
glad i only selected 1 month. they try too much to make a sleek design, that its counter intuitive, especially for repeating tasks.;0
Everything is a premium feature. Everything else is a basic list;0
Basic features such as reminders and labels need an upgrade. And it costs 3200+ rupees in India. That's how much we pay for an entire year's electricity bill or groceries for a whole month! Way too expensive for such basic features. NKT WORTH IT! USELESS APP!;0
The company has removed the feature that elevated the tool from others completely unannounced. Without it it's just a list tool with inconvenient UX, limited possibilities of organizing your tasks, absolutely useless and badly calculated karma and overpriced premium. Would not recommend to anybody - there are tons of better tools.;0
Reminders are a premium feature, which is what I needed this app for. It really sucks that I can't use reminders for free. I have to continue the search for a good reminders app.;0
Can I rate it zero? I spent time explaining support that new widget doesn't follow anymore default /system android theme. Before this ridiculous widget update it followed it and switched to dark mode automatically. Nothing fixed and only meaningless questions from, most likely, outsourced support is all I got. Note 10 Plus/Android 10/June security patch EDIT I do not use any custom launcher. Running stock firmware, totally;0
You literally have to buy premium for it to remind you. Like that defies the purpose of the app. Just go use Tick Tick instead. Its free version has more features than this Todoist's premium version.;0
The old navigation was better, especially on desktop. I miss being able to edit directly, now I have to go through more steps.;0
The smart schedule feature was removed without notice. Until that's fixed to me, the app is like any other to-do app, I've started to look elsewhere;0
i bought full premium version for lifetime in 2016 and didn't use much at that time. Now it says i have free plan and wants me to pay again for upgrade... please help;0
reminders are premium features now, means app is completely useless. need to search for an alternative that can migrate tasks now... great 🙄;0
I deleted this app and it still sends me emails everyday! Its a waist of time anyway;0
Reminders feature behind in app purchase. Seriously? Thats the most basic function of to do list. No way im going to pay you monthly just for reminders;0
Reminder is a paid feature and the premium version is too costly.;0
Without paid membership there was no use of this app.. so guys don't download it.;0
Anything beyond keeping a simple list (including reminders) is paid;0
Subscription for reminders $5. Well it's fine I will move to Google Tasks.;0
, every time I put a task in it removed the number in the name and put it in my inbox.... Why???;0
Really difficult app to use. Loads of problems and shortcomings. For example, there's no calendar so one can't go back to the day a task was set. I'll give it another week or so but if I haven't got to grips with it by then I will delete the app. This app is far too difficult to use for my little brain (IQ 147) so I have uninstalled it.;0
Too hard to use. No tutorials make it worse;0
you need to subscrib the app to use it they make alot of thing lock and to unlock it you need to subscrib .;0
The natural language thing is a gimmick and a nightmare to use. Simple tools would be so much easier. Despite paying for Premium, just to get reminders, it took me almost 10 minutes to set a recurring task and it still didn't automatically set a reminder. I've been patient, I've tried, I've read and re-read all the rules (spent hours trying to learn everything) but it still doesn't work. It obviously works for most people but I found it to be an over-complicated and frustrating waste of time.;0
Rescheduling tasks is simply randomly not working. Rescheduling something for today can make task dissapear, earlier I have experienced that it duplicated tasks. This way a basic functionality is broken and I just lost what should I follow-up today... No activity log available, as that is a paid feature. I guess I will never try that now.;0
Looking at the features and lots of accolades I tried uninstalled after just a trial. Reason: In the free version notification feature is missing. If the task misses the set time, there is no notification. We will come to know only if we open the app. Insanely Ridiculous. Not sure what have the product team thought while excluding such a basic feature.;0
Subscription service to enable simple reminders is ridiculous. I was willing to pay a one time fee for a solid app, but having to pay nearly $5 per month just to enable reminders is absurd. Once I saw how many basic features were being kept behind a pay wall, I had to stop using it;0
Please revert to your old version & interface! The new widget has made the app completely unusable. It used to be my favorite task management app and now I'm searching for alternatives, on the verge of uninstalling it! P.S. Please introduce a feature to permanently sort items by date on the widget itself, when you add a new task. I have to keep going to the main app to sort it by date.;0
No Reminder option. Why u showcase it in ad when it's a paid service?;0
Once again you've made this worse by redesigning the widget. It was fine as it was. Now I can't select multiple items at once to perform one action like tick off more than one thing at once or set a new date to more than one item. If this carries on I'm definitely not renewing my subscription. Please restore;0
One of the key premium features of this app is labeling, which unfortunately doesn't work properly. When I try to move a label to a shared section, the app crashes. Additionally there is an inconsistency between Android and iOS in how the labels work. In Android I can see the whole list of labels even without tasks, on iOS a label is deleted when there are no tasks marked with the label. This together makes sharing labeled tasks with my wife really annoying;0
The widget, which is the whole reason I downloaded this app, doesn't seem to be updating anymore, even when I click the refresh button. Additionally, there doesn't seem to be a way to mark a task as not completed once you've already marked it as completed.;0
Seems pretty fancy, but $32 a year for reminders when most competing apps offer that as a basic feature for free??? For a to do list app??? Yeah no thanks.;0
I am using this app for years, premium version. Until now was working fine but for a month or so the sync between mobile and desktop client is not working so the app is useless for me now. Wrote to support without any reaction. Don't recommend.;0
bug bug bug bug bug, please don't tell me these bugs are features because i am a android programmer too.;0
Wow... A To Do list app without the option to make your tasks recurring. I won't lie, I am absolutely baffled that this is omitted. Maybe it's in the web version, or the iOS version, but I'll never know... You tick a date in the calendar and... Where is the tick box for 'repeat every xxx'? Maybe it's a premium feature, I guess I'll never know that either...;0
Todoist has 1 big flaw that really prevents me to use it well: if you schedule a task to be repeated daily and do it few minutes after midnight it will skip a day. Overdue tasks that are completed should add the repeat time to the previous date not be reset to the day they are marked compete!!;0
This is a loser. Upgraded to premium without my permission for a free trial, no option in the app to return to free option. And I'm maxed out on tasks ON the premium. Will delete before I pay for premium. Prior review: Migrated from Wunderlist seamlessly. Much more cumbersome compared to Wunderlist.;0
Dislike the latest widget downgrade - the loss of the ability to select multiple tasks is frustrating. Not sure how long I will stick with this app now as the widget is far less user friendly than previous version.;0
"The recent update is kinda trashy. It no longer automatically assigns dates to tasks when I type ""tomorrow"" or ""on 8th June"" along with the task.";0
"Subtasks are completely useless. If you plan on using subtasks and have it repeat at all, it just does not work. A ""powerful"" Todo list and Google's Keep app with checkboxes has better functionality.";0
An outright scam!!!! For absolutely any basic functionality they are going to charge and everything you add will incur extra charges. Just a get rich quick scam by a couple of cheats.;0
I spent hours trying to get my Wunderlist info imported to todoist with no success. Looks like it might be a decent app, but guess I'll never know.;0
"New android widget is garbage. ""Full control"" yea ok you took away useful features and gave us more theme options. Can no longer open app from widget and most importantly you can no longer select multiple tasks from the widget which was super useful for rescheduling.";0
After the latest update I cannot find a way to sort my All list by due date any more. Thus the app is now useless to me.;0
Pay for everything except if you are here only to create and delete tasks. You have to pay for reminder, label, comments or for atleast the dark theme.;0
I couldn't figure out a way to sync with my Google Tasks, and then now the app won't uninstall from my watch.;0
Requires account. It's free because they make money harvesting your data.;0
Mostly features are for premium account and you can not delete account once you create. Disappointed with to this app;0
First, the app changed my task name. Then, the task just disappeared and was not in the app. Bad app.;0
Reminders are a premium feature? Are you kidding me? This is an absolute deal breaker. I deleted after trying for 2 minutes.;0
"""reminders are a paid feature"" That's one of the most basic feature of a to do app!! Why even bother to have a free version? THIS IS STRICTLY A PAID APP.";0
Free or trail version has nothing! You can't set a reminder for your tasks!;0
Don't lock reminders behind a pay wall, or if you do, make it a 1 time purchase.;0
Needs registration. Can't use existing caldav task accounts;0
$36 per year for push notification reminders? No thanks.;0
Will never touch this app again! Tried twice - on both occasions I've regretted it. Considering alternatives like TickTick or even Microsoft Todo, I don't know why you would actually pay for this. Not worth the money. Support is also condescending and incompetent. It's all good though - you got my money. 🤬;0
Was looking for a replacement for Wunderlist, and found this app. Looked like a great alternative to Wunderlist. Installed the app, and started to setup bill reminders, only to find that, thre primary reason fir a To Do app is reminders, is only available for $36/year. REALLY?! NO THANK YOU!;0
Terrible for free use, can't even schedule reoccuring events all at once- have to re-enter everything each time they occur! When you have a lot of things that happen every day, several others once a week, still more at other intervals, this App is useless unless you PAY.;0
Daily emails, can't even see my important emails because of spammers like you;0
A nice little app. Liked most aspects of it... But had to uninstall because of just one feature - reminder. I dont know why would someone decide to ship this very basic feature as a premium one! If an app like this reminds me after two days in an email that I have overdue tasks than there is absolutely no purpose of using such an app.;0
Awful, can't barely open it up. Just black screen on the main activity and that's it. No reboot or reinstall helped. Fix asap.;0
Worthless, u can add tasks and things to do in the future but it won't remind you or allow u to set alarms unless you pay for premium membership... Lame.. #instantdelete;0
Sends lots of emails, you can't choose a duration for your tasks it's only limited to a day . It's good if you like to be bombarded by emails for a task that you totally know it's not over due , also the user experience is too complicated;0
Not as good compared to other apps. Not a very user frndly interface and essential features like reminders are pro features.;0
"This app was great, but now in 14.1.0 I can no longer click on a project and see all of its sub-projects and their tasks at once. This is a stupidly frustrating change and it completely messes up how I use the app. Why not make this a setting I can change back, OR leave it alone altogether? I will be manually rolling this app back. Thanks for making more work for me guys. SERIOUSLY STUPID ""UPDATE"".";0
Worthless, uninstalled after 2min what is the point of adding my schedule and goals without having a reminder!! This is the basic goal of the app you can't make it premium just make the full app with subscriptions instead of scamming people to have more downloads;0
Horrible experince. Glitchy and slow with no user friendly interface. Waste of time to download check it out and uninstall after 10 minutes. On top of that the most important features are paid. But wait... its a subscription to pay £4 monthly!! For a todo app which can't do something better than the hundreds free or those with one time payments. Cannot recommend to anyone.;0
I was facing a problem that my reminder never pop out at notification bar when it's time. I have send a few message to support team regarding this problem. But no one reply, just a member who call David, he sent me a welcome message. Then I replied him with my problem as well. He did not reply too. I have just paid for 1 year package, now I hope I can get my refund.;0
One of the main sticking points for me is how well an app does recurring tasks. In particular, not just fixed date recurrences, but the ability to set the next date off the last completion date. So many apps fail to offer this. Alas, I could find NO way to do a recurring task at all, in spite of them saying it can be done. So, much less checking on this nuance, I see no way of doing them at all. Fail. Moving on.;0
"I previously gave 5 stars. New feature forces 1 star. ""When you view a project, you'll no longer see all the tasks in its sub-projects."" is TERRIBLE. please allow it as an option or revert! I set up all my stores (Costco, Walmart, etc.) now there is NO WAY TO LOOK AT MY ENTIRE SHOPING LIST!  I know I could drag sub tasks, but... 1. It's too easy to complete the parent task thus completing all child tasks. Not good...  2. Moving tasks from one parent task to another is also very dif";0
Guys, what is a task limit? Why? It's not the way it should be.;0
Viewing the sub-project tasks inside the main project was an integral feature of the app that I used daily. Removing this without warning as if it were an 'improvement' is unacceptable and makes the app borderline useless for me, and as such I will begin looking for another app that can better suit my needs. Removing features and making pointless changes is no way to retain users.;0
Used to be simple well organized app. Latest update was a major step backwards and makes it unusable and completely unreliable. Do not trust them with your data.... Most of my prior history of completed tasks disappeared. For some reason timed ones seemed to stick around... Completed tasks are now automatically hidden and lose any order you had them in. If you ever care to reference completed tasks in any structure this app is not for you. It's a hot mess now for that. And their backups do not include completed tasks. They claim all your information is backed up securely but when I asked for my completed tasks they were not able to provide my attachments.;0
I couldn't work out how to use this app and decided to stick to my conventional hand written to do list and I uninstalled this app. However, I still keep getting 'reminders' about things I never even put in myself (they seemed to be there, maybe as examples?, when I first installed the app). I find this really annoying. How can this even happen!;0
Too greedy on the premium features. I'm not going to pay monthly for the ability to add a description/comment to my task. Without this, you have a one liner for the task. There are tons of alternatives that do the same things as this app. I tried this one, the premium features don't interest me and the rest isn't worth a subscription.;0
"Requires account to use.   I was just giving a simple reason why I didn't like it. But since your response indicates I don't have 10 seconds, then I'll waist 5 minutes to make you understand.  The point is that it ""Requires An Account""! I don't need another stinking account to keep track of a task list. If I wanted to share on multiple devices, I would just use any number of desktop applications that I already own. I don't need another stinking program tracking my business in the sake of ""backing up my data' or make it available everywhere. I have that covered already.  Just wanted a simple task list for a small price to use on my phone. But without that choice, no thanks. To act as though 10 seconds to give up my privacy is no big deal, well my information and data is not your business or any one else unless I decide I want to do that. That is what you need to understand, some customers like to have options to do something and not have something stuffed down their throat. Downloaded ""Tasks: Todo List"" and been happy with it. Donated $1.99 to developer for making app for me and not their self.";0
"Downloaded the app so I could have a widget with my list on my home screen. shortly thereafter, tney added checkboxes, which can't be turned off, making it easy to accidentally ""complete"" a task on the widget. And unlike when you have the app open, this can't be undone. It was good when I downloaded it, but is now completely useless.";0
Todoist has LOTS of bugs after update. Most annoying: 1 no longer able to select multiple tasks at a time, 2 when writing a task, keyboard blocks view of task box so you cant see what you're typing, 3completeled subtasks used to remain but crosses out, not it disappears (forcing users to relearn how to use the app), and 4 some tasks scheduled to appear under today does not. Makes you question the integrity of the app. I see no benefits to recent changes. Only bugs.;0
Reminders are behind a paywall;0
Hey todoist! Why are you todoing this to me!? First you put these silly little checkmarks on my tasks that are 100% in my way (leftys are people too). I keep unintentionally deleting tasks and having to dig through my completed items to restore them. That's annoying! Now this latest update, you've taken away subgroups? Subgroups are part of the entire project. Having an overall view of all subs within a group is convenient. Having to flip from sub to sub is illogical. I just don't get it!;0
"I once rated this app and company a five star. However long, with their recent updates they have utterly failed to test the user experience. All the alerts.settings are changed so you get texts, notifications and emails when you had turn them off. The suggested time zone change so their app ""will.function correctly"" breaks the assigned due date times. I like to see companies trying to improve, but if they are this lazy with the user experience who lazy are they with customer data. Lost of all trust here.";0
Really unimpressed that I cannot get notifications unless I subscribe to premium. I can set up memos on my Google calendar & be reminded for free. Why would I pay for that with an app? Without notifications I'll have to remember to check what needs done, where I'm at, etc. I also found it difficult to figure out how to navigate & use what little was included in the free version. Gave up in frustration when I realized that to be actually useful I'd have to pay extra.;0
reply to developer: whatsapp continues to run in background and show notifications even after being closed. why are you unable to do that? .. original comment: I paid $4 for the reminders. However, reminders work only when the application is active. If you exit / shut-down the application, no reminders for you. Developer should design the application in such a way that it continues to run in background even when user exits it. I would like to have my money back unless this problem is rectified.;0
I've spent lot of time creating great multilevel reccuring subtasks just to find out that I actually see them unorganized in most needful page - today! And in Projects they are organized, but all together, regardless deadline. This is sooooo inconvenient, that makes having subtasks functionality just useless. Why can't you show subtasks under their parents everywhere? REPLY: Sorry, but it's inconsistent logic, as currently you show subtasks, that are NOT due today under task, that is due today.;0
I agree with a previous user that recent updates are making the app worse. I've used this app for several years and loved that my to-do list syncs across devices, but recent changes (specifically, deleting completed tasks instead of leaving them visible/able to be restored, despite modifying settings) make this app basically useless for my purposes. I'm disappointed that I need to find a new app after so long using this one.;0
Like many others, the new big update has severely hindered my ability to use the app effectively. What used to be simple is now cumbersome with a 3x increase in the number of clicks to accomplish simple tasks. It wasn't broken, why did you have to 'fix' it. I'm hoping they roll back some of these changes, if they don't I will probably need to look elsewhere for a todo app.;0
Without premium features it's just garbage. What have kept you guys from removing the free version from Play store?;0
Nice app, great features, good design, however the pricepoint on the monthly fee is ridiculously high and is a must for core features that any to-do app must do, things like 'reminders' and 'labels'... Would try it out properly if the price was right (like 1/12th of what it is now?) but for now it's a pass.;0
The whole point of a to do list is to remind you to get things done with the help of a numeric badge count. Since they can't be bothered to add this feature, the app, is useless to me. You just loss a potential lifetime user who would have even paid a subscription to have that one feature. Other apps can offer badge counts through launchers such as Evie. Don't give me the excuse that Android is not developing this feature.;0
Don't waste your money! Instead, to get a free trial you have to select business even if you aren't a business. Then you can still experience the miserable support experience of 6 days of radio silence (and it has now been 48 Hours of radio silence on my urgent ticket). The app/system/api is fairly good, but I would expect better bug support if they claim to have a business or even premium plan.;0
Pretty cheap when basic features are premium and cost $4 - $5.5 monthly. Immediately uninstalled. I'll stick to Any.do for now. Premium is almost half-price.;0
Too complicated so uninstalled but still getting unasked for and annoying emails every day.;0
"Putting ""reminder/notification"" as a premium feature makes the free version totally useless. Uninstalled.";0
Not as good compared to other apps. Not a very user frndly interface and essential features like reminders are pro features.;0
Everything is a premium feature. Everything else is a basic list;0
Worst only useful when you are using premium;0
Too complicated so uninstalled but still getting unasked for and annoying emails every day.;0
you need to subscrib the app to use it they make alot of thing lock and to unlock it you need to subscrib .;0
In daily tasks, if i tap once on yesterday, it becomes tomorrow. Where is today?;0
"Money-grubbing app that charges ""premium price"" for features that other apps offer for free. I don't see a single feature that would justify spending 4 bucks a month on it. Ad supported is better than this slick dump - at least you pay just once to remove the ads and then you can enjoy your app. That being said, just writing your list out and crossing stuff off is preferable to this with no monthly charge to do it";0
Daily emails, can't even see my important emails because of spammers like you;0
Not really usefull too difficult to use;0
Bad reviews are a real turn off for me.;0
What good is a task management app if it cannot give reminders;0
Without paid membership there was no use of this app.. so guys don't download it.;0
You want me to pay you monthly so I can have a reminder?! Ahahaha, you must be out of your mind!;0
Poor support response or lack thereof. You can't fully delete a history so I had to create a new account. Been waiting 12 days for support to transfer my licence over. Have followed up and still no response. Very disappointing. Ref no 507634;0
Can I rate it zero? I spent time explaining support that new widget doesn't follow anymore default /system android theme. Before this ridiculous widget update it followed it and switched to dark mode automatically. Nothing fixed and only meaningless questions from, most likely, outsourced support is all I got. Note 10 Plus/Android 10/June security patch EDIT I do not use any custom launcher. Running stock firmware, totally;0
glad i only selected 1 month. they try too much to make a sleek design, that its counter intuitive, especially for repeating tasks.;0
This app will send spam everyday, even when you block them.;0
Reminder is a paid feature and the premium version is too costly.;0
Sends lots of emails, you can't choose a duration for your tasks it's only limited to a day . It's good if you like to be bombarded by emails for a task that you totally know it's not over due , also the user experience is too complicated;0
I deleted this app and it still sends me emails everyday! Its a waist of time anyway;0
REMINDERS are a PREMIUM FEATURE in a TO-DO APP? Really????;0
Awful, can't barely open it up. Just black screen on the main activity and that's it. No reboot or reinstall helped. Fix asap.;0
Sends mails claiming monthly payments of $4 without yearly commitment but monthly without yearly commitment costs $7 And also the app is quite crappy without premium, and premium at $4 would still be too expensive for what you get.;0
Every thing is for premium users!;0
Required me to sign in to use it? Pass.;0
Without premium features it's just garbage. What have kept you guys from removing the free version from Play store?;0
App not starting on my Xiaomi Mi 9 SE, Miui global 11.0.6. Just a black screen. The chrome app does work (clicked on add to home screen from the website) but I really wanted to use the widget. Very disappointing;0
Worthless, u can add tasks and things to do in the future but it won't remind you or allow u to set alarms unless you pay for premium membership... Lame.. #instantdelete;0
Way too expensive for the premium features. While I don't mind paying for an app there are many other apps that track to-do items for far less money;0
Reminders are a premium feature, which is what I needed this app for. It really sucks that I can't use reminders for free. I have to continue the search for a good reminders app.;0
"Now you can't even see the *today's* completed tasks without paying premium? Seems like ""how much inconvenience can we cause to the users to force them to pay before they abandon the app?"" This is a todo list. It's not like you've solved a new problem, produce content, or provide any significant service. Response/edit: currently, you can only see by project or subtasks, but not by today's tasks. Seeing today's completed tasks is the bare minimum to observe your progress throughout the day.";0
The company has removed the feature that elevated the tool from others completely unannounced. Without it it's just a list tool with inconvenient UX, limited possibilities of organizing your tasks, absolutely useless and badly calculated karma and overpriced premium. Would not recommend to anybody - there are tons of better tools.;0
bug bug bug bug bug, please don't tell me these bugs are features because i am a android programmer too.;0
Log in required;0
"The recent update is kinda trashy. It no longer automatically assigns dates to tasks when I type ""tomorrow"" or ""on 8th June"" along with the task.";0
No free trial, cant even try it, JUNK. then they spam you forever;0
I need to pay just to use reminder damn never using this app again so money hungry.;0
Terrible for free use, can't even schedule reoccuring events all at once- have to re-enter everything each time they occur! When you have a lot of things that happen every day, several others once a week, still more at other intervals, this App is useless unless you PAY.;0
No options to repeat a task. Why else would i want a to do list? Might as well use a pen and paper.;0
No Reminder option. Why u showcase it in ad when it's a paid service?;0
I just installed the app and ran it to see how I liked it. For my taste, way too crowded UI. Then, I started receiving email notifications at least once a day about a task it automatically creates for the user, which is to add a task. I was annoyed so I uninstalled it. The email notifications continued. I had to manually unsubscribe from receiving email notifications about a task I never created from an app I am not using. Unjustifiable behavior!;0
Have to pay $4/mo if you want the reminders to work. I have ADD. The reminders are the #1 thing I need in a to-do list!;0
Can't work effectively on the free version;0
Was looking for a replacement for Wunderlist, and found this app. Looked like a great alternative to Wunderlist. Installed the app, and started to setup bill reminders, only to find that, thre primary reason fir a To Do app is reminders, is only available for $36/year. REALLY?! NO THANK YOU!;0
You create good think bt every option you when i use just close it and subscription to much price 350 par month os is really....;0
reminders are premium features now, means app is completely useless. need to search for an alternative that can migrate tasks now... great 🙄;0
"Putting ""reminder/notification"" as a premium feature makes the free version totally useless. Uninstalled.";0
Is there a residual value of the service? For example if you take subscription for Evernote, it lets you catalogue your stuff and files that has future use. There is no residual value of reminder once the task is done. Do I need to pay $36 just to get a reminder? All that is needed is just one challanger app. Meanwhile there are loads of other good apps. Using tick tick as a compromise for the time being !;0
The old navigation was better, especially on desktop. I miss being able to edit directly, now I have to go through more steps.;0
I've used the new major redesign for a month or two now, and it's definitely a step back. Especially on desktop web. Editing is such a chore now, I hate the pop-up!;0
Can't match Ticktick with your arrogant attitude.;0
i bought full premium version for lifetime in 2016 and didn't use much at that time. Now it says i have free plan and wants me to pay again for upgrade... please help;0
What mess, can't undo a task if pop up is disappeared, this app is too overrated! Lean from ticktick...........!;0
You literally have to buy premium for it to remind you. Like that defies the purpose of the app. Just go use Tick Tick instead. Its free version has more features than this Todoist's premium version.;0
I dont need my card to set the reminder;0
2 out of 3 features require premium. No, I am not going to do that.;0
it is impossible uninstall this one;0
Reminders is a paid feature. What a joke.;0
, every time I put a task in it removed the number in the name and put it in my inbox.... Why???;0
Really difficult app to use. Loads of problems and shortcomings. For example, there's no calendar so one can't go back to the day a task was set. I'll give it another week or so but if I haven't got to grips with it by then I will delete the app. This app is far too difficult to use for my little brain (IQ 147) so I have uninstalled it.;0
Reminders feature behind in app purchase. Seriously? Thats the most basic function of to do list. No way im going to pay you monthly just for reminders;0
Subscription for reminders $5. Well it's fine I will move to Google Tasks.;0
The smart schedule feature was removed without notice. Until that's fixed to me, the app is like any other to-do app, I've started to look elsewhere;0
Worst;0
Will never touch this app again! Tried twice - on both occasions I've regretted it. Considering alternatives like TickTick or even Microsoft Todo, I don't know why you would actually pay for this. Not worth the money. Support is also condescending and incompetent. It's all good though - you got my money. 🤬;0
Basic features such as reminders and labels need an upgrade. And it costs 3200+ rupees in India. That's how much we pay for an entire year's electricity bill or groceries for a whole month! Way too expensive for such basic features. NKT WORTH IT! USELESS APP!;0
Too hard to use. No tutorials make it worse;0
Anything beyond keeping a simple list (including reminders) is paid;0
Seems pretty fancy, but $32 a year for reminders when most competing apps offer that as a basic feature for free??? For a to do list app??? Yeah no thanks.;0
Baad;0
Many features are available just for premium;0
Garbage;0
Time reminder available to to premium only ..??? Really !!! 🤬🤬🤬 pretty desperate to earn some bucks .;0
Looks like it would be a nice app, but basic functionality like setting a reminder is an in-app purchase;0
Reminders are behind a paywall;0
Used to be affordable. Now more expensive than US pricing!;0
One of the key premium features of this app is labeling, which unfortunately doesn't work properly. When I try to move a label to a shared section, the app crashes. Additionally there is an inconsistency between Android and iOS in how the labels work. In Android I can see the whole list of labels even without tasks, on iOS a label is deleted when there are no tasks marked with the label. This together makes sharing labeled tasks with my wife really annoying;0
"Subtasks are completely useless. If you plan on using subtasks and have it repeat at all, it just does not work. A ""powerful"" Todo list and Google's Keep app with checkboxes has better functionality.";0
Boring;0
Pretty cheap when basic features are premium and cost $4 - $5.5 monthly. Immediately uninstalled. I'll stick to Any.do for now. Premium is almost half-price.;0
Everything included in premium feature . Only frame work is there.;0
Widget not loading?!?;0
Its a bad app at all!;0
I spent hours trying to get my Wunderlist info imported to todoist with no success. Looks like it might be a decent app, but guess I'll never know.;0
No notification on free version ☹️;0
Worthless, uninstalled after 2min what is the point of adding my schedule and goals without having a reminder!! This is the basic goal of the app you can't make it premium just make the full app with subscriptions instead of scamming people to have more downloads;0
It disturbs when they send unnecessary e-mails;0
The natural language thing is a gimmick and a nightmare to use. Simple tools would be so much easier. Despite paying for Premium, just to get reminders, it took me almost 10 minutes to set a recurring task and it still didn't automatically set a reminder. I've been patient, I've tried, I've read and re-read all the rules (spent hours trying to learn everything) but it still doesn't work. It obviously works for most people but I found it to be an over-complicated and frustrating waste of time.;0
I am using this app for years, premium version. Until now was working fine but for a month or so the sync between mobile and desktop client is not working so the app is useless for me now. Wrote to support without any reaction. Don't recommend.;0
I dont like this;0
Basic features like comments and tags are behind a subscription wall;0
An outright scam!!!! For absolutely any basic functionality they are going to charge and everything you add will incur extra charges. Just a get rich quick scam by a couple of cheats.;0
Guys, what is a task limit? Why? It's not the way it should be.;0
Free or trail version has nothing! You can't set a reminder for your tasks!;0
Everything behind a pay wall...;0
Pay for everything except if you are here only to create and delete tasks. You have to pay for reminder, label, comments or for atleast the dark theme.;0
"Reminders, the most basic of features, is ""premium"" in this app.";0
"Updates have shifted to taking *away* features. You can no longer format text in sections and project names, as someone at Todoist decided that was ""simpler."" I'm 90% done switching to Notion and don't regret it one bit.";0
I downloaded this app because it's one that syncs with our smart speaker. However, I have recurring tasks, some of which are daily and that option does not work at all. It works are far as setting them up goes. Once I mark a task as done it skips the next due date. So my daily tasks are only showing up every other day. Not happy with that at all. I am in the process of finding another app ASAP!;0
The sound reminders are basic, should be on the free version. Price is absurd. Just gonna continue with tick tick.;0
Apparently syncs with Alexa but I can't get it to work. Disappointing.;0
"""THE VERGE"", Says this is the best to-do list app right now! WELL...I guess it is best to settle for less than best voted app. This app is missing essential bells and whistles unless upgrading to premium. One particular major example is the Archived Projects. This is a premium only feature, however as folks may miss-click and not undo, they will never see what tasks were needed to complete unless they have a great memory, but then if they had a great memory why would they need a task list....";0

The widget was, finally, perfect. So of course someone had to make it less functional. Because obviously, a 3x2 widget tucked away in a corner of the home screen isn't a thing that a person should be allowed to have. No, clearly, only a widget that's required to take up MORE than half the screen will do. Is there seriously a good reason the widget can't be resized to something sensible any more? Because I can't think of one. And I am seriously frustrated.;0
I'm two years premium subscriber for the app. It seems great but the only thing makes all the benefits disappear for me: inability to see all finished tasks by label. Guys it's high time you added this to Android and Mac. Doesn't seem any difficult.;0
Sends you really annoying emails saying you have zero things to do on your task list or an amount. Even after you uninstall the app it still sends you this unwanted junk. Have to reinstall and delete account.;0
App is good enough but drains your battery, for that reason I'm uninstalling it.;0
Normal app the most features on premium account like backup cloud, comment, labels and reminders too.;0
Even after 2 years the sync is still garbage? Wow just wow...;0
After using this product for a month on the computer and my phone, I have found it to be laggy and frustrating to deal with. The free option isn't as good as other options such as Microsoft To Do and the paid solution offers little more than these either.;0
Used it for 4 years, April they updated it and it's now a productivity killing app rather than a productivity booster app. Why? If you wanna rename your todo list you should be able to just click on the todoist and rename it right? WRONG, it opens a NEW WINDOW with sub taks!! I now have to click 2 times to rename the todo bullet. 2 times instead of 1.. Productivity or stupidity? I'm changing todo apps until they poll their users and understand that this is absolutely horrible.. Bye for now!;0
After getting the premium subscription I found that, Windows 10 app doesn't have any app lock mechanism. So anyone using the machine has access to Todoist! I'd request you to fix these kind of basic things before bringing more features.;0
"--- EDIT: there is some annoying bugs when assigning a date: ""tomorrow"" is sometimes sent to next week and ""next week"" the week after. I double checked my datetime settings. --- Good tool but removing a star because of the subscription model. I would be h";0
Used to be a great app though the most recent update has made the widget unusable. Too small to see and there is no way to change the size, you also can no longer select multiple tasks, or pop out the widget to see multiple days. I requested to go back to the previous version, but didn't get much response so now I'm looking for a replacement.;0
New update to the widget makes it so I can no longer get into the full app by tapping on the widget, I actually have to go into my list of apps or create a whole other shortcut. You tout a fully operational widget but I can't rearrange my list entries via the widget, only the full app menu (and it was already a pain to rearrange my tasks in the first place, I really really wish there was an option to add new tasks to the top of the list rather than the bottom.) I will be trying out new to-do list apps now.;0
It was already very irritating to see your latest added tasks being pushed at the bottom and you have to everytime open the app to rearrange. And with new update you can't even open the app from the widget, you have to create a seperate icon which is super super annoying. Probably gonna uninstall the app if this is not fixed soon.;0
I came from Wunderlist. The most important feature of maintainung a grocery list does not work, because completed task are deleted after one day. I will look around further.;0
New update has lost the ability to click on the widget and open the list full screen. The font is smaller, and ticking off an item on the widget has became more difficult. Please fix, five stars otherwise.;0
Meh/10 Came from Wunderlist. My wife has the iPhone app, and it is a reasonably functional app. Not as full-featured, but okay. This Android app was developed by someone who who does not care about user experience. In fact, they might actively hate their users.;0
Almost no productivity without premium version.;0
Can't drag n reorder lists on widget which is a big issue for me. Google Assistant integration, poor at best, very awkward, it's easily confused, doesnt move tasks, and generally doesn't work for me;0
Reminder is chargeable service . No point;0
Sort by priority is missing;0
Too many bugs and shortcomings to warrant the subscription cost imo. There are some great free todo apps as well which give you additional features over todoist free version.;0
The new widget is terrible. Even in non-compact view, the elements are too small. And I can no longer access the main app window from the widget. This was possible earlier.;0
I'm looking for a Wunderlist replacement. This is nice has some folder features that I'm using, but paying that much for the ability to set reminders or adding notes is insane.;0
Trying to set a reoccurring daily task is so convoluted that it requires reading a lengthy help article 😡😡😡? I've switched to Google Tasks which is way more intuitive.;0
The new widget does not allow me to open the app directly, like it could before. Updates should never remove features. Knocking my review down - rest of the app is still great.;0
"Changes in app function have resulted in consistent missed tasks and ""support"" provides condescending replies regarding the issue.";0
Simple function like sort by name isn't working. Shame.;0
You need to pay to add reminder/alarm which should be a basic feature;0
Subscription required just to set a reminder.;0
Overall, it was good. But I set a Todoist widget, and now I can't get rid of it. It just stays in my homescreen, and I can't delete it. It covers my apps too. When I press it, it doesn't respond, and just stays there like a glitch. It brought alot of difficulty to me. And even after I delete the app, it still stays! And the widget's reminders aren't even mine! I think it's an example for the new Todoist app users. Plesse help me to do something about it.;0
"Earlier it was an excellent app without premiums on reminders and many-many other stuff, literally everything was available. But with time it got only worse, these complicated swipes, circles instead of checklists, and ""modern"" trendy design while neglecting intuituve and easy style. And now what I see, after a year? Everything got even worse. What happened with you?";0
So you tell me to pay every month for same functionality in premium? NO still doing normal in everything else;0
Reminders are a 'premium' feature. No thanks, uninstalling.;0
Way to easy to lose your task as they disapear when checked. Example, I got distracted for 10 seconds with my phone in my hand and ToDoIst app open and when I looked back at my phone 4 task had disappeared and I'm left trying to remember wish task it was! Really bad for an app that suppose to help you organize. I'm uninstalling because of this.;0
Cannot use because of the 299 entry limit. My most important list was split into 7 lists. The first list segment is full, so I cannot add a new entry to the top of it. I copied my lists from Wunderlist, and several lists got split like that. If it had copied starting at the bottom of the list so the first segment was the one not full, I might have been able to make it work.;0
"I am trying to find a decent replacement for Wunderlist. Todoist is merely okay. I'm vacillating between 2 and 3 stars, because the most common thing I need to do (ALWAYS add a task TO THE TOP of a list) is apparently not possible. The most frustrating thing so far is that adding a new task adds it to the BOTTOM of the list, NOT at the top. I NEVER want this behavior. Adding a task at the bottom of the list means the new thing is lost from view and I have to manually rearrange the list. On the web app, you can control where to add a new item by using Shift+A, but there is no preference to ALWAYS do this! There is also no way to do ""Shift+A"" (that I've found) on the Android app. You have to create a task, then manually move it to the top. Also, sorting by date either doesn't work, or sorts the wrong way, because the newest tasks are still at the bottom. I cannot believe that this is the default, behavior, and that it cannot be set in a USER PREFERENCE. I sooooo miss Wunderlist.";0
I subscribed premium however always have issues with syncing with Todolist servers. So my tasks disappeared, rearranged and completely messy. I spent almost an hour every day to arrange them again but next day they gone again. Please fix this.;0
'It's free, forever' but 'reminders are a premium feature.' Hmm. I'm dyspraxic, without much money to waste, and I'm looking for a to-do list app to help with this. Without reminders, this app is functionally useless to me. Disappointed that you've opted to content-carve to this extent, and I'd argue your claim of being free is misleading. Please reconsider which features to gatekeep, because locking basic functions behind a paywall makes me *less* likely to support you financially.;0
While everything else about this app is good, the process of scheduling a task is frustrating. Half of the time, it fails to recognize what I'm trying to set. You should just bring back the old scheduling layout from a few years ago. That was easy.;0
Decent app, but forced to pay for basic features. Not enough customization for tasks;0
It seems like the developer is paying attention to customers, which is a good thing. Hopefully they'll respond to the overwhelmingly critical reviews of the most recent update. The checkboxes simply make it too easy to accidentally mark a task as complete. This is a bad, bad deal. I use Todoist to help me more efficiently run my businesses. If I errantly check off a task, it could cost me a lot of money, and possibly lose me a client. Hopefully you'll fix this right away.;0
"I used to like this app. Been using it for a few years with tolerably okay results. But it's been having too many problems with sync, and with failing to load ""Karma"" data. Not only that, but if you miss checking a box but don't see that omission until the next day, there's nothing you can do about it. Maybe the fatal flaw of this app is that it has too many features for its own good. I'd like to get rid of sync entirely and just use the app on my Android, but apparently that can't be done, and if I delete my online account I delete everything. I think I just want to dump this flawed app and see if I can find a good app that does everything offline in one device with no registration required.";0
I like the app. It works, it's functional, and it's great. However, one thing still strikes me down. Why the hell are reminders a paid feature? Seriously, what's a To-Do app without reminders? I could use even my calendar, or almost any other app, and that would too have reminders, for free. So why should I pay for such a basic feature on a fully fledged app?;0
I tried out this app but decided not to go with it because it wasn't as intuitive as I like and might be missing some features. Imagine my annoyance to receive a reminder email this morning when I specifically turned off all notification settings. This app is probably great for people who like to be nagged. I don't. I like to be organized.;0
It was so good and then the PC version became extremely annoying overnight. I'll add tasks in a project, the app will sync and move the task to an entirely unrelated project on its own. And sure, I can reassign it, but I didn't have to before and that's just an annoying waste of time. I don't mind waiting for it to get fixed, but I might just start looking for a new app, which sucks because I really liked this one.;0
I would rate this app 5 stars except I hate the way it scrambles all your tasks every time you change time zones. It's absolutely maddening if you have a lot of tasks because you'll be forced to re-priotitize every time. Going coast to coast with a layover and you'll be doing it three times. Ugh. [Update] Constantly crashing on my Galaxy Note 9 now. Like 20+ times a day.;0
"Kept getting ""an unknown error has occurred, please try again later"" .... Tried on several devices on my T3 connection, had no problem with other apps immediately after leaving this one. Uninstalled. Sad cuz it looked great. In re: dev's reply, yes I did that. I made sure it was plugged in and turned on too. I did take a look at the .apk and I've found an alternative for me for right now. Thanks.";0
"Lots of emails notifications that you can not stop! Most of the features you need - including seeing a completed task - are all in the pro version (needs payment!) Edit after ""Doist"" reply: I mean the email notifications for the due jobs on the lists. They keep filling my email every day and I could not stop them!";0
The interface is very nice and simple, however, once I got down to using it and setting some tasks(five tasks total), about an hour later I went back to the app to make edits, but instead saw the list of tasks that I have set were deleted. If the app has an issue saving the tasks, it needs to be fixed. I will change the rating once that bug is resolved.;0
"Functions fine in general, easy drag to subtasks. Can't adjust the Notifications to not go through ""Do not disturb"" mode (bad if you work off shifts), can't set timing of notifications. In a productivity app, scheduling is important. Reminders require premium, seriously? I'll just install one of the tons of free apps that include it for free rather than pay $3 month. Overall: Average functioning app that requires paid premium for some basic functions.";0
Seems like a good tool, but almost nothing that I actually need to do with it is possible without a subscription. I'd happily puchase the app, or do a free trial period, but honestly, it annoys me when companies offer a free download only to put everything useful behind a paywall, especially when they try to give a discount for a year's sub before you even really get to try the features. Nope.;0
Fundamental problem in their development cycle...force users to update, but the value to the consumer doesn't have a feedback mechanism prior to forcing the update. Is there not a beta program with participating users? Todoist, that's what you need to fix. For everyone else,my widgets have lost their usefulness and are now just place holders until I can remove the complete buttons, shrink text, have fully customizable widgets, or settle on another app. but really, focus on the root problem.;0
The splash screen says the account is free forever. But to have reminder of events / tasks a fairly fundemental aspect to a task reminder app its £3 per month. That's quite misleading. #response to the developer. Thank you for responding. The main point is that a reminder function is a key aspect of a to do list rather than a premium feature.... best wishes with the app.;0
Some pretty basic standard features in other apps are missing. The options menu is very limited with no option to default a tasks due date, project, category etc. These have to be entered every single time a task is created which makes adding quick tasks on the fly very annoyingly slower than other apps. There is no sorting options or filters on views (ability to create custom views does not exempt this feature from being useful). Too many clicks to edit tasks, eg notes/comments, rescheduling.;0
"Every update have been a step backwards. All the small changes only made everything less convenient and looks like will only continue to do so. The last straw for me is now you can't add things quickly (to default ""inbox"" project) anymore, now you have to spend several more clicks to designate a project, even though I just want to add quickly to the default inbox. Making the quick add widget useless now. Also premium pricing has always been terrible and greedy (monthly cost instead of one time).";0
New lay out is awful and takes extra steps to do everything that was once easy. App no longer syncs to my computer app, which has syncing problems of own. Since the last update it's slow on either set up and honestly no longer as good which is upsetting as I paid for the full year right before the update that screwed it all up. I really hope you guys are working to fix the lag, the lay out and the syncing problem. This last update was a terrible idea;0
I tried the free version. I liked the way, that you are writing the day to remind you and it set itself, but the free version doesn't support calendar and for me this is a big minus. I prefer to use Google task app, that signs up with calendar and reminds you for the task.;0
Guys you created a great app that I'd been using for years, but the latest update is weird. Modal views when selecting a single task (WHY do I need it instead of previous submenu for rescheduling??), no ability to choose multiple tasks (only by top menu - select tasks), strange icons.. That all makes me really sad. Rolled out to the previous friendly Todoist :(;0
"I was keeping track of Christmas gifts by checking then off once they were purchased and looking back by selecting, ""show completed tasks"". Until today when I went to check and they are all deleted. Kind of a bummer. It was convenient that the purchased gifts were hidden and nobody could snoop on my phone unless they knew to select that option. But now I have to go through my hidden gift stash. Which if you are a parent... you know how immpossible that can be with kids around all the time.";0
Beautiful interface and design. Unfortunately most features are locked behind a subscription, including some important features such as viewing completed daily tasks. As is, other top rated To Do apps offer more features for absolutely no cost. Would consider paying a one time fee for it but the subscription is a deal breaker.;0
"Great app. Alas, I'm constantly reminded that ""Hey btw there's a paid version which has the functionality you're looking for : ) "". This is tiresome and the subscription based model just doesn't make any sense. Plus hey! Its expensive.";0
Great app that suffers from the most annoying design flaw. Every time I create a task, it goes to the bottom of the list. I always want the task at the top so I can see it. That's the whole point of using a to do list. So I have to drag the task, one by one to the top. Makes me crazy.;0
I'd like it except the widget is the most important feature for me. It displayed my inbox for about a week and now comes up blank. The tasks are there tho. I can read them if I open them, or open the app. :-( You're not the only organizer with this problem tho. Android 9.;0
Mostly good but simply things like creating subtasks are incredibly fiddly, why can you do it from only projects? Why can you only do it by long pressing and dragging slightly to the right (to much marks is completed) allow a simple option on the menu. Deleting tasks is several options in etc. Doing almost anything other than straight adding tasks is cumbersome as hell and just frustrating. Needs some real UX love.;0
It seems like a good app with good features but it's not intuitive at all. I spent fifteen minutes trying to find a way to skip a repeating task this week and I could mark it done. I try deleting to see if it would delete just that occurrences but it deleted the whole thing. The icons are also not intuitive at all.;0
Can't use with VPN. I practice Information Security and prefer to use a VPN whenever I can. I use 2 Norton & NordVPN (not of course at the same time). In both usage cases, when my VPN is activated it would say there is no connection. I have even tried different servers. Is there a reason that VPNs are a problem for your service? How is your data management & security? Does your company view people's data? How do you keep others from being to steal others data, because username & passcodes...;0
Would be better if the Inbox was not treated as a project, but rather a scheduling location, and that items could be created in the inbox and EASILY (bulk) moved to other projects (but stay in the inbox) to then be scheduled to daily or next week or whatever Tracking would be easier. and the app would get a higher rating and I may actually subscribe.. Its a deal breaker for me.;0
I am not receiving my notifications on any of my tasks/projects I have scheduled, so I end up missing out on things I want to take care of. I have it turned on in Settings. Why is that?... I utilize the Smart Schedule tool, but still no notification. Pls help or fix.;0
Revised review: Sometimes we seek out apps to help with deficiencies or make life work out. App was so great and so functional for months, until a few days ago. I was working around the changed, now cumbersome, reschedule/edit/rename tasks process. But Labels beyond a few characters are hidden now. Todoist Labels was The Thing for this app for me, with efficiently visually seeing/grouping tasks. Had made app ahead of many others. App needs more display settings then...to be usable again.;0
fantastic app a critical flaw... one touch completion, now when you brush the screen your tasks get set to complete and you can't find them easily.. (updated July 25) the developer asked me to respond to comment... thanks for responding. don't fuss on my part .;0
I have read quite a bit about updates being frustrating. Before applying the update, I had hoped to find documentation about changes. Found nothing on the todoist website, no comments in reviews. Update is attempting to be pushed, where's the documentation????;0
it's clear to me that this is the best todo app, and I've used it for a long time, but having reminders be a premium feature is just unreasonable as it's impossible to use a todo app without them. I'll be switching to TickTick.;0
I have used this app for a few years and loved but what have they done with the app?! The major update in December has made adding/moving tasks harder thus makes me less productive Edit to answer: can't always change projects with a simple #, the gui is cluttered with too much going on, when I tap on a task I used to tap out but when I do it comes out of edit mode, goes to the top and I have to back out again to get to list view;0
Lost half its use once they got rid of seeing children categories in the widget. I use ToDoist for homework assignments and I used the parent functions for assignments to categorize what class the assignment is for. Without being able to see all my parent/sub folders from the widget it kills most of the use of the app. I went back to an old APK but then I started getting prompts that the app would stop working if I didn't update. I still use it as a grocery list with IFTTT until Keep is fixed.;0
Maybe it works for some people, but this was absolutely the worst 'to do list' app I have tried! Every time I opened it, therr was a 'feature' blocking my use. The ultimate problem was finding no task delete function.;0
I really dislike the projects thing. Just let me make new lists. I want a list for movies to watch another for gift ideas etc. The best way to do that through this app is subitems which are a pain to deal with. Moving over to wunderlist;0
The premium version might be good but the free version is more restricted then other to-do apps, you can not even use the labels/ tags function without paying. If you are looking for a free todo list this is probably not the app for you.;0
dont like the layout, not very user friendly and you can't see your completed tasks unless you pay a monthly fee that is overpriced. don't recommend. there are much better apps that cost much less or are free.;0
The new update is awful. I have to do so many extra clicks to perform basic operations like moving tasks to different days. Multi-select doesn't work any more and the widget is totally broken. Rescheduling anything from the widget locks it up completely.;0
A lot of functionality but not so simple to use;0
Really liked this app until they started charging for basic functions on a monthly basis...would have been happy with one time charge but not worth $36 a year when there is better for less...;0
the only reason I had premium was because I could get SMS notifications while still be offline and not worry about unreliable push notifications. beats the purpose of having an additional app now than the default calendar.;0
I tested a few task apps, and this one looked promising at first. But very quickly I hit the paywall, even for basic and essential features such as reminders and labels. I'm going to use Trello instead.;0
"There is a bug in this app. No matter what I selected the ""Change time zone to..."" pop up kept coming up. If this could be fixed I would definitely be interested in using it.";0
"Please I need help. When I try to log in with Google in the app, it said ""Unknown error occurred. Please check again in a few seconds"". I've uninstalled and re-installed the app, but no such luck😢";0
The latest update is poorly designed for users with lots of tasks, completely changes the old interface, with attending bugs, out of the blue. Biggest fan to dead in the water overnight. Shocker.;0
As someone who isn't interested in task sharing or syncing, I find it insulting Todoist locks some otherwise basic features like reminder notifications behind a subscription instead of a one-time unlock. That's just greedy.;0
This is only to add your todo list and thats all tou can do with the free if you want to put date and time to let you know you have to do somthing. You pay not good at all With free versions drom other apps do the same this pay app;0
Seems pretty good but most of the options that make if stand out are not available unless you pay for it. Splendo is cleaner and easier to use.;0
App deleted my tasks out of no where, as well as the app seems to be bloated with features. Needs to be more sleek and refined. I dont believe the audience for a to do list app is looking for anything with a lot of features.;0
where my reply ended up i cant see but i am a user for 2.5 years and this app never worked properly for me. i use for the script task adding feature and pay for supporting its development but they are not much interested i guess. businessline.halit.... try searching your emails. i wrote more details in original post.;0
Removing features from the free version is not a good way to attract people to premium version, and the price is way to high. looking elsewhere :-(;0
Almost every feature requires a premium account for 36€ per year... It's not even possible to test these features without subscribing to an annual plan;0
I couldn't find an easy way to make a project recurring without using templates or add attachments and notes to individual tasks.;0
Reminder is chargeable service . No point;0
The sound reminders are basic, should be on the free version. Price is absurd. Just gonna continue with tick tick.;0
Even after 2 years the sync is still garbage? Wow just wow...;0
Overall, it was good. But I set a Todoist widget, and now I can't get rid of it. It just stays in my homescreen, and I can't delete it. It covers my apps too. When I press it, it doesn't respond, and just stays there like a glitch. It brought alot of difficulty to me. And even after I delete the app, it still stays! And the widget's reminders aren't even mine! I think it's an example for the new Todoist app users. Plesse help me to do something about it.;0
"Earlier it was an excellent app without premiums on reminders and many-many other stuff, literally everything was available. But with time it got only worse, these complicated swipes, circles instead of checklists, and ""modern"" trendy design while neglecting intuituve and easy style. And now what I see, after a year? Everything got even worse. What happened with you?";0
"Updates have shifted to taking *away* features. You can no longer format text in sections and project names, as someone at Todoist decided that was ""simpler."" I'm 90% done switching to Notion and don't regret it one bit.";0
Most of it's premium.;0
App is good enough but drains your battery, for that reason I'm uninstalling it.;0
Apparently syncs with Alexa but I can't get it to work. Disappointing.;0
Too complex;0
A lot of functionality but not so simple to use;0
That app is good but I could not benifit;0
I downloaded this app because it's one that syncs with our smart speaker. However, I have recurring tasks, some of which are daily and that option does not work at all. It works are far as setting them up goes. Once I mark a task as done it skips the next due date. So my daily tasks are only showing up every other day. Not happy with that at all. I am in the process of finding another app ASAP!;0
Decent app, but forced to pay for basic features. Not enough customization for tasks;0
I subscribed premium however always have issues with syncing with Todolist servers. So my tasks disappeared, rearranged and completely messy. I spent almost an hour every day to arrange them again but next day they gone again. Please fix this.;0
Almost no productivity without premium version.;0
Sends you really annoying emails saying you have zero things to do on your task list or an amount. Even after you uninstall the app it still sends you this unwanted junk. Have to reinstall and delete account.;0
Everything is premium;0
"- Can't have more than 150 tasks per project, even of you pay. - Can't have more than a couple a certain number of projects, even if you pay. - Sharing from chrome and hitting the ""paper airplane"" button on the keyboard instead of the app dialog freezes t";0
Sort by priority is missing;0
The widget was, finally, perfect. So of course someone had to make it less functional. Because obviously, a 3x2 widget tucked away in a corner of the home screen isn't a thing that a person should be allowed to have. No, clearly, only a widget that's required to take up MORE than half the screen will do. Is there seriously a good reason the widget can't be resized to something sensible any more? Because I can't think of one. And I am seriously frustrated.;0
every now and then, out of blue, it stops syncing across platforms I use. last time it was buggy update, this time is sfsin no idea why.;0
I'm two years premium subscriber for the app. It seems great but the only thing makes all the benefits disappear for me: inability to see all finished tasks by label. Guys it's high time you added this to Android and Mac. Doesn't seem any difficult.;0
"""THE VERGE"", Says this is the best to-do list app right now! WELL...I guess it is best to settle for less than best voted app. This app is missing essential bells and whistles unless upgrading to premium. One particular major example is the Archived Projects. This is a premium only feature, however as folks may miss-click and not undo, they will never see what tasks were needed to complete unless they have a great memory, but then if they had a great memory why would they need a task list....";0
Paywall heavy;0
I realy didn't like titack is better to me.;0
Disappointing...;0
Normal app the most features on premium account like backup cloud, comment, labels and reminders too.;0
Not for me, im trying to setup notif: take medicine at 4 am. Need to pay. Sorry, no.;0
After using this product for a month on the computer and my phone, I have found it to be laggy and frustrating to deal with. The free option isn't as good as other options such as Microsoft To Do and the paid solution offers little more than these either.;0
I came from Wunderlist. The most important feature of maintainung a grocery list does not work, because completed task are deleted after one day. I will look around further.;0
After getting the premium subscription I found that, Windows 10 app doesn't have any app lock mechanism. So anyone using the machine has access to Todoist! I'd request you to fix these kind of basic things before bringing more features.;0
Reminders are a 'premium' feature. No thanks, uninstalling.;0
Used it for 4 years, April they updated it and it's now a productivity killing app rather than a productivity booster app. Why? If you wanna rename your todo list you should be able to just click on the todoist and rename it right? WRONG, it opens a NEW WINDOW with sub taks!! I now have to click 2 times to rename the todo bullet. 2 times instead of 1.. Productivity or stupidity? I'm changing todo apps until they poll their users and understand that this is absolutely horrible.. Bye for now!;0
Way to easy to lose your task as they disapear when checked. Example, I got distracted for 10 seconds with my phone in my hand and ToDoIst app open and when I looked back at my phone 4 task had disappeared and I'm left trying to remember wish task it was! Really bad for an app that suppose to help you organize. I'm uninstalling because of this.;0
Can't really do anything on the free version. No reminder, no scheduling;0
You need to pay to add reminder/alarm which should be a basic feature;0
Did I read that right? To add reminders to my tasks will cost me £36 per year? Are you crazy?;0
Simple function like sort by name isn't working. Shame.;0
Meh/10 Came from Wunderlist. My wife has the iPhone app, and it is a reasonably functional app. Not as full-featured, but okay. This Android app was developed by someone who who does not care about user experience. In fact, they might actively hate their users.;0
Stupid app need more work.;0
I'm looking for a Wunderlist replacement. This is nice has some folder features that I'm using, but paying that much for the ability to set reminders or adding notes is insane.;0
The new widget is terrible. Even in non-compact view, the elements are too small. And I can no longer access the main app window from the widget. This was possible earlier.;0
I'm changing my review from 5 to 2. I'm a pro subscriber and love this app, but latest widget changes for Android are truly terrible. I can't click the todoist icon to get the app open anymore because that's gone, I can't click the reschedule shortcut button anymore because that's also gone, and I can't select multiple tasks to mark done at once via the widget anymore. But hey it's transparent now! Horrible update and I hope the team behind this update sees this review.;0
Too many bugs and shortcomings to warrant the subscription cost imo. There are some great free todo apps as well which give you additional features over todoist free version.;0
Only for singlr use.. cant assign task and sub task to others;0
"Changes in app function have resulted in consistent missed tasks and ""support"" provides condescending replies regarding the issue.";0
"I am trying to find a decent replacement for Wunderlist. Todoist is merely okay. I'm vacillating between 2 and 3 stars, because the most common thing I need to do (ALWAYS add a task TO THE TOP of a list) is apparently not possible. The most frustrating thing so far is that adding a new task adds it to the BOTTOM of the list, NOT at the top. I NEVER want this behavior. Adding a task at the bottom of the list means the new thing is lost from view and I have to manually rearrange the list. On the web app, you can control where to add a new item by using Shift+A, but there is no preference to ALWAYS do this! There is also no way to do ""Shift+A"" (that I've found) on the Android app. You have to create a task, then manually move it to the top. Also, sorting by date either doesn't work, or sorts the wrong way, because the newest tasks are still at the bottom. I cannot believe that this is the default, behavior, and that it cannot be set in a USER PREFERENCE. I sooooo miss Wunderlist.";0
Not flexible enough for my needs;0
Used to be a great app though the most recent update has made the widget unusable. Too small to see and there is no way to change the size, you also can no longer select multiple tasks, or pop out the widget to see multiple days. I requested to go back to the previous version, but didn't get much response so now I'm looking for a replacement.;0
New update has lost the ability to click on the widget and open the list full screen. The font is smaller, and ticking off an item on the widget has became more difficult. Please fix, five stars otherwise.;0
So you tell me to pay every month for same functionality in premium? NO still doing normal in everything else;0
It was already very irritating to see your latest added tasks being pushed at the bottom and you have to everytime open the app to rearrange. And with new update you can't even open the app from the widget, you have to create a seperate icon which is super super annoying. Probably gonna uninstall the app if this is not fixed soon.;0
Trying to set a reoccurring daily task is so convoluted that it requires reading a lengthy help article 😡😡😡? I've switched to Google Tasks which is way more intuitive.;0
The new update destroyed the widget. Terrible.;0
"--- EDIT: there is some annoying bugs when assigning a date: ""tomorrow"" is sometimes sent to next week and ""next week"" the week after. I double checked my datetime settings. --- Good tool but removing a star because of the subscription model. I would be h";0
New update to the widget makes it so I can no longer get into the full app by tapping on the widget, I actually have to go into my list of apps or create a whole other shortcut. You tout a fully operational widget but I can't rearrange my list entries via the widget, only the full app menu (and it was already a pain to rearrange my tasks in the first place, I really really wish there was an option to add new tasks to the top of the list rather than the bottom.) I will be trying out new to-do list apps now.;0
"They fixed the crashing issue. Awesome. My impression of the app was 5 stars after that. What brings me back though is the latest GUI change to the widget. 2 stars now. They took away the ability to easily select multiple tasks. I am considering switching task managers now. I do not see a way to restore the old functionality. Also I used to be able to launch ToDoist from the widget. That button is gone now too. I am a long time user. I've reached the """"enlightened"""" rating on the app. Boo...";0
The new widget does not allow me to open the app directly, like it could before. Updates should never remove features. Knocking my review down - rest of the app is still great.;0
Too complex;0
Why would I pay for this app for reminders? It's just a goddamn simple feature!;0
Can't drag n reorder lists on widget which is a big issue for me. Google Assistant integration, poor at best, very awkward, it's easily confused, doesnt move tasks, and generally doesn't work for me;0
Subscription required just to set a reminder.;0
While everything else about this app is good, the process of scheduling a task is frustrating. Half of the time, it fails to recognize what I'm trying to set. You should just bring back the old scheduling layout from a few years ago. That was easy.;0
Cannot use because of the 299 entry limit. My most important list was split into 7 lists. The first list segment is full, so I cannot add a new entry to the top of it. I copied my lists from Wunderlist, and several lists got split like that. If it had copied starting at the bottom of the list so the first segment was the one not full, I might have been able to make it work.;0
'It's free, forever' but 'reminders are a premium feature.' Hmm. I'm dyspraxic, without much money to waste, and I'm looking for a to-do list app to help with this. Without reminders, this app is functionally useless to me. Disappointed that you've opted to content-carve to this extent, and I'd argue your claim of being free is misleading. Please reconsider which features to gatekeep, because locking basic functions behind a paywall makes me *less* likely to support you financially.;0
Can't use with VPN. I practice Information Security and prefer to use a VPN whenever I can. I use 2 Norton & NordVPN (not of course at the same time).

Why you gotta pay for push notifications or reminders at a certain point.. You guys are just a company trying to get rich.;0
The interface is very nice and simple, however, once I got down to using it and setting some tasks(five tasks total), about an hour later I went back to the app to make edits, but instead saw the list of tasks that I have set were deleted. If the app has an issue saving the tasks, it needs to be fixed. I will change the rating once that bug is resolved.;0
Reminders are kind of a core feature in a to-do list app. Why should I have to pay for it? The app is fine, but I can't use the reminders.;0

There are better options available. I just didn't like the layout and functionality of the app. I tried it for a couple of months but now it's deleted and I am going to try another.;0
Reminder requires payment;0
"Functions fine in general, easy drag to subtasks. Can't adjust the Notifications to not go through ""Do not disturb"" mode (bad if you work off shifts), can't set timing of notifications.

Overall: Average functioning app that requires paid premium for some basic functions.";0
expensive;0
I was shocked to discover that notifications is a paid feature. I uninstalled. Would have been great otherwise.;0
The main feature does not work - it doesn't remind me about todo with system notification;0
The changes made to how completed task are handled are not only bad UX but they introduced many quite critical bugs! Please fix.;0
The widget has been broken for the last couple of weeks since an update. Please fix it.;0
New update is incredibly finicky and makes it difficult to add existing items to projects, change dates, etc. Appending a task with #project_name no longer adds it to the project, it just takes it as a string literal.;0

Not very user friendly.;0
Looks great, but not useful in free plan. And it's very expensive.;0
Yeah keep everything for premium and then say its free;0
I wish there would be a widget on lockscreen;0
It seems like a good app with good features but it's not intuitive at all. I spent fifteen minutes trying to find a way to skip a repeating task this week and I could mark it done. I try deleting to see if it would delete just that occurrences but it deleted the whole thing. The icons are also not intuitive at all.;0
The latest update is poorly designed for users with lots of tasks, completely changes the old interface, with attending bugs, out of the blue. Biggest fan to dead in the water overnight. Shocker.;0
Since last major update, rescheduling a task takes you to the day where it is scheduled, preventing you from quickly rescheduling all tasks on a given day. Productivity killer.;0
Revised review: Sometimes we seek out apps to help with deficiencies or make life work out. App was so great and so functional for months, until a few days ago. I was working around the changed, now cumbersome, reschedule/edit/rename tasks process. But Labels beyond a few characters are hidden now. Todoist Labels was The Thing for this app for me, with efficiently visually seeing/grouping tasks. Had made app ahead of many others. App needs more display settings then...to be usable again.;0
The new update is awful. I have to do so many extra clicks to perform basic operations like moving tasks to different days. Multi-select doesn't work any more and the widget is totally broken. Rescheduling anything from the widget locks it up completely.;0
"Every update have been a step backwards. All the small changes only made everything less convenient and looks like will only continue to do so. The last straw for me is now you can't add things quickly (to default ""inbox"" project) anymore, now you have to spend several more clicks to designate a project, even though I just want to add quickly to the default inbox. Making the quick add widget useless now. Also premium pricing has always been terrible and greedy (monthly cost instead of one time).";0
The premium version might be good but the free version is more restricted then other to-do apps, you can not even use the labels/ tags function without paying. If you are looking for a free todo list this is probably not the app for you.;0
Guys you created a great app that I'd been using for years, but the latest update is weird. Modal views when selecting a single task (WHY do I need it instead of previous submenu for rescheduling??), no ability to choose multiple tasks (only by top menu - select tasks), strange icons.. That all makes me really sad. Rolled out to the previous friendly Todoist :(;0
(Sep 2013) took almost 1 year for decent reminders. Is still annoying to click twice to view the notes. Not very productive! (Oct 2019) with new interface the notes disappeared. The interface is just a copy of Wunderlist or TickTick. What is the point of paying a subscription when the competition offers the same functionality (reminders and notes) for nothing?;0
Not a fan of the new Foundations update. You promised so many new features and didn't deliver any of them. The update to Subtasks didn't fix some of the core issues with them.;0
To many features locked behind premium;0
New layout and functionality is no bueno. Don't like the interface for rescheduling tasks. Please fix!!!;0
"I want to make a note buy present for April but it always converts to buy present due April 1st. I have tried ""April"" instead of April but it also doesn't work. Edit: April' works. It's the most elegant solution I can find. I can't find a way to just type text. If there would be and easy to understand way I'd give 5 stars.";1
So far so good. Wish I could see what was done on any given day. An option to show tasks with a completion indicator (strike through?) would be helpful. Also, would like to be able to mark a task completed for a previous day as I sometimes don't get to mark them on the same day.;1
Switched to Todoist from Microsoft Todo and it has all the features from that and more. I wish that push notifications weren't a premium-only feature, as this was something Todo provided for free. Nevertheless, this is probably the best to-do list app I've used.;1
Found that on the phone app, the amount of tasks you can add to a project is limited (100 or 200), but on the computer version there is no such limitation. Other than that it's a good app.;1
I'm loving this app. I would have given 5 stars, but the only thing I didn't like is that it doesn't have any reminder. You have to buy it. Anyway, overall the app is impressive. You can go for it.;1
Best task manager on the market. The ONLY weak points are sub-task handling and sorting on some views, but otherwise fantastic. Queries, fast entry etc. second to none.;1
This is a really good app, the only reason for four stars instead of five is that it does take awhile to really get the hang of all the different things you can do.;1
There is a bug: I set the widget to 70% transparent black, but after every reboot, the widget's appearance returns to the default preset.;1
I would like to have a widget on my homescreen, but I have to pay, however, it's really good for organize the tasks!!;1
"Loving your program, I've been using it for years. Thank you for your work! One function in Todoist is very missing - now when I complete a task on the tab ""today"" it disappears completely. However, it is much more convenient when it gets crossed out and goes to the end of the daily task list (like in Google Keep). When you see a task done today, you're very motivated to do more. This may be a paid function, but it's not in any form in the section ""today"" or ""coming"" now.";1
This is a great to-do list app. However, the competition offers a lot of features for free which are premium here. This app should offer atleast reminder functionality for free. Maybe they can limit the amount of reminders and projects that you can get in the free version which might make it a compelling app. Right now, in the free version, you can just create lists and projects which are viewable in the widgets, but a reminder should be there even in the basic version.;1
I've been switching between task apps for years, this seems the most intuitive and allows me to be the most productive. Quite a few features are paid for though, and although I would be willing to pay a larger upfront fee, a monthly fee isn't a commitment I'd be willing to make;1
Does what it needs to do. Very good integration with Google Calendar. The time of a task in Google Calendar is standard set to one houre, I'd prefer being able to change the amount of time I estimate to work on a task. Not being able to send emails as a task from different (g)mail accounts is a feature I miss. But overall very good app. Hence 4 stars.;1
Functional and serves all needs for to do lists. Will happily give 5* when integration for Alexa custom lists is implemented.;1
Very simple to-do list app, simple but quite powerful, even on the free plan. There are a lot of other apps that offer more stuff for free, but they are clunky to use. The only problem I have is inability to hide things that are only available with the Premium subscription, such as Labels and Filters tabs, but I understand why they're there...;1
"Good for keeping lists of tasks and working through them. It is worth taking time to learn the different ways to use and organise the app. Sometimes it seems to be working against me eg in certain views, I can't drag tasks up and down a list or can't see them ordered by subject. [Edit follows, to respond to Todoist's reply:] Thanks for replying. Yes, as you say, ""sorting in filtered views is not possible"". Or to use non-developer language, ""Ugghhh, why can't I sort this list by project or in another way that suits me?"" This is the one thing that I dislike strongly about an otherwise excellent app. Wunderlist had better sorting and Tick Tick has it. I would love to see this change in Todoist.";1
A little difficult to get the hang of. But all in all a great app. Only issue I'm having is that my recurring subtasks show up twice on my daily checklist which clutters up the list. The duplicates also appear outside the main task so I can't unexpand them to clear up the clutter. Other than that everything works well so far.;1
"The app itself is very good, and doesn't require Premium to actually be your daily task manager. It is great to see developer providing for desktop/iOS too, and all for free. The aforementioned calendar integration should be done through the web page or desktop (not the mobile app). It works just as advertised, but instead of a ""timeline"" with tasks it's the tasks window with calendar events/tasks. So, works really well, just maybe isn't for me. An exemplary simple app.";1
Very good but don't see why 1 would pay when Google has Google keep , and calendar works about the Same and is free;1
Still learning how to use it, but so far so good! I like how you can set up daily, weekly, etc. tasks to be recurring so you don't have to constantly re-add them. My one complaint is that setting tasks for specific dates that aren't tomorrow or next week is a bit tricky.;1
I have had a wonderful experience with this app. It has genuinely helped me keep track of things I need to do. It has help me gain structure in my life and I am really grateful for it. This is from a guy who doesn't even bother to use google agenda. Lol great app, good stuff and I hope they keep improving.;1
Very well done for improving your task management. Only the lack of badge count for android phone is loosing the 5 stars review;1
Fantastic app to get it together. Still lacking a few features: eg creating lists;1
Overall it's a great app I just wish I could link it with my Google calendar or that it worked better with Google assistant;1
I think its a great app, although I do have one suggestion. After completing a task, especially for the day, maybe it would be more motivating to cross it out and keep it there, so that one could see how many tasks they have completed till then and how much they have left.;1
Missing back buttons on some screens. Otherwise great.;1
Very easy to use and really clear. The only thing I miss in this app is seeing the completed tasks. Besides that it's been a great app that helped my productivity.;1
This is a great tool with a minimalist design. One feature I would be willing to go premium for is the ability to change task orders using drag and drop in the widget. That would take this to the next level.;1
This is the best To-Do app I have found so far, but it's missing some features I would love to have. Sometimes behaves weirdly, when you operate on lists with hundreds tasks.;1
Feature request: I hope I can manually reorder tasks in label views like it's done in project views. Of course, to be synchronized across all platforms. This will be cool.;1
Great and useful reminder app but it has many feature for which we have to buy its premium version. Previously I gave it wrong rating by mistake i giving rating of another apps and by mistake i gave it the rating of another reminder app;1
This was a solid replacement for wunderlist, but it isn't simply a to do list. It's more of productive tasks;1
Good application, it keep me focused on my goals. One downside is whenever I put a new task on a specific day it doesn't areange it automatically, i have to do this manually;1
Great organizer, however, too many features require you to have a paid membership, while similar apps don't require any membership fees.;1
It is a really helpful app. Thank you developers. I'd give it 5 stars if the notifications were somehow better than {overdue} 🤔. Maybe something more interactive [click here] &/or colorful.;1
The app is very good. It makes more productive. The premium features are also good but one issue is that the price should be less for INDIA (INR). As the price is in dollars the price is high for INDIAN.;1
Works great except reordering shared projects always fails (my shopping project, my wife shares and she can never reorder on that project, but no problems on other projects);1
Simple and easy to use. Late task are sent to my personal email each day. This helps encourage me to check on app daily;1
Nice interface, good help, good configurability. Integration with desktop outlook is a bit of a pain though.;1
Am excellent replacement for Toodledo. Still a little rough around the edges, but being actively improved.;1
Pros: Intuitive design Great way to acheive goals Cons: Not entirely free It works with google calendar but each task only can be in 1 hr intervals;1
Appreciate this app. It gives me a convenient way to list tasks on the fly!;1
Love the app but notifications stopped working after couple of days and now I do not get reminder for anything on time.;1
Had this app during college and it great to quickly add in things to do and also to have schedule projects, very clean and easy to use;1
Great app. Does things easily. Maybe a video of effective usage would help.;1
It's okay. Easy to use, just wish incould add a topic/note header toneach individual note.;1
Excellent app with few feature limitation in free versions which are available on similar apps such as comment, reminder etc are locked on free edition;1
Wish I could add pictures to tasks but that's about it for the negative.. Great app. Would highly recommend.;1
This is the best. Why I give this 4 star? Because you need to be in premium to use the alarm thing;1
Easy to use, wish printing lists so they fit on one or 2 pages was possible;1
Just using the free version and use Inbox for just a list of things to do.;1
Easy to use. No dramas. Very streamline for basic list use.;1
Nice if you're bad at remembering everything you have to do. Quick and convenient.;1
Mostly great, I just wish I could make my main to do list my home page.;1
Only wish missed dailys wouldn't count for the current day too. Otherwise brilliant!;1
I like it. Getting use to it. Like the ease of use and the notifications!;1
Right now i started this but feel very happy to install this application is its do easy and fast working.;1
Easy to navigate in order to keep track of tasks.;1
It helps me keep track of my tasks very efficiently :);1
It helps me think through all the elements needed to truly cross something off my list.;1
Overall good, I just wish the alarm feature was available for the free download;1
So good so far. I give 4 stars just because I didn't use all features yet, so need to go back again to that raiting;1
Great app, wish navigating projects on mobile was easier;1
As advertised very well organize... I don't use it as much as my boss... But he loves it... I'm sure I have much more future use for it...;1
The free version is a bit too limeted. However it does worth it;1
Great for groceries and remembering long-term to-dos;1
Great simple app ! I have free version now. I probably need to get the premium version to duplicate and move tasks. Some questions : Does it allow the moving or duplicating of subtasks to another task ... or the elevating of a subtask to be a task or vice versa. Also, are reminders sent as notifications or sound or both.? Also, does it keep a log of completed tasks and/or subtasks. and if so, can you view or export it in some way? With these features it's a 5 ⭐ app❗;1
So far so good..Im seeing if its worth paying for...Ive tried sooo many organizational apps.;1
Some issues with sync but so far, I am enjoying it!;1
Great so far after a few days free trial.;1
Very nice app! Easy to use.;1
Great app! Keeps up to date;1
Some really critical features missing like start time support. I won't want to look at a task all day that I have no ability to complete until later. It needlessly creates a feeling of unproductiveness when you're list is larger than the reality of the tasks justify.;1
Excellent to-do app. It would be nice to be able to customize the font size of tasks and maybe have a more compact mode for displaying a list of tasks within the app. They can sometimes take up quite a bit of space.;1
Easy to use and packed with features;1
"I previously gave this app 5 stars. But current version receives 1 star less. I've been having problems with refreshing widget since I installed the app. But in all the previous versions it wasn't difficult to press the button ""refresh"". The current ver of widget doesn't have that button any more. The only quick way for refreshing is deleting widg and adding it again.. I guess I'll have to downgrade the app to previous versions:(";1
Useful app. Easy to use and handy. EXCEPT - the Todoist calendar only shows the NEXT occurence of a recurring task, not ALL recurrences. This is a recipe for a scheduling conflict, and big omission for an app like this.;1
For now am on love the the app is very very efficient;1
Mostly a good app, helps me keep on top of things. Morning notifications are a bloody lifesaver. My only criticisms are that the free version is rather lacking in basic features, at least for people like me coming from other apps. Also the top bar and the system status bar when in the app are different colors, slightly, and that's always bugged me.;1
I love this app. I tried many to do list apps but this is the one that meets my satisfaction, I guess? The basic features are good, just right. But I'll give it 4 stars since I'm still finding something I myself can't say and it's not here. Maybe it's in the premium version but I'm broke as hell and I can't afford to pay for it because I have other expenses. I do hope that some other features would someday be free, it'll be really helpful.;1
Easy to use very stable and works well with GTD methodology;1
"As much as I love this, it really needs to show completed AND created dates on items. I'm also a bujo user so I'd always want a digital version of this, so it'd be nice to have a weekly specific view in plan ahead and a ""monthly/future log"" i.e. schedule a task for sometime this month, but no specific day. But this is definitely my go-to alternative for Wunderlist. Unfortunately, Wunderlist was free, so for now I'll have to wait and see how being too poor for premium affects me.";1
This is a great app, and I love it, bit I have two small issues with it. First, I don't like how insistent it is with notifying you to complete tasks. Second, I wish the interface had a better tutorial so that it would be easier to have the due dates and such easy to prepare when you enter the task in. Since fixing one would fix both, this is still a great app;1
This handled tasks exactly as expected. Due dates sort into categories, with overdue tasks exposed as well (a simple thing that Microsoft To Do continues to botch). The best replacement for Wunderlist, even if you have to pay for access to simple things like comments and reminders (worth $5/yr at most, but I'll pay the extra to avoid the UX issues in other apps... for now);1
The best app for to-do lists. It does have a couple of minor issues: * The widget can become unusable once in a while (stuck forever on the loading screen). * It can also take a couple of seconds for an item to be removed after you check it off on the widget.;1
"Love the app, but there is a bug in the current version of the app where ""next week"" actually schedules things for two weeks out. Actually scheduling in general in the app seems a little wonky. These are new issues as of a few weeks ago. Otherwise it would be 5 stars.";1
Good app, could be truly great if one more thing was baked in. Imagine if there was a difference between true due dates for tasks and planned dates for finishing them by. I'm envisioning features similar to Trello where you can drag and drop tasks with due dates onto a planning board calendar. This would be excellent for any college students with hectic assignment and exam schedules, or those simply trying to get ahead in their work.;1
"By far and away the best of all the dozens of task manager apps I've tried using! So intuitive. Can't wait for the ""upcoming"" feature that's on the way. But gotta thumbs-down the new widget. No way to open the app straight from the widget so I removed the widget from my home screen all together.";1
This task/project management app revolutionised my life, brought about a clear judgement for prioritizing and balancing work & personal life. My favourite is the recurring task functionality which is excellent for habit creation but not also building consistency in project management. 4/5 cuz I haven't used the premium version yet.;1
I am coming from Wunderlist and I am slowly adjusting to this app. There are several things on that app that are not on Todoist. I wish I could copy repeated tasks to the next week instead of having to retype it. I also would like to be able to see my finished tasks for the week. Completed tasks disappear and are not in the completed tasks (unless it is a sub task). I forget whether I did things or not, hence the reason I need an app like this!;1
By far this is the best to do list app I have used . But I have 2 issues with new widget. First :I can't press the icon and go to the app like I used to. The icon is gone now . And second: the font is too small .really hard to read my list .;1
"Literally just started using this app and really like it so far, it's pretty easy to use, but I wish there were more options for making tasks due. Specifically, being able to make something due ""every 2 days"" or ""once a week"" without having to pick a particular day would be *very* helpful.";1
Need an option to default show the completed tasks. And a Kanban like board view.. like trello with thumbnail support. Overall it's a very good app.. and I have got 1 year Premium.. The best part for me is the notification and reminder syncing across all my devices. All mobiles, laptops and desktops.;1
"I like it okay, so far. But I'm flabbergasted at one behavior. I entered the task ""Do house clean this early evening"". Todoist DELETED the words ""this early evening"" and arbitrarily scheduled a time. I didn't want that. I tried to read-add the text, but it kept deleting it and scheduling the job for 7 pm. The only way I could have time information remain in the task name was to misspell it! I changed ""early evening"" to ""earli evening"". It worked, but it's ridiculous.";1
Great app for the most part. Functionality is amazing. Sync is great. But, I really hate that this app puts itself on top of whatever I'm doing every 5 minutes exactly. Been through all the settings and turned all syncing off but no. Incredibly obnoxious on my tablet. Haven't had the same issue on my Android phone;1
Using the free service: Nice simple app with easy sharing capabilities. I wish there was an easier way to umbrella small projects under large ones without having to share a whole bunch of individual projects. Not a perfect match for my needs, buy very adaptable.;1
"Honestly really liked this app, was 1 of the top 2 out of several however the ""rolling"" daily tasks is what lost me. Otherwise, this is much a newer, bigger, better version of Google Tasks...which I LOVE as well, however it has no share abilities.";1
On the widget, you should have make it able to open the app when we click the task (make us easier to do the editing). And also when input new task, I prefer it was put on top instead of below so we can keep track to avoid double input. But so far still ok. Thanks.;1
I really like this app: the way things are organized and how simple it is. What I don't like is that the completed tasks automatically disappear and EACH time I wanna see them, I have to click on the option to show them. I wish there was a function were you can choose as default if the completed entries are hidden or not.;1
I'm loving this app. I would have given 5 stars, but the only thing I didn't like is that it doesn't have any reminder. You have to buy it. Anyway, overall the app is impressive. You can go for it.;1
"I want to make a note buy present for April but it always converts to buy present due April 1st. I have tried ""April"" instead of April but it also doesn't work. Edit: April' works. It's the most elegant solution I can find. I can't find a way to just type text. If there would be and easy to understand way I'd give 5 stars.";1
Found that on the phone app, the amount of tasks you can add to a project is limited (100 or 200), but on the computer version there is no such limitation. Other than that it's a good app.;1
Ll;1
As advertised very well organize... I don't use it as much as my boss... But he loves it... I'm sure I have much more future use for it...;1
Functional and serves all needs for to do lists. Will happily give 5* when integration for Alexa custom lists is implemented.;1
Straight forward;1
Good but a little overwhelming.;1
Best task manager on the market. The ONLY weak points are sub-task handling and sorting on some views, but otherwise fantastic. Queries, fast entry etc. second to none.;1

Realmente es una muy buena aplicación, es fácil ubicarte y organizarte si ya sabes usar este tipo de apps. Lo que encuentro mal es que hay opciones básicas como añadir notas a las tareas que están escritas, y por ellas hay que pagar. Me gustaría que no hubieran tantas opciones de pago o por lo menos no tan esenciales. De resto está muy bien esta aplicación.;1

This is from a guy who doesn't even bother to use google agenda. Lol great app, good stuff and I hope they keep improving.;1
Right now i started this but feel very happy to install this application is its do easy and fast working.;1
Wish I could add pictures to tasks but that's about it for the negative.. Great app. Would highly recommend.;1
So far so good..Im seeing if its worth paying for...Ive tried sooo many organizational apps.;1
Easy to use. No dramas. Very streamline for basic list use.;1
Works great except reordering shared projects always fails (my shopping project, my wife shares and she can never reorder on that project, but no problems on other projects);1
Very simple and easy to use.;1
Great for groceries and remembering long-term to-dos;1
Very nice;1
It is great;1
Just getting started on it.;1
Overall good, I just wish the alarm feature was available for the free download;1
Appreciate this app. It gives me a convenient way to list tasks on the fly!;1
Nice interface, good help, good configurability. Integration with desktop outlook is a bit of a pain though.;1
Nice if you're bad at remembering everything you have to do. Quick and convenient.;1
Loving it...;1
Easy to use;1
This is great so far! I'm really enjoying getting to grips with it and can see it being a super adaptable tool for keeping track of future events, especially as I can integrate with google calendar. I just wanted to let you know that when I schedule a task for 'Tomorrow', when tomorrow arrives the 'Today' date on the task comes up in brown rather than green. It comes up in green on the web app, but this is something it would be helpful if you could fix in the mobile app :) Overall thanks a lot!;1
We tested four other project management platforms against Todoist for our digital marketing team and nothing can match the simplicity of Todoist. It may look on the surface like it is lacking features, bells, whistles, and polish, but it's simplicity is magical. I am in love with this app. After years of using this for free, I am more than happy to pay your company for the team services. Looking forward to a long relationship of productivity.;1
Thank you so much for this app. This app helps me so much in doing my everyday tasks because I'm so forgetful about what I should do the next day and this app is so easy to add task that I don't feel complicated when I need to add a task quickly. The home widget button is also pretty and easy to use still. Doing daily/weekly/monthly task is so easy. The shortcuts really helped me.;1
"I gave this app a 2nd try after it not working well for me the first time, and it's been awesome. I actually pay for the $2/month premium now so I can make more lists and projects since I use it so much now. I have ADHD, so organization and sticking with a system for longer than the initial ""new and shiny"" stage has been a big challenge--it still is, but using Todoist along with my paper planner has helped me be a more reliable human. Recommend giving it a try!";1
I got lucky that this is the first to-do list app I have ever used. It is excellent in every way! It allows you to add items, prioritize items, move items around on your list, categorize items, and has multiple inboxes all with the free version. More options are available for the premium version if you need them.;1
This is the best to-do app I've used due to the subtask power. For example, I can assign due dates for individual subtasks in addition to the main task. This is extremely beneficial in managing one's time. Also, the inbox is, in my opinion, brilliant. I can input, via voice recognition , a task that needs to be done. I don't know when I can get to it and I don't know how I want to categorize it. So, I put it in the inbox to be scheduled and categorized when time permits. Projects are great also.;1
This app has replaced my chaotic stream of notebooks, carted around in my various bags until their covers fall off and I no longer know where to find anything. I upgraded to the premium version after using the trial month and never regret it. In addition to syncing with my GCal, I have the tab pinned in my browser so I can organize and share notes across my phone and computer with ease. At the day job we use Asana, but Todoist is my choice for both personal projects/hobbies and freelance work.;1
"I'm loving this app. The web browser version is equally amazing since you don't have to go find a bunch of buttons to press to make repeating tasks and can just type ""everyday at 2 pm"" and it very intelligently sets up the reminder for you.";1
Love this app. I use it to keep track of ongoing, long term projects. But you can use it for day to day task (to do list) management Very easy to learn your way around the app and get started quickly. Highly recommended.;1
Very nice app that helps you organize your tasks and time. Links with Google calendar for the best experience. Has a pro version with a monthly payment, but is still very useful without.;1
This helps me to be so much more organized! Huge improvement over my random pieces of paper and lists all over the place. It's simple, fluid, and easy to use. (Written after one week of use.);1
Easy to use and keeps me on top of urgent tasks. Have mine set up as a widget and easy to see what I have to do each day. Works really well for the features I use in the free version.;1
I was looking for the best alternative to Wunderlist. I think I found that in Todoist. In fact Todoist has some features I like ever better. My wife and I share checklists and this is perfect. No silly limitations or crippleware - it just works.;1
Just beginning to use it, as Premium, and I,m really happy. It,s, up to now, the only app of its kind which fulfills my label, filters, functions, etc needs and, wow, allows me to personalise them!;1
Very Good app, if you're interested in a easy and very functional solution to plan out days ( like I do, or just for any type of task list. This is my #1 go to;1
This is so rad. It's so easy. This works with my brain. I made all the lists and categories on my laptop and now I just add to them as needed on the app.;1
I Love how easy it is to navigate the app and all its features as well as being able to stay organized with multiple project on the go is made very easy now!;1
Task apps have come a long way. Use across Mac os, iPad and Android. Really love this app, simple to use, categorise, file, date, action, etc and syncs seamlessly. Paid for premium student option;1
So far so good. I like the projects and sub task features especially. Only been actively using for about a week. Great for todos, not totally sold for checklisting yet.;1
Very easy to use with a simple interface and plenty of features. The web version syncs with the app, and is just as easy to use. I'm more productive already.;1
It's really good. I dont want to have to pay for premium and I wish I could see the tasks I've completed, but at the same time it works really well for what I need it for.;1
Exactly what I've been looking for to manage my personal projects and to do lists. After trying out the free version, I upgraded to paid immediately. It's just the right price with easy-to-use features on mobile and web versions. Not sure how managing team software projects would work on it--we're satisfied with Jira and Rally for those.;1
Excellent, very useful with a smooth powerful and intuitive interface. It's a must to keep my daily tasks on track;1
Not the most features, but probably the most balanced of the to-do list apps. Sync and speed are very robust.;1
I would definitely like the Premium version, I really want those labels and filters!👍🏻 Not to mention ready-made templates - awesome! 😍 And you can make your Todoist as simple or as complicated as you want, with loads of apps to integrate with it. I really think this is one of the very best organiser apps! 💗 Only quibble here is I think it wouldn't have been too much to expect for at least a few reminders to be available in the free version! But thanks for a really great app! 💗;1
I've been using Todoist since 2016 for personal and work projects. I simply love it. Paid my premium subscription yesterday. Couldn't be happier!;1
Glad my dad found this. BEST EVER. this is just amazing. You can do so many things. I am premium and boy i tell you its the best thing ever. From customizing you task to ticking of the task. This is a must have for every type of person and every age. Recomended app.;1
Crazy fun totally functional to-do-list. Good reminders for anything you need to be reminded of. Sinks with your Google account.;1
I like how simple to use the app is. All basic functions that I need are covered in the basic version for free.;1
"Best Project/Productivity App: The premium version of the app has been well worth the $. I have ADHD and struggle with being overwhelmed by the amount of things that need to be done. This app is becoming my ""second brain"" where I can throw everything in, organize it in a way that makes sense to me, and if I only want to look at what I need to accomplish that day I just look at ""Today"". The ability to create sub tasks for my sub tasks is what I've been looking for in other apps but couldn't find";1
Pretty easy system for making a checklist. Also the fact you can share lists with folks is especially nice.;1
This is a great app and I am getting a lot more done than I was before. The only downside is that the premium subscription is a little pricey for a todo app. Seems like a lot of companies are opting for subscriptions to keep the gravy train coming instead of allowing us to buy the app outright. I'd rather own it outright than pay every year or month.;1
Simple design, clean UI, useful for use as GTD and also very powerful when using its filters. The best IMHO.;1
"Really helps me keep track of things, love the integration of ""natural language"" for scheduling dates and times. If I had one complaint/suggestions it would be to make reminder notifications more noticeable. I feel I miss my reminders a lot. However, it's a small issue. Todoist has every feature I wanted from a To Do app, and more than a few I didn't know I needed.";1
Have tried any.do, wunderlist, Google keep, tasks, Evernote. This works the best for me especially since it allows syncing with calender.;1
best app . and a small request that I want a reminder for my tasks because reminder is a premium version.. 🙏🏿 .. I like this app but more than other app ..😊👍🏻;1
The ability to prioritize and assign dates has been awesome in two major ways. First, the underlying stress of not knowing if I'm missing something is way down. I've kept other to-do lists, but they get so bloated and it's easy to lose track of what is really important, and then the very process of going through to check became a job in itself. The second way this app has changed my life is professionally. I answer emails quickly and finish easy things I need to do for teammates first.;1
The sub tasks are really a great help in organizing thoughts and tasks. I also love the Projects section! It gives me the freedom to just dump all the stuff in my head, allowing me to have a space for other stuff to think about. My mindspace is feeling a lot freer than ever before, the simple reminder apps just don't work for me. I like the Karma feature too!;1
Todoist is probably the best to do list app on the market! I had a lot of problems planning my time and tracking my tasks with a bunch of other apps and none of them worked. Don't have that problem with Todoist though. It's somehow the simplest app and yet has the most features I need. The premium version looks cool with a lot of useful bonus features, though I haven't tried it yet. The only thing I'd like for the app to have is recurring tasks in the pasts, so I hope they add it one day!;1
I almost went with TickTick because of the calendar within the app and the habits feature. But in the end I just couldn't pass up the level of organization that Todoist offers. I have ADHD and I really need visuals to get through my days. This app seems to work well with how I think. I feel good at the end of the day when I can clear out my tasks. The integration with Google calendar is useful for planning my days. I will most likely pay for premium.;1
Holy cannoli I freaking LOVE this app! There are so many features and tools to get me organized!!!!! I do have the premium version which has already paid for itself in value. I've been watching how to videos to get more familiar with the app, without watching them I would say there is a bit of a learning curve. This app will be used more than any other app on my device. I love that you can use it on phone and computer. I did a lot of research before choosing a to do list app and it paid off!;1
With my ADHD, this app is a godsend. I use it for a multitude of tasks and it almost certainly makes me better at following through. Lists are handy but Todoist takes it to the next level. Five stars are definitely earned. For me, it's worth the few dollars/month to go premium, but even without all the additional features this app is a must-have for anyone who is in need of that extra mental shelf-space.;1
This app is amazing! It's really helped me streamline my productivity! Definitely recommend.;1
Great, intuitive app. Helping me with time management and productivity.;1
Awesome app! Smart natural language syntax support for task management, cool UX and multi-device sync.;1
By far the best task management app I have used, and i have tried A LOT both professionally and personally. The integration with google calendars is a life saver, there are a lot of options that I always wished for in other apps (sharing with other people, repeating tasks, multiple projects, easy to move between projects, SUPER low maintenance). Bought premium immediately and deleted all my other task apps.;1
TODoist is a FANTASTIC app! It is one of the better apps that I have worked with in business, yet to be honest I first stumbled upon it by looking for a timer app that would interact / syncronize with Trello. It was then that I read that ToDoist DOES sync with many other apps, and that if I were using Pomodone (a pomodoro timer app), then all that I do in ToDoist would be readily synced into Pomodone, allowing me to not only schedule and prioritize my time but ALSO to discipline myself to accomplish it through timers. If you are using ToDoist than Pomodone seems like it was built purely to enable your productivity goals in ToDoist! Together, these apps are unbeatable! Having said all of this, ToDoist is alone ABSOLUTELY worth the time and money to learn and to purchase! I have used MANY different scheduling or GTD systems, and ToDoist is far and away the best that I have used! Do yourself a great favor and learn the keyboard shortcuts!! These are very powerful in action. The app’s ability to understand common language / phrasing is simply uncanny! REALLY WELL DONE!!! I highly recommend ToDoist. I mysefl committed to changing the system that I was already using, (largely because of the tie-in between ToDoist and Trello and Pomodone), and I can certify that it was WELL worth my investment of time!;1
The unpaid version is still useful enough to be beneficial, and has been a great help in managing my tafe assignments;1
I love it! Would just be great if it also had a function where you can see your tasks in Calender format;1
This is fantastic, since i started using this app my life has changed dramatically: i quit drinking, my wife returned to me, even got a raise - the app is a blessing! I could only wish that it had an option for recurring projects, spending my - now amazing - life recomposing the same checklist every week, that's not right.;1
Once I tweaked it for GTD, this is by far the best app out there. Speedy, snappy features and performance in every platform, extremely flexible labels, categories, projects, whatever. Easy rescheduling, adding tasks in the moment and multiple ways to do almost everything . So slick.;1
I really love this app. After experimenting with several productivity apps, this is the best one I found so useful 😃😃😃;1
I love being able to have categories and sub headings within the lists, so work, personal etc;1
Amazing, couldn't do without it! I use it for my personal to do lists/notes.;1
Love the app.....had issues with it stopping syncing with Alexa ToDo list, meaning I had to delete items in both Alexa lists, and Todoist lists, then delete the lists in Todoist, and set up to sync again. Since doing that it seems to be working. Impressed the developer contact me to check whether it was working. The programme and app are both brilliant, and very customisable.;1
LOVE IT. as someone who is all about organising things and checklists, this app is really the best thing for productivity. And most of all, my mental health. :) And it's so intuitive, very easy to use and sort things out - and design of it all, is also another favourite thing of mine.;1
My personal favorite task manager. Natural language has a bit of a learning curve, so if there is a feature you expected it is likely accessible via the natural language task input. A dark theme and cross-platform features also elevate it above the competition.;1
I've tried several organization apps. Most of them were fine, but they would always be missing a feature I needed when something came up and would get me off track. Todoist is so versatile with its features that I can figure out how to put these situations into my schedule without changing the whole system. Keep it up!;1
I use this app for game dev. Helps me keep track of thoughts while working on other ideas.;1
Easy to use, compatible with Wear Os. Use it as daily apps for tracking my task & really love it.;1
My favourite productivity tool ever. I've used it for all my task managing for years now. The app, browser and outlook plugins are all consistent and work perfectly. The support is easy to reach out to and quick to respond. Bought premium after a year of using it and never regretted.;1
Excellent service.....making my day easier.... Really enjoying the service...... with in days the app become part of my life....;1
Use it every day to organize my life. It is easy to use and synchs with my Google calendar.;1
I've been using it for several years. I wouldn't change it with anything else. Very stable, fast and easy to use.;1
Very happy with Todoist after trying various. Easy to pick up and the nice widgets to display and quick add have very quickly become part of my routine, and stuck. Others have lacked smoothness in that area, best I've tried.;1
Simple , quick, reliable and very usefull app. I love it;1
It helps a lot, especially with consistently doing things that I want to do daily or weekly.;1
It's really helped me stay on top of the projects that I want to accomplish. I use the free version for a little while and decided it was worth paying for. The integrations are pretty cool too I'm looking forward to see what they roll out in the way of further integrations in the future.;1
Been using for a week and so far it's the best planner/Todo app I've tried.;1
I wanted the ability to create project, and categorized to-do lists, and this app works perfectly. I really like the home screen widget, and when I've had questions about how to use certain features (i.e. setting a recurring task) a quick Google turns up helpful results.;1
This is the best personal productivity app in the marketplace. Its usability is top notch, its design and flow is smooth and customizable. Its API is a delight to use as an integration-savvy consumer. I trust todoist to be the brains of my family life and even sometimes my career life.;1
I'm using it for planning my job and it really helped me with scheduling the tasks, very useful app;1
For someone with adult ADHD this app is life saving. Within two weeks my life is back to fully organized. The integration with Gmail and Google Calendar is excellent. I couldn't live without it.;1
Absolutely liked it, ease of use and keeps list sorted.;1
Great app for managing my ever growing to do list. There is the option to add tags to separate between work and personal projects. There is also a great feature that allows you to rapidly prioritise tasks by typing p1 p2 p3. Would recommend.;1
Totally love this app! I had no idea they had something like this. You have no idea how much of a relief it is to have something that I can keep organized and get those 'things to remember' out of my head! I don't have to worry about forgetting anything!;1
Very robust to-do app. I love the ability to collaborate and work on to-do items without finalizing or finishing that item. Also has various ways to organize to-do items to make it very organized and neat.;1
I really wanted to like Orgzly, but Todoist’s interface is so much better.;1
Exactly what I need it for - curiously also great for storyboarding ideas for scriptwriting...;1
An app the puts me on the, with Todoist I break down big aims into small tasks per day helping me enjoying the progress Its the best out there, after I've tried several;1
BEST TODO LIST APP. Best way to organize, and schedule tasks.;1
"Really love the app! There's only 1 feature missing in it: The ability to set a task as ""complete by X day"". Would be nice to give the task a deadline while having the notifications every day until you mark it as completed :D";1
Great app! So easy to use, keep everything organised with reminders so I don't have to think. The widget keeps me up to date with what needs doing today. So many great little features!;1
Great experience so far. Only wish that the subtasks remain in the main task and does not show up in all task list with no due date. And a calander view would be nice. Shifted fr Ticktick to this one, and working out fine so far.;1
Great app, very user friendly. Definitely recommend it!;1
Awesome app! Looking forward to upgrading to pro version for more functions.;1
This is a wonderful app, I love the simplicity and intuitiveness - it helps me reduce stress from the many things I need to do and instead allows me to focus and get more things done overall!;1
I really like this app. It usually works flawlessly. But yesterday sincyng with Google calendar simply stopped working for no apparent reason. That was one of my favorite features and now it's gone.;1
I am very satisfied with this App. I does what i expected it to do including reminding about the things to do ans repeating tasks every month. I also love how it is super easy to use and even easier to type in the Task with predictive dates and stuff Overall great app!;1
One of the best To-do list i have ever used. It has lots of feature which helps to work efficiently and effectively. I'm almost using it for 2 months and i really like it. Thanks You Developers for such amazing app.✌;1
This is a great product that helps to keep my life organized. I love how I can add tasks and projects with ease and can mark them off easily as well. I would always recommend that people use apps like this.;1
Good app that works well across both mobile and pc good for grouping tasks together;1
Not only does this app help one in getting things done... It helps you as an individual to just get organized and you end up realizing that there is always enough time to do everything... I highly recommend!!;1
Makes it easy to keep track of everything I want get done, helps break it down and keep track of progress, and stay focused on top priorities until they are completed.;1
The best time management app 3 years using it and it keeps me organised,efficient and productive.;1
"Better than MS To Do. Almost as good as Wunderlist. Only thing missing is the gratifying ""ding"" sound when checking things off.";1
Easy to use. Helpful with dates and templates;1
Best 'to do list' app hands down. Been using for 3 years. Android + mac integration is spot on. I genuinely love it. So so so useful;1
Good;1
Really good for managing all my tasks for the day. I particularly love the widget, that always reminds me of my tasks.;1
Do you what makes this app great and so superior than other? It allows me to sync my tasks to google calendar!!!! Do you know how hassle free my task list and schedule now? It's so bomb I love it!! TRY IT THE REVIEWS ARE TRUE!!!;1
Simple and easy to use. Available for windows too so i can sync with my laptop. Good eficiency.;1
I've been using it for several years. I wouldn't change it with anything else. Very stable, fast and easy to use.;1
Kept me on task;1
The Best;1
Amazing;1
I love being able to have categories and sub headings within the lists, so work, personal etc;1
Only thing missing is adding a description to a task;1
It helps a lot, especially with consistently doing things that I want to do daily or weekly.;1
Very Good app, if you're interested in a easy and very functional solution to plan out days ( like I do, or just for any type of task list. This is my #1 go to;1
Excellent app;1
Easy to use and works well;1
Absolutely liked it, ease of use and keeps list sorted.;1
Very good. When I find myself lost in life (very often) , I swipe my trembling thumb over to Todoist, and am instantly guided back upon the path of righteous order. My day is immediately placed upon terms in which i can fully structure and understand and from which point, seize with a newfound confidence. That, or I reschedule my tasks to the next day. 10/10 I am better for it.;1
I use the app daily for virtually everything from minor reminders to major projects.;1
This is great so far! I'm really enjoying getting to grips with it and can see it being a super adaptable tool for keeping track of future events, especially as I can integrate with google calendar. I just wanted to let you know that when I schedule a task for 'Tomorrow', when tomorrow arrives the 'Today' date on the task comes up in brown rather than green. It comes up in green on the web app, but this is something it would be helpful if you could fix in the mobile app :) Overall thanks a lot!;1
An extremely helpful app;1

thanks *n*;1
Best app ever, haha;1
Good app nice to use;1
Let me keep this simple, I paid for a year. Then tried to find something cheaper. Spent a year trying out various task apps. Have now returned to Todoist, bit the bullet and paid £35. The free version suits most people but I wanted the extras.;1
Helps me alot;1
Easy to use. Helpful with dates and templates;1
Use it every day to organize my life. It is easy to use and synchs with my Google calendar.;1

Great;1
Helping schedule my life;1
Excellent app. Use on my android phone and Windows desktop. Would be nice to have a microphone button on the widget for quick add.;1
I use this app for game dev. Helps me keep track of thoughts while working on other ideas.;1
Feel like I'm getting things done, when they are off the list;1
Great reminder😊;1
Not the most features, but probably the most balanced of the to-do list apps. Sync and speed are very robust.;1
Web version is still more flexible than this. Quick add is a welcome addition.;1
Simple design, clean UI, useful for use as GTD and also very powerful when using its filters. The best IMHO.;1

Very useful!;1
Awesome!! Easy to use......just perfect!!!!;1
Have tried any.do, wunderlist, Google keep, tasks, Evernote. This works the best for me especially since it allows syncing with calender.;1
Provided apk installed, looks a bit better, but still has some delay after click on Complete from push notification. UPD4: no tasks duplication anymore. Delay between click on Complete and task movement to completed tasks list still occurs. Same delay happens when I mark task checkbox fron the tasks list, not only from push. When I snooze task, no such delay at all. UPD5: app hangs on switch betw. tomorrow and today. I have not enough spaces to describe cases there, may you share issue tracker?;0
My experience is the exact same as Theodore's review below. Constant syncing problems with google making the app completely unusable. Started happening around the same date as well (around July 25 2020). I emailed the support team with a description and screen shots of the problem and still haven't received a reply. TickTick USED to be a great app but has progressively gotten worse, and now unusable. That's okay though, I've had to switch back to Todoist because of these issues.;0
"Absolutely refuses to not sync data with Google account. If I try to use a Gmail sign in I HAVE to sync everything with Google. The app will ask 500 times in a row regardless of how many times I hit ""deny"". Makes the entire app totally unusable. Changing emails is a massive pain in the ass if you already have a Google account associated with it. This is absolute garbage.";0
They double billed me for my premium subscription and wont respond to any refund requests. I have been a premium subscriber for over a year, and changed my payment method from Paypal to Google Play subscription, but ended up being billed twice at my renewal (once through each method). I've reached out to their support email address (4 times), and haven't even gotten a response. This app is a good app, but you cannot trust them with your financial information or expect them to respond to you if you have a problem.;0
Has failed to sound and show tasks at the right time or at all, yet still put the recurrence on for the day after. I have a reminder set for every two weeks but it went off after only one week so I took my medication too early, fortunately no harm done to me. Uninstalled.;0
I downloaded this app after hearing good things about it. I had todoist and my subscription ended and I wanted to try this. I downloaded it and brought over all my lists from todoist. After entering everything I uninstallled todoist (bad idea). I decided to upgrade ticktick to premium. Once I upgraded they asked me to sign in which I did. Upon signing in it deleted all the items I had in the app already. Contacted support. Haven't heard back from then yet. What a way to thank me for upgrading.;0
Syncing in the background between Android and Mac hasn't worked for months. Have to manually go into the Android app and do a sync. Doing a background sync on Android after every edit or notification that gets updated would be nice.;0
It's been a good app but I can't sign in now. I can't even renew my premium membership. I love this app but it's been like this for long. You will always be redirected to the sign in page everytime you sign in;0
The in app calendar view doesn't show the tasks I've scheduled. When the devs responded to my 1st play store review, i thought they're going to fix it. But now, even after several updates, it's clear they had not taken my feedback with much seriousness. Uninstalling.;0
Further to my previous comment, it looks like app is hanging on syncing. As same behaviour can be duplicated multiple times. First started happening on 7th July. P20 pro andriod 10.;0
In pomo mode, White noise option gone or not easily found, at least to me. Tried web search with no help. Only silent or Ticking clock option seen, which is annoying. Cannot email customer service, url outdated through web link.;0
The app is really clumsy to use. I took the paid version of this app but still it feels like that the app can't help you with anything. It's better to set a reminder of your own. Money waste.;0
At first oke, unless you don't want to give permission to Google.... Each time you Deny to share you're data, the question simply pops up 10 more times, hoping you click allow. This is pesky!!!;0
Asks me to upgrade just to be able to connect to Google task calendar. Uninstall.;0
I found TickTick not satisfy me, failed to give me alarm on events for a week long testing.. 👎👎👎;0
unable to login in all login options.. it says sign in failed check nw but nw is fine..am able to access internet..;0
Don't trust this. No uninstall information anywhere. Makes it feel scammy.;0
The majority of things are blocked off by subscription.;0
2.70 per month for a to do list app? Are you serious? I would mind an add banner at all and would find it fare I know you guys aren't volunteers but guys don't think that I am as desperate enough as to pay such a fee for to do lists.;0
Poor, practically no functionality available in free version, even day view is restricted. Removing this app from my phone.;0
When I try to set up avatar - photo on OnePlus 6 , I have black screen.;0
Can't import without signing up. I don't want to give up privacy!;0
Annoys user to rate the app. Here's your one star.;0
"Unable to subscribe. I am from India. I think this might be the reason. Whenever I click on pay, it shows ""Unavailable for this purchase"". I have tried using different debit/credits cards. Still same issue. If I open in desktop, I can pay using PayPal. But while converting dollar to rupees, it shows more money than it shows me in android app for subscription price. Also I feel, 1300 Bucks for this is a bit pricy. But seeing American economy, and price in dollars, it may be cheap. But here costly";0
"The date and time parsing is broken. It doesn't recognize "" set up meeting for xxxxx at 9am tomorrow "" It throws an error saying it's past due and sets up at 9 am today . Can you fix this.";0
while using the habbit feature, you can add multiple reminders for drinking water, but if you check done in any one of those reminders then it wont remind for the rest of the day. ruins the logic. Uninstalled Installed a year later and still the issue exists, the habit feature was a unique point which brought me to the app but I guess I'll have to use another one.;0
I purchsed this specifically for the pomodoro feature (among other features). It's not included in the app.;0
I had previous mentioned a glitch in the wedgit, it's been 5 months and was told that a team was working on the glitch. So far there has been no improvement. It's a good app without appropriate maintenance hence the bad review.;0
Another app that fails to draw events correctly on day view If I have an event from 3:00 to 3:15 and another from 3:15 to 3:30 there should be drawn with a space between them no matter how much I am zoomed in, they are not overlapping events so don't treat them like they are;0
"I've used this app for years on several models of Galaxy phones. Very unreliable for reminders. It even has a built in notification that pops up saying ""reminders not working? Do this...."" But the instructions make no sense and don't match the menus of my phone. Uninstalling now.";0
Too many errors.;0
Awful support, unable to move re-occuring tasks before completing previous one, look up the definition of planning again.;0
Worst Experience Ever. I signed out, & All of my Tasks list Gone.... Login bar doesn't even showing what email it was. And I don't remember my email. I was going to buy this App, but hate now. Don't have any way to backup my list.;0
The application looks nice and simple. But the synchronization between mobile and desktop version is awful. A lot of pictures from tasks which were added via desktop version are not accessible on mobile and vise versa;0
Downloaded ticktick. Thought it seemed cool, so signed in with google account and tried to sign up for monthly subscription. Kept getting error messages and it wouldn't let me start the process or even add a card. Waste of time.;0
Automatic synchronisation disabled by developers 🤕;0
You cannot delete the account from application for some unknown reason;0
Earlier this app was working fine but now frequently missing to remind task on set time.;0
VERY GOOD APP BUT IN WIDGET THERE IS A NO OPTION IN LIST WISE SELECT TODAY TOMORROW OR ALL PLEASE UPDATE FOR THIS OPTION THEN IT WILL BE FAR BETTER PLEASE UPDATE EXAMPLE IF THERE'S A CALL LIST IN WIDGET IT SHOWS IN CALL WIDGET LIST ALL CALL TODAY TOMORROW OTHER ALL DAY BUT IT SHOULD OPTION TO SELECT TODAY TOMORROW ETC.;0
38/year y'all out your damn minds. Can't even view a full month calendar with the free version. Only day and week. Silly devs.;0
RUN FROM THIS HORRIBLE APP. I wasted three days trying to get it to work. Duplicates list when importing. App charged me over $150.00. Worst customer service. This is a terrible app. DOES NOT WORK TOTAL RIP OFF;0
Very good app that is perfect for how I think, but it kept asking me to rate the app for months now and I've always pushed Later, I'm sick of it asking me to rate the app;0
The free version is crippled. 3 lists max. Seriously? Just use DTG GTD. To do app with free unlimited nested to-do lists with tags and reminders.;0
"Help! The widgets are not working. It always shows this message"" failed to display your tasks, please restart app or add a new widget instead""";0
Want to know that is there any feature like wunderlist app, to get notification of comment on all shared members on their app as well as on email.;0
Did you delete my previous comment?? Ok, one of the reason todoist is better than ticktick is I cant register my email which is an active and also my primary email. Been few days but I still dont get the verification email yet ask me to change email instead. So thats 1 of many. If you can help me on this, I might consider to try it and give u more stars.;0
Problem with login;0
Useful function require paid membership. Doesn't solve the purpose;0
This app doesn't work the way we won't. It doesn't notify after even permitting it.;0
JUST PURCHASED MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION. UNTIL NOW, MY APP IS NOT WORKING AS A FULL VERSION.;0
Does not work, reminders do not show up.;0
~$30 bucks per year, y'all have lost your minds. Uninstalled;0
Just another app with a subscription based service.;0
Whole other to do list apps provide muce more for a normal user for free, you are just greedy minded pushing everything to be paid.;0
Has so many bugs it's keep crashing;0
This is a bad app. After purchasing a paid subscription, I got a lot of ads instead of an app that helps me plan my business.I hardly see the task scheduler, just advertising. A lot of advertising. The authors are too greedy.;0
I set a reminder since last week. It didn't even ring at the chime of the clock while I observed. It rang post 10min approx, that too when I accessed the app to see what's the fault. Please look into this bug.;0
Update 2/19/2020: I cant recommend this app to anyone. The smart date parsing only works reliably if you enter it using military time. Also the fact that you have to enable alarm mode to have reminders fire on time is ridiculous. I have many apps that push notifications on time and don't require that. So the developers don't know how to do reminders correctly. Horrible app.;0
Kept crashing, rss feed if my calendar duplication of entries was HUGE and overall it just added to the noise rather than helping.. I'm out.. UPDATE: No I can't send a feedback (with log) as I've already unsubscribed and uninstalled the app.. and that's surely something you can add into functionality if you're really interested in gathering the data;0
This app is horrible it was working well at first but when I tried to edit my list titles and add more lists but, it never worked no matter how many times I tried, and trust me that was many, many times. This app is very annoying and over all very useless.;0
The premium version of the app is good....But the free version is useless.. And some school students don't get proper support paying monthly from their family of my country. Every interesting and useful feature arw in premium...;0
The tasks doesnt show up on time and it always overdue and i dont get to finish my important tasks. I have to find another one ... To do list app This app sucks..;0
Worst app for reminder, period. Use google products instead. They will work no matter if you turn on or off the background use. This power hungry good for nothing apps are straight to be ruled out. Well if you don't believe me, give it a try and keep regretting;0
It just vibrate I never get an alert. It only list the task and vibrate when I open the app. It doesn't alert me...;0
"An awesome app. Best in field. But expensive at $30+ subscription for EVERY single year that you want to use the premium feature and yet ZERO way to contact developers for support other than a fairly useless ""Help guide"" that has every question under the sun except the one that you need answered. I would expect much more from an app that cost $30+ each and every year!! Very poor, and a pity because its fundamentally a great app.";0
Hides too much behind the subscription. The day views are an example of this. You'll need to pay each month for the ability to see your data displayed in month, week, 3 day, etc. The app feels broken with all of buttons you can press that nag you to pay monthly for features that should only be paid for once. The features that aren't locked behind the subscription can be found in other to do apps. I tried this app and ended up choosing a different one.;0
Recent update broke sync, battery drain and constant crashing. Sort the basics, before adding fancy features.;0
Max of 9 lists, then you pay 3 bucks a month.;0
No way to integrate with google assistant on a pixel. It's great app by itself, but unless developers figure out a way to make this happen, this gets one star. At the moment todoist has a work around, but ultimately, im just looking for something that allows me to get thoughts into a task list without needing to search for my phone and get into the app. Sorry devs.;0
"""Sorry you have reached the use limit on subtasks. Upgrade now and add up to 199 subtasks per task"". Are you serious guys? Pro version for more subtasks? Why 199, why not unlimited?";0
"Despite working fine with the web version of the app, this Android version of Ticktick throws a validation error on my email address when I try to sign in because (according to Carol, a ""dev"" of the Ticktick team with whom I spoke about this on their help forum) my email address features hyphens. Tf?! Since when are hyphens in address so uncommon that they're not worth supporting. Terrible, imo, UX (both in app and for customer service).";0
I created a task for picking up groceries and set it to a specific day. Why in the world would the default setting in this app be to override my *do not disturb* setting and ring+vibrate at 5 o'clock in the morning on that day. Even though I like the apps functionality I would never recommend it to anyone with these default settings.;0
the app is a great app but customer service is terrible!!! I paid for premium service but my app still runs as the basic plan and I've emailed them multiple times and they finally fixed it but once again this month after i was charged again for subscription the app went back to basic plan vs premium. I've emailed them twice and still no response!!!;0
I never give reviews. I believe in if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it. My issue is not with the app itself, its the fact that I have been charge every single month for over a year! I have reached out to the developer many times and nothing. There is NO subscription for me to cancel...I am really over it with this!!!;0
Does not sync with Google Task List unless you pay 2.99/month or their annual rate. Quite disappointed since their beautiful platform does not meet minimum sync options of Google task lists. I only found out that u had to purchase a task sync option AFTER I connected to my Gmail account. Not cool at all b/c it felt like a misleading bait and switch and now solicitor that I have to block because I synced my email to attempt what it said that it was able to do. Sorry Tick Tick but 🚫⛔👎💃💨;0
It's impossible to use this app. At first, when I choosed pink theme during onboarding, the app ignored my choice. Then I filled it with all my tasks for two days, but when I closed it and opened again, the app asked me to sign up with Google. All my tasks were gone when I did it! I`m deeply disappointed...;0
"Are you kidding me. I down load a ""Planner/Callander app. I go set it all up and link it and try to see the month so I know it's all right my It says I have to upgrade and pay for a month calender View. Ok... Annoying but I try 1 week. Same thing. Gotta pay. Calandar app with only 2 views for oveall use. Please don't say it's a free app or at least explain, can see all these cool features, I'll even let you go through and set up but you have to pay for all the feature";0
Came back to see if I can use the app since I do like it, it's a great idea. I'm my case: I need to be able to add calendar events, reminders in one app 100% essential and afaik this isn't supported? I have a shared gcal, a personal and another work one and all of them needs to not only show up for me to organize life itself. They also need to be managed in the app I use for reminders etc for this to do what it needs for me. Not just reminders, calendar events needs add, edit. Back to any.do;0
The new notifications are atrocious. The don't follow light or dark theme in Android 10, they don't work well with Wear OS, and they turn on my screen when I don't want them to. I'm now getting reminder pop-ups when i don't want any and the option to turn them off is gone. 10/24/2019 - I downgraded to v5.2.3 and got the Reminder Pop-ups option in Settings > Notifications back. When I update to 5.3.0 the Reminder Pop-ups option is replaced with Notifications and Notification Font options.;0
Be aware: if you purchase the paid version and then try to cancel within the 14 days trial. You won't be able to. They only reply once a day if you contact them and every time you contact them you have to explain that you want to cancel the service making the days passed by and after a while they just stop replying back. Using these shady tactics to make the 14 days goes by so you can't cancel after that. This company is a joke!;0
Cancer notifications. I denied the app permissions it asked for one time when trying to change the notification sound. Now it is impossible to change or mute the sound, no matter what setting I change inside or outside the app, and whether or not I give the app the permissions it wanted. 4 stars when this is fixed.;0
"""Hey, want most of the features of our app? Then you'd better pay us $30 a year!"" -this app Response: *laughingly uninstalls and writes this review so I never mistakenly download this again* Just greedy! ""But our on-going server costs!"" I don't need cross-platform sync, and that's not an excuse to hold basic features like notifications and start-of-day planning hostage. Consider a 1-time unlock for all non-server featues and we can talk.";0
for years I use ticktick, I love it so much, I rated it 5 in Play store.. But the recent several changes to the app are make the app getting worse and keep getting worse than before. I incredibly sad and disappointed. for years I rely on ticktick as my todolist app, and now I have to find other alternative that can be as good as ticktick that I know before. that's not an easy thing to do;0
Absolutely terrible. I have a 30 something list of daily tasks to keep track of that are set to repeat. It was very tedious & time consuming to set up with in the first place, but after several days at random points some items would not renew. Not all at once and no discernible pattern as to the tasks it stopped renewing. They show that they are still supposed to repeat daily and they were last checked off several days ago, and will not show up on the list for today. 0/5 stars;0
was loving this app originally, did everything i wanted. Calendar, reminders, lists, habits. Easy to use..... until latest Android upgrade, no longer receiving any reminders. Disappointed, tried everything and the app just doesn't work. Will unfortunately be cancelling my subscription.;0
"wint really allow you to use it or even save tasks, (which disappear). you just get bombarded with limitations and STOP SlGNS if you try to use features while having ""upgrade to ""premium"" ads"" shoved down your throat. I don't even know if this app works or not...that's how "" limited "" it is.";0
The recent UI changes are not intuitive. And the snooze options still suck. Why can't we have a simple 3-digit numerical entry field, plus a period selector with minutes, hours, days, months, etc.? The Life Reminders (LR) app has much better snooze options, and time/date entry options.;0
Deleted my account because I found something more aligned to my needs, but I still got charged for another year. Developer ignored my email and then denied a refund via PayPal so I've now paid $28 for something I can't and no longer want to use. Had no issues with the app itself but very disappointed with the customer service.;0
I have used this app for years but there is now a major issue. If you drag a task to tomorrow or place it under a task with a later date the task date no longer changes date. Is there any way to revert to an earlier revision? Hi I have sent screenshots but the issue is the same.;0
I bought the full version of gTasks Pro from this company and now it's unavailable. Think twice before buying from them.;0
[Happening for the second time in a row...] It's an amazing app, but when I need the most my premium account was deactivated even with the automatic renew. I paid for that and it's not working...so upset!!!!;0
Requires creating an online account to view the calendar. Therefore, there is no reason to use this over Google Calendar.;0
I used to LOVE this app and have used it for a while but now nothing is synving between my devices...Samsung Galaxy S8 and Mac... Nothing at all! No matter how many times i reset and reinstall. I've tried for an hour.;0
Still cannot share a single task with someone on TickTick. You can only share a whole list. This is ridiculous, especially since the developers have promised it since 2013... I need this feature;0
I can not change my font size..;0
I'd rather have continous ads than a payed time subscription. Honestly the subscription seems pretty shady for somethng you can easily do yourself... $3.69 for a month subscription and $36 bucks for a yearly subscription? Seriously? Why not just pay a premium one-time payment costing $10? Pathetic.;0
a reminder app that does not remind. Set several reminders and none alerted when the time is due. previous versions worked great until lately (new version 5.0?) I've tried locking the apps, turn off battery optimization etc...nothing worked.;0
Great app but with a poor 12hr sync to Google Calendar (with no response from the developer in over a year, after an immediate response). If they cant see this is a problem, that is a problem.;0
Cannot share entire calendar and/or task database with other users. Only single daily task shares or individual list collaborations. Edit: very solid low 1 star, 0 if I could, since the developer couldn't even be bothered to read the entire of two sentences of review, acknowledging what features they did have.;0
Guys, This is Chinese origin copy of Wunderlist app which is Free of Cost & here they charge claiming for premium features. Not Worth!!;0
App cannot sync in backround so it does not sync with your tasks created for example on your PC until you open it manually sync it. Very annoying feature and also making your tasks ureliable... Too bad, because otherwise it's perfect... P.S. I already has contacted the support, they sent me automatic reply and nothing has happened since...;0
Good app;0
App is good, however, customer support is not that much. I have contacted them 3 times about an issue and the request is being ignored. I am really sorry that I have to give a low evaluation in order to finally get the attention of the customer support. I am a paying customer for 3 years now;0
Asks me to upgrade just to be able to connect to Google task calendar. Uninstall.;0
Provided apk installed, looks a bit better, but still has some delay after click on Complete from push notification. UPD4: no tasks duplication anymore.

So bad i wish it blocked;0

It was on my phone when I bought it. I have no interest in a trash app like this.;0

Guys, This is Chinese origin copy of Wunderlist app which is Free of Cost & here they charge claiming for premium features. Not Worth!!;0
Worst;0
Do not work on time;0
This is a bad app. After purchasing a paid subscription, I got a lot of ads instead of an app that helps me plan my business.I hardly see the task scheduler, just advertising. A lot of advertising. The authors are too greedy.;0
It's Chinese so fear of data security issues. Uninstalled it;0
They double billed me for my premium subscription and wont respond to any refund requests. I have been a premium subscriber for over a year, and changed my payment method from Paypal to Google Play subscription, but ended up being billed twice at my renewal (once through each method). I've reached out to their support email address (4 times), and haven't even gotten a response. This app is a good app, but you cannot trust them with your financial information or expect them to respond to you if you have a problem.;0
This is the beat app of all !!!!;0
What a wrost feature. It shows my email in conversation section! Fully wrost.;0
I downloaded this app after hearing good things about it. I had todoist and my subscription ended and I wanted to try this. I downloaded it and brought over all my lists from todoist. After entering everything I uninstallled todoist (bad idea). I decided to upgrade ticktick to premium. Once I upgraded they asked me to sign in which I did. Upon signing in it deleted all the items I had in the app already. Contacted support. Haven't heard back from then yet. What a way to thank me for upgrading.;0
It just vibrate I never get an alert. It only list the task and vibrate when I open the app. It doesn't alert me...;0
Problem with login;0
Annoys user to rate the app. Here's your one star.;0
I can't sign in to my account;0
You cannot delete the account from application for some unknown reason;0
unable to login in all login options.. it says sign in failed check nw but nw is fine..am able to access internet..;0
The app is really clumsy to use. I took the paid version of this app but still it feels like that the app can't help you with anything. It's better to set a reminder of your own. Money waste.;0
#boycott chinese products shame on chinese president;0
It's been a good app but I can't sign in now. I can't even renew my premium membership. I love this app but it's been like this for long. You will always be redirected to the sign in page everytime you sign in;0
Waste of time;0
Very bad app;0
I purchsed this specifically for the pomodoro feature (among other features). It's not included in the app.;0
In pomo mode, White noise option gone or not easily found, at least to me. Tried web search with no help. Only silent or Ticking clock option seen, which is annoying. Cannot email customer service, url outdated through web link.;0
The majority of things are blocked off by subscription.;0
When I try to set up avatar - photo on OnePlus 6 , I have black screen.;0
Awful support, unable to move re-occuring tasks before completing previous one, look up the definition of planning again.;0
I didn't like it.. premium for month view?? really 😂;0
Does not work, reminders do not show up.;0
Useless after;0
"The date and time parsing is broken. It doesn't recognize "" set up meeting for xxxxx at 9am tomorrow "" It throws an error saying it's past due and sets up at 9 am today . Can you fix this.";0
Earlier this app was working fine but now frequently missing to remind task on set time.;0
Connects unasked with fb;0
Would be great if they would stop interrupting workflow to beg for reviews. Update: still begging. Also, isn't it a violation of Google's TOS to specifically ask for a 5 star review? I thought you could ask for a review, but not tell people what rating to give.;0
This app doesn't work the way we won't. It doesn't notify after even permitting it.;0
Whole other to do list apps provide muce more for a normal user for free, you are just greedy minded pushing everything to be paid.;0
299 lists, 999 tasks per list, and 199 subtasks per task, these not premium.;0
It won't let me remove my subscription;0
"Unable to subscribe. I am from India. I think this might be the reason. Whenever I click on pay, it shows ""Unavailable for this purchase"". I have tried using different debit/credits cards. Still same issue. If I open in desktop, I can pay using PayPal. But while converting dollar to rupees, it shows more money than it shows me in android app for subscription price. Also I feel, 1300 Bucks for this is a bit pricy. But seeing American economy, and price in dollars, it may be cheap. But here costly";0
Failed to login...i paid so much $$$zzz.;0
Did you delete my previous comment?? Ok, one of the reason todoist is better than ticktick is I cant register my email which is an active and also my primary email. Been few days but I still dont get the verification email yet ask me to change email instead. So thats 1 of many. If you can help me on this, I might consider to try it and give u more stars.;0
Bad and have ads;0
VERY GOOD APP BUT IN WIDGET THERE IS A NO OPTION IN LIST WISE SELECT TODAY TOMORROW OR ALL PLEASE UPDATE FOR THIS OPTION THEN IT WILL BE FAR BETTER PLEASE UPDATE EXAMPLE IF THERE'S A CALL LIST IN WIDGET IT SHOWS IN CALL WIDGET LIST ALL CALL TODAY TOMORROW OTHER ALL DAY BUT IT SHOULD OPTION TO SELECT TODAY TOMORROW ETC.;0
Its not good app because it's not accurate like I set 9:15am when the time reach that time it didn't get notification to me after 9:15 like 9:17,18,20,25 like that;0
I dont like this;0
It's not a good app I don't recommend it everything you have to pay for .;0
"I've used this app for years on several models of Galaxy phones. Very unreliable for reminders. It even has a built in notification that pops up saying ""reminders not working? Do this...."" But the instructions make no sense and don't match the menus of my phone. Uninstalling now.";0
The application looks nice and simple. But the synchronization between mobile and desktop version is awful. A lot of pictures from tasks which were added via desktop version are not accessible on mobile and vise versa;0
Some of the crucial features are premium only;0
Worst Experience Ever. I signed out, & All of my Tasks list Gone.... Login bar doesn't even showing what email it was. And I don't remember my email. I was going to buy this App, but hate now. Don't have any way to backup my list.;0
Worst ever had;0
I can not change my font size..;0
RUN FROM THIS HORRIBLE APP. I wasted three days trying to get it to work. Duplicates list when importing. App charged me over $150.00. Worst customer service. This is a terrible app. DOES NOT WORK TOTAL RIP OFF;0
Just another app with a subscription based service.;0
Useful function require paid membership. Doesn't solve the purpose;0
it doesn't work |:;0
I had previous mentioned a glitch in the wedgit, it's been 5 months and was told that a team was working on the glitch. So far there has been no improvement. It's a good app without appropriate maintenance hence the bad review.;0
~$30 bucks per year, y'all have lost your minds. Uninstalled;0
This app is horrible it was working well at first but when I tried to edit my list titles and add more lists but, it never worked no matter how many times I tried, and trust me that was many, many times. This app is very annoying and over all very useless.;0
I just want to make a checklist 😩. Couldn't figure out how;0
"DON'T UPDATE YET! no subtask sync support. new system ""nested subtasks"" that you create with Android sync those subtasks (to web and to windows apps) as regular parents tasks. and no way to create the previous versions tasks anymore. so no more subtasks untill fixing. wish to Roll back if possible.";0
I thought the app will be really good considering the fact mkbhd uses it, especially the pro version. But I can't click on Microsoft teams meeting links directly and just go to the app. It's a major bummer. I paid for a month and I'm really disappointed. I will probably use it again when i can click on links....;0
The latest update has made my mobile sync completely non-existent. I even uninstalled, cleared junk, restarted my phone, and re-installed, but that actually made it SO much worse -- the app now thinks I'm horribly behind on repeating tasks that I deleted months ago.;0
6 Jul 2020: App locks up or crashes every time I use it for the last couple of months. :-( Whatever you changed, please change it back. Willing to pay for the full version if it works. 10 Mar 2020: Great app! It even keeps the alarm times correct when I cross timezones! :-);0
New update causing app to freeze. Pls correct it immediately.;0
I can't say how much I loved this app before. Now they're making it 'Messier' by badges , etc. It's a professional to-do list app please leave it that way.;0
No notification is showing nor any alarm. I would have given a five, but what's the benefit if the app is not working its main functionality? I don't get any notification when the app is not running in recent apps.;0
loved it until the last update. now the widgets don't show. just a blank white block that says problem.loading widget. please fix.;0
After the task time is over, the app without giving the relax time shows that the relax time is over. It usually happens alternate manner.;0
Great task app BUT it will auto reformat your typing and you can't stop it - this is a huge problem.;0
Can't attach photos, says photo too large on Android, and on iPhone it just fails;0
There is a limit to the attachments that can be made.Not a substitute for wunderlist;0
earlier this was a very good apps, suit for me and my activities. But after I installed it on my PC & change my password, the apps on my phone keeps telling me to reset password from web (even though I already did it) :( so now I can't use it on my phone coz every time I try to open the apps, it always making my phone restart;0
My biggest problem is that there's no free trail and a lot of stuff is behind the pay wall but I'd like to try before I buy. Also, as a first time user there's a few issues: I downloaded it on my tablet and landscape mode doesn't work well for all pages (especially the habit details page). There was also no tutorial so I was left to just click around (when I later downloaded it on my phone there was a tutorial so I'm not sure why there isn't on my tablet).;0
I had thought this was wonderful. Not perfect, but definitely 4 1/2 stars. Recently, it's begun messing with my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 System UI, that must be force closed in order to move on. I've turned notifications off, which defeats most of the purpose, but am still using the app. If I'm able to determine that it wasn't this app, I'll update my review.;0
As a user of GTasks (owned by TickTick), how do I FULLY synchronise my data with the cloud (preferably Google but will make do with the TickTick servers). I pay for this service but only 40% of my tasks are backed up on TickTick server/cloud. Any and all advice much appreciated. kind Regards John Collington;0
It was okay in the beginning, but it's shortcomings are becoming more glaring with use. Also recently the habits simply disappeared recently and the pop up for check in is annoying. I paid for the premium and won't be renewing for a second.;0
The app slider for the font from normal to large is not working. It is only giving two options: normal and large. The slider doesn't slide across and let you set your own font size.;0
If you keyword search, there is no sort. You end up with search results in random order, which is basically worthless, at least to me.;0
The program is very good on my old phone(galaxy note 4), but notifications don't work on the new one(redmi note 8 pro). I hope you will fix them. Thanks;0
I really want to subscribe for premium, but the purchase options are not available, tried alternative option. It's showing unavailable.;0
Eh....not great for an expensive app. One of my important tasks went missing. I asked for help but response hasn't produced the lost task yet...;0
Lacks option to automatically skip all missed recurrences on recurring tasks. Manual skipping of missed recurrences is not a powerful enough solution;0
Very hard to use. Cannot get a list of task to do, until do date;0
This has the beginnings of a great app, but lots more work still needs to be done.;0
All basic features are paid and the free features are very limited...Very disappointing..;0
Good but the paid version did not work as I wanted to use it more so I was disappointed;0
Devs tried to send me a link in the review comments which I can't even copy let alone open from my phone because their apps is too unintuitive to use without a manual.;0
Works well but free version only gives you three total lists;0
Thought the UI was clunky and unintuitive. I bought their premium based on an MKBHD video -- I will be cancelling today.;0
It was ok before. Now it changes the stuff that I enter. Please fix.;0
I'm sure the premium might be fine, but all of the most important features are locked behind a paywall. I wanted a simple app that would let me set repeated reminders on my phone, but this surely isnt it. At first, it told me I just needed to sign up to do that, so I did, but then it said I needed premium! Very misleading, I immediately uninstalled because that is just untrustworthy behaviour to me.;0
All my tasks have been moved half an hour forward. Very annoying.;0
I'm at awe how the tick tick guys keep managing to destroy a perfectly working app by having to redesign it every once in a while just for the sake of saying that they're keeping the app running. Now I can't delete the messages because it's almost barely visible once I push the three dots or lines on the tasks and there is no way to scroll the choices to see the delete option. Please, for the love of gods, don't work so hard to ruin a perfectly functioning software. I'd love to ask, just why?;0
"Annoying! Terrible. I keep going in circles when it tells me to ""sign in"". And when i want to schedule something, the steps r confusing. Never again, until they make it better.";0
I think this app retarted my samsung tab S3 SM-T825Y itself. I had reset my tablets just to know what was my problem. When i reinstall ticktick, it started restart again. Like malware or something. Please fix.;0
Slows down my phone big time;0
"The app is good but the differences between the premium and free version aren't mentioned at the beginning. It is also not possible to start using the app without the ""free trial period"" as far as I have seen. After the forced free trial period I now realize that the sync function which enables you to use pc and and. app simultaneously is indeed a premium function. This seems awful lot like the way Evernote took, I want to buy my apps because I appreciate the work, not because I'm forced into.";0
Has been one of the best reminder app available for a long time. This most recent update messed up notifications on Android 10. They don't follow the system dark mode at all, instead you have to manually change it in the app or deal with mismatched colors. It looks ridiculous seeing a white notification background amidst other black backgrounds in dark mode. It also looks like the black is not a true black like other apps. If this isn't fixed soon, I'll be looking for a new reminder app.;0
Honestly the premium version is just not worth it, what's the point of having advanced calendar views and event setup and calendar import if, in every case, you can't see future recurring events? (The next event in the list of recurring appears only if you have ticked off the previous instance) In order to use a calendar efficiently for planning you ought to see what events are next, this hindrance has been made present by the users as far as 2015 (as I'm seeing online) and nothing has been done, that not only shows poor hindsight (what's a calendar without planning) but also a strikingly deaf customer service. The app is probably just as good as its free version, the pomodoro timer is ok, but the extra features are just not worth the expense for the premium version.;0
"I really like this app, it's one of the best reminder apps there is. However the new custom notifications are horrible! It sticks out like a sore thumb. You have to manually set between white or black background, which means that they don't automatically switch with Android 10 dark mode. They're also not black, but grey which makes them look ugly next to other notifications. Title and time also don't line up with other notifications. Plus it says ""a min. ago"", which is only accurate if I look at my phone immediately. And it turns on the screen when the notification comes in, even if it's in my pocket. This is a great app, but the recent update is one of those 'if it ain't broken don't fix it' moments. I really hope you consider going back to standard Android notifications, or at least provide an option between custom or standard. I'll gladly update my review to 5 stars if that happens.";0
I downloaded and paid for this app several days ago. It has some good aspects. But now I literally HATE some other aspects of it! For example, if you set a specific time for a specific time (e.g. 1-3 pm), it DISAPEARS without giving you a chance to do anything with it. So, if you didn't finish that task, you are out of luck if you want to move it to somewhere else! How ridiculous it is! I'm really scared. I can't trust this tool. I have to switch to something else and cut my losses.;0
This WAS a great list app. Then something happened and I stopped getting notifications. I checked the app and it said I needed to allow permissions due to Android 6.0. I've been on Android 7.0+ since I started using the app, but regardless, I checked and permissions were set and allowed the app to provide notifications. Still didnt work. I've tried resetting the phone, resetting permissions... nothing works. Now I'll try uninstalling it and using something else.;0
The new notifications are useless to me. I always keep my phone on vibrate, and the old normal Android notification would vibrate my phone and notify me on my watch too. But now the new notification pops up silently and is very easy to miss. And I've tried changing the settings and nothing works. I really don't understand why not use Android's build-in notifications instead of this new thing or why is there no option to turn it off?;0
"I love the feature where you can type the timing in the name of the task. This app has great features but one thing doesnt seem to work. ITS THE REMINDERS. I'm neverrrrr of my tasks. I never get the notifications. I tried everything that was wriiten in the ""reminders not working?"" But it still has not been fixed. Could u please look into it asap";0
Had been very good. But now any reminder that is not completed by the end of the day gets marked as complete inatead of showing up as overdue. On repeating tasks, sometimes marking today's as done will also mark 1, 2, or even 3 days into the future as done, with no pattern behind the glitch. Has become very cumbersome to use and has resulted in many tasks getting missed.;0
I think this app is the best option for a to do list except that the sync is terrible. I just paid for premium and the app will not sync. During the trial the sync between android app and PC app was also very bad. If they could get the connection/sync issues fixed it would be a great app. If I can't access the premium features I paid for in the next few hours I'm going to be requesting a refund...;0
I just installed this app on my droid today.  When setting up my account I signed in using my Gmail account.  However, I am unable to do that on my laptop.  I get an error message when I input the Gmail address and password.  I was looking for a replacement for Google's Inbox.  I would like something that is accessible on both my phone and my laptop.  I guess I need to keep looking.;0
The interface is ok. But TickTick does *not* sync with Google Tasks. (You can import Google Tasks, but no tasks added in TickTick app will appear on Google calendar.) If a task list doesn't integrate with Google Tasks, if I am limited to using the standalone app and *cannot* see tasks on other devices / computers, then the task mgmt. app isn't really good for anything.;0
I love ticktick and have returned after trying a few other task apps. The problem is that it's all a it buggy. Emails sent to be added as tasks dissappear if sent automatically through Gmail, and my online Web based tasks are different to those on the app. Maybe time to look again at other apps... 🤔 @ticktick who should I email? I'm also totally fed up as it no longer works with Google Assistant 😢.;0
"Another crappy todo list app I have to delete. I dont understand, all I want is a simple to do list!!! I keep trying to add an item, and it automatically goes into my ""inbox""- whatever that means. I went to the ""help center"" to find a solution, but a long list of topics that isnt searchable is completely useless!!!";0
After update, I couldn't log in to my Google account, the button Allow wasn't working. After applying the workaround and setting an email in web-version, my app on the phone requested permissions to my contacts. I allowed it, the pop-up in the app did not disappear. After pressing 'ok' several times, it went away. However, now the app doesn't fetch the information from the cloud. I wanted to buy Pro, not anymore. You can't fix the bug with Google account for several months now. Embarrassing.;0
Having issues with syncing with Google calendar. I added a task on TickTick and it's been over 12 hours and it still has not sync up to my Google calendar. I've tried refreshing but nothing showed up. I've looked at the help forum and many people have the same issue for some time now. I just purchased the pro and it's not worth it if it doesn't sync.;0
Loved TickTick - great interface and the widget was perfect. Unfortunately I had to move on to Todoist. TickTick doesn't have Alexa capabilities and that's a deal breaker. For a while, IFTTT and Gmail provided a good workaround, but recent changes to Gmail rendered that functionality inoperable. TickTick, get on board with Alexa and I'll come back.;0
I don't know why they changed it, but I hate the fact that you can't type in the time anymore. You have to scroll, like you're on Wheel of Fortune or something. That is the biggest pain in the behind ever invented!!! I don't mind it if there's a option, but this doesn't appear to give you a choice anymore. Please change it back.;0
In general I really like this app but every time it does an update or my phone restarts, I have to go to redo the battery optimization settings because otherwise I don't receive notifications. This is just ridiculous that it doesn't save my settings! 3 months later and still have the same problem...;0
Glitches galore! Currently am unable to see certain options at all, as they are blacked out. Tried deleting & re-installing, resetting phone, & changing the theme to different colors. It's a shame because this is my favorite to-do app & was just thinking about biting the bullet & upgrading. :( If fixed, will definitely reconsider.;0
When u want to add check list this will help you out. Instead of writing some where, u can add them out here. But in the case u want to develop it as a habit, then u have to changes the setting and activate habits mode... Even in that u can create only 5 habits. If u want to create more than 5 habits, u will be asked to update to premium version Only 5 habits thats funny, if its atleast 10 then okay...;0
-When editing or deleting a recurring task it should ask if you're doing it just for this task or all recurring tasks, instead of deleting and editing all tasks without asking. 2- when creating a recurring task I should be able to time it on different tim;0
Not too good for Android! I have the App in my two different type of phones and subscribed for the premium one month in my Android and found out that that version doesn't have all the features described as for example impossible to find or use the sub task feature, create or editing folders, etc. etc. Very disappointed about that, because the App concept seems to me very good. :(;0
Best to do list app except the new notifications have gone haywire. They only pop up at bottom of screen and then disappear if I open any other app. Old standard Android notifications would remain in pull down notification drawer until I dealt with it - far superior. Please bring that back.;0
I liked the app notifications when they worked, gotta pay 2.99 a month? Crazy....mbe a year? Not a month for a calendar app. Most widget features wont work unless u pay, never got to see if they even were worth 299 a month....i like the popup reminders, hopefully someome will make a free one.;0
could not get any realtime notification at all. enabled all notifications, android6.0 or higher option, disabled battery optimization and other security settings. The only time i get the notification is when i manually open the app itself, but then it has already been past the time set.;0
You asked me to pay premium version but instant Google calendar sync still doesn't work, needs few hours for tasks to sync. This been an issue for years already and you ignore pleas from users. On the other hand the Gtasks app you have works really great.;0
Not good. No option to edit tasks (or correct spellings) once entered. Setting time and date not intuitive. Too many steps to make a single entry. Many other drawbacks. Not recommended.;0
Serviceable but not awesome by any means. I've spent enough time trying to set up tasks in here that I feel like I can't bail even though I don't love it. It's really tricky to figure out how to make tasks show up like I want and have only been able to really get things set up right by using the website in addition to the app. Nothing is intuitive or easy to figure out in this app.;0
Easy to use and understand. I have an issue with the reminder settings, if I set a time reminder, then it drains my battery. So I am not able to use this function. Otherwise I am happy.;0
When i share my task on whatsapp Even though i selected share title and content It only shares title Version : 5.2.2 & If i share my task in the form of image the task with long name The end of the name gets replaced with ... Instead of showing the remaining heading on new line;0
Useful. But constantly calls out to access crashlytics, Facebook, etc. Too much spyware. I'm searching to replace it. App also locks you in so you cannot export to another app.;0
App seems ok. But they want you to pay a monthly fee just to use a basic calendar. It let's you view the current week. Anything else and you have to pay. So many free ones out there to choose from. Uninstalling.;0
The basic app is fine. Not great, but fine. However the premium is far too pricey. £27 a year for the ability to set a duration on tasks? That's crazy.;0
great app for your phone but if you need smartwatch functionality, look to Any.Do rather than this app. In dialogues with the devs, theyve stated they have no intentions of integrating even simple WearOS apps (like add task from watch). Uninstalled;0
I found developers lie about free features. I just turned into day view, I asked to login and then I asked to upgrade! In description this option and several other options mentioned as free.;0
Tasks that I change dates does not move to the new date assigned. I'm dismayed because I am a premium member. Moreover, it doesn't have a 1 week or 7 day folder. Apart from the calendar, I also want to see a 7 day list or folder...;0
I love this app but recently it has been freezing every time i add a new task. It's updated and i even reinstalled it yet it is still happening.;0
It was good for a few days, but now it's not loading on my browser at all (Gateway timeout), and changes I made on my iPad are not syncing to my phone. not useful if nothing works.;0
The features that were used to convince me to install all require premium access. Will not buy something with so little real use testing.;0
Now when I get a reminder it wakes up the screen to display the notification. There's no way to change this. Edit: reminder pop-ups is already switch OFF.;0
The app is a little confusing in the way it works and it is a little ridiculous to pay $3 a month just to see a calendar.;0
This is very good app but the monthly cost or yearly cost are not worth it for me. I found a free app that does tbe same things.;0
There's a bug with the planning view, you can't see the title of the event. Other than that the app runs okay.;0
fix the lag on moving events on the day display and I'll subscribe again. ux is clunky get a second opinion;0
Great app but isnt optimized for google Pixel 3xl. i cant re-size the widget to match the size of the screen.;0
Task management is terrible. it will kill the apps running to draw over the screen. frequently my camera shuts off because tick tick notification.;0
Getting annoying, reminder keep jumping out although the task is set one month later. Start Looking for alternatives;0
Loved this app until it stopped syncing... My android app and web app have been out of sync for over 2 weeks;0
Reminder is not working in Realme phone. I did all the settings in my phone and app settings but still not working.;0
"Keep getting a pop up ""Re-authorisation failed"" even though my Google account is already authorised on my account";0
£3 a month to use most of the app... Na. Features are nice, but Disappointed I can't just buy the app.;0
Non-functional with Google account. Was great, but can't use right now.;0
the application is very nive but cant take the complete use of it because of the premium option , and the amount also is high;0
I just spent 30 minutes putting tasks into the app, then went to sync the app with my google account and they all got erased.;0
"i love this app but it reads my texts. i left one in draft and it suggested it as a Todo item. i couldn't find any way to get it to keep is ""eyes"" to itself. not about it.";0
All the main options are charged. Then why list the app for free. Might as well list it as charged app;0
Please fix the widget. It keeps failing to display tasks and asks to restart all the time;0
I'm facing a problem that is reminders are not working properly (device Lenovo k3 note Android 6.0;0

1. There is no ability to use CNTRL F in a task. I can only find which task has that has that search. I can't find what *line* has that search. 2. There is no Undo. If I make an error, like accidentally delete something, it's permanent.;0

There was also no tutorial so I was left to just click around (when I later downloaded it on my phone there was a tutorial so I'm not sure why there isn't on my tablet).;0
I'm at awe how the tick tick guys keep managing to destroy a perfectly working app by having to redesign it every once in a while just for the sake of saying that they're keeping the app running. Now I can't delete the messages because it's almost barely visible once I push the three dots or lines on the tasks and there is no way to scroll the choices to see the delete option. Please, for the love of gods, don't work so hard to ruin a perfectly functioning software. I'd love to ask, just why?;0
It wasn't enough good because Lot's of its features was unavailable.;0
Limit of 9 lists total. Are you kidding?;0
Devs tried to send me a link in the review comments which I can't even copy let alone open from my phone because their apps is too unintuitive to use without a manual.;0
It was okay in the beginning, but it's shortcomings are becoming more glaring with use. Also recently the habits simply disappeared recently and the pop up for check in is annoying. I paid for the premium and won't be renewing for a second.;0
All my tasks have been moved half an hour forward. Very annoying.;0
It was ok before. Now it changes the stuff that I enter. Please fix.;0
The program is very good on my old phone(galaxy note 4), but notifications don't work on the new one(redmi note 8 pro). I hope you will fix them. Thanks;0
Premium version only;0
Good;0
As a user of GTasks (owned by TickTick), how do I FULLY synchronise my data with the cloud (preferably Google but will make do with the TickTick servers). I pay for this service but only 40% of my tasks are backed up on TickTick server/cloud. Any and all advice much appreciated. kind Regards John Collington;0
This has the beginnings of a great app, but lots more work still needs to be done.;0
Very hard to use. Cannot get a list of task to do, until do date;0
Good but the paid version did not work as I wanted to use it more so I was disappointed;0
Works well but free version only gives you three total lists;0
Lacks option to automatically skip all missed recurrences on recurring tasks. Manual skipping of missed recurrences is not a powerful enough solution;0
The app slider for the font from normal to large is not working. It is only giving two options: normal and large. The slider doesn't slide across and let you set your own font size.;0
Reminders doesn't work.;0
Missing everything good about gtasks and adds everything you hate about every other task list app.;0
Didnt like that to really use it as a planner I had to upgrade;0
Having issues with syncing with Google calendar. I added a task on TickTick and it's been over 12 hours and it still has not sync up to my Google calendar. I've tried refreshing but nothing showed up. I've looked at the help forum and many people have the same issue for some time now. I just purchased the pro and it's not worth it if it doesn't sync.;0
Add a feature that let's me tick tasks off from the widget. Either than that I love the app;0
Good, bt nt what I was looking for.;0
Can't post to my google calendar or any other subscribed calendars. Disappointed because this app has promise.;0
I found developers lie about free features. I just turned into day view, I asked to login and then I asked to upgrade! In description this option and several other options mentioned as free.;0
Tasks that I change dates does not move to the new date assigned. I'm dismayed because I am a premium member. Moreover, it doesn't have a 1 week or 7 day folder. Apart from the calendar, I also want to see a 7 day list or folder...;0
C'mon. To have more than 10 lists I've to pay!? Nope... That's not gonna happen;0
I liked the app notifications when they worked, gotta pay 2.99 a month? Crazy....mbe a year? Not a month for a calendar app. Most widget features wont work unless u pay, never got to see if they even were worth 299 a month....i like the popup reminders, hopefully someome will make a free one.;0
widget is not working completely. It does not sync with the app. Plz solve this problem;0
-When editing or deleting a recurring task it should ask if you're doing it just for this task or all recurring tasks, instead of deleting and editing all tasks without asking. 2- when creating a recurring task I should be able to time it on different tim;0
I don't know why they changed it, but I hate the fact that you can't type in the time anymore. You have to scroll, like you're on Wheel of Fortune or something. That is the biggest pain in the behind ever invented!!! I don't mind it if there's a option, but this doesn't appear to give you a choice anymore. Please change it back.;0
From all possible options I've tried out, this has most awkward and unintuitive interface.;0
When u want to add check list this will help you out. Instead of writing some where, u can add them out here. But in the case u want to develop it as a habit, then u have to changes the setting and activate habits mode... Even in that u can create only 5 habits. If u want to create more than 5 habits, u will be asked to update to premium version Only 5 habits thats funny, if its atleast 10 then okay...;0
Night mode doesnt show up under theme;0
Had been very good. But now any reminder that is not completed by the end of the day gets marked as complete inatead of showing up as overdue. On repeating tasks, sometimes marking today's as done will also mark 1, 2, or even 3 days into the future as done, with no pattern behind the glitch. Has become very cumbersome to use and has resulted in many tasks getting missed.;0
Quick Add got fixed. Now the sync is broken.;0
You asked me to pay premium version but instant Google calendar sync still doesn't work, needs few hours for tasks to sync. This been an issue for years already and you ignore pleas from users. On the other hand the Gtasks app you have works really great.;0
Perfect app, except for 12-hour sync with Google calendar;0
Getting annoying, reminder keep jumping out although the task is set one month later. Start Looking for alternatives;0
"I love the feature where you can type the timing in the name of the task. This app has great features but one thing doesnt seem to work. ITS THE REMINDERS. I'm neverrrrr of my tasks. I never get the notifications. I tried everything that was wriiten in the ""reminders not working?"" But it still has not been fixed. Could u please look into it asap";0
Loved TickTick - great interface and the widget was perfect. Unfortunately I had to move on to Todoist. TickTick doesn't have Alexa capabilities and that's a deal breaker. For a while, IFTTT and Gmail provided a good workaround, but recent changes to Gmail rendered that functionality inoperable. TickTick, get on board with Alexa and I'll come back.;0
Reminder is not working in Realme phone. I did all the settings in my phone and app settings but still not working.;0
After update, I couldn't log in to my Google account, the button Allow wasn't working. After applying the workaround and setting an email in web-version, my app on the phone requested permissions to my contacts. I allowed it, the pop-up in the app did not disappear. After pressing 'ok' several times, it went away. However, now the app doesn't fetch the information from the cloud. I wanted to buy Pro, not anymore. You can't fix the bug with Google account for several months now. Embarrassing.;0
not backup in device offline ??;0
I downloaded and paid for this app several days ago. It has some good aspects. But now I literally HATE some other aspects of it! For example, if you set a specific time for a specific time (e.g. 1-3 pm), it DISAPEARS without giving you a chance to do anything with it. So, if you didn't finish that task, you are out of luck if you want to move it to somewhere else! How ridiculous it is! I'm really scared. I can't trust this tool. I have to switch to something else and cut my losses.;0
Please fix the widget. It keeps failing to display tasks and asks to restart all the time;0
£3 a month to use most of the app... Na. Features are nice, but Disappointed I can't just buy the app.;0
Now when I get a reminder it wakes up the screen to display the notification. There's no way to change this. Edit: reminder pop-ups is already switch OFF.;0
Easy to use and understand. I have an issue with the reminder settings, if I set a time reminder, then it drains my battery. So I am not able to use this function. Otherwise I am happy.;0
The free version is garbage compared to any.do. every other click pops up premium warning and it's annoying as hell;0
I love ticktick and have returned after trying a few other task apps. The problem is that it's all a it buggy. Emails sent to be added as tasks dissappear if sent automatically through Gmail, and my online Web based tasks are different to those on the app. Maybe time to look again at other apps... 🤔 @ticktick who should I email? I'm also totally fed up as it no longer works with Google Assistant 😢.;0
Best to do list app except the new notifications have gone haywire. They only pop up at bottom of screen and then disappear if I open any other app. Old standard Android notifications would remain in pull down notification drawer until I dealt with it - far superior. Please bring that back.;0
"Keep getting a pop up ""Re-authorisation failed"" even though my Google account is already authorised on my account";0
Has been one of the best reminder app available for a long time. This most recent update messed up notifications on Android 10. They don't follow the system dark mode at all, instead you have to manually change it in the app or deal with mismatched colors. It looks ridiculous seeing a white notification background amidst other black backgrounds in dark mode. It also looks like the black is not a true black like other apps. If this isn't fixed soon, I'll be looking for a new reminder app.;0
This is very good app but the monthly cost or yearly cost are not worth it for me. I found a free app that does tbe same things.;0
"I really like this app, it's one of the best reminder apps there is. However the new custom notifications are horrible! It sticks out like a sore thumb. You have to manually set between white or black background, which means that they don't automatically switch with Android 10 dark mode. They're also not black, but grey which makes them look ugly next to other notifications. Title and time also don't line up with other notifications. Plus it says ""a min. ago"", which is only accurate if I look at my phone immediately. And it turns on the screen when the notification comes in, even if it's in my pocket. This is a great app, but the recent update is one of those 'if it ain't broken don't fix it' moments. I really hope you consider going back to standard Android notifications, or at least provide an option between custom or standard. I'll gladly update my review to 5 stars if that happens.";0
The new notifications are useless to me. I always keep my phone on vibrate, and the old normal Android notification would vibrate my phone and notify me on my watch too. But now the new notification pops up silently and is very easy to miss. And I've tried changing the settings and nothing works. I really don't understand why not use Android's build-in notifications instead of this new thing or why is there no option to turn it off?;0
I would've switched to TickTick but there is no option to change to a 12 hour setting from a 24 hour. 😔;0
A very good to do manager. I would take a premium version if on the Windows version it would possible to set/change/manage location reminders. For this feature I already wait some years. I'm really surprised that the programmers are not able to add this feature also at the windows app. It's annoying so anoying that you have to edid every task in Android again to add a location reminder..... But it seems to be to difficult for the programmers...??? So when this is to difficult what can we expect? Will the maintanance of the Windows app stay on a reliable basis??? Waiting already since years for a change. Didn't know why the ask me to change settings on Android to change place reminders on my Windows TickTick... May be I should give up 18.10.2019;0
When i share my task on whatsapp Even though i selected share title and content It only shares title Version : 5.2.2 & If i share my task in the form of image the task with long name The end of the name gets replaced with ... Instead of showing the remaining heading on new line;0
In general I really like this app but every time it does an update or my phone restarts, I have to go to redo the battery optimization settings because otherwise I don't receive notifications. This is just ridiculous that it doesn't save my settings! 3 months later and still have the same problem...;0
Loved this app until it stopped syncing... My android app and web app have been out of sync for over 2 weeks;0
such a scam.....!!! first it asks you to sign up for making duration related reminder ,once you sign up it says that you got pay money for that features 😑🤦‍♂️... deleted this app at the next moment of seeing those scam stuffs;0
The latest update has a bug, when holding the top task to drag it down it won't let me do it. I can drag any task but not the first one.;1
I downloaded this app and I didn't expect much but its honestly amazing! I love the simple layout and everything about it. I love that you can add or delete tools like for me, I wanted to have a habit tracker and I could simply enable that. I can clearly see why it is editors choice! Recommend it to everyone! ❤ Edit: You can only do 5 habits with subscription sadly.;1
This is a very good app, but it doesn't quite meet my needs. I canceled my account, but they kept charging me for months. I finally got through to their customer service, and they refunded all my money. I have adjusted my review to reflect this. Otherwise, this app is well thought out and worth trying.;1
Absolutely amazing. A simple design that allows you to organize your task into a list that you can format however you want, and see on your phone, computer, or Android Wear. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the syncing between devices is a little bit inconvenient. Often, I would make changes to my tasklist on my phone, and they would not show up on computer until I went back into the app and manually refreshed it.;1
This app is amazing! Very convenient to be honest. Everything is just there for u to setup, the interface looks simple but great, especially the dark theme. I love it. One main thing about this app is that the premium section of it does not overwhelm the user. It's there but it doesn't shovel itself to the users face. Compared to the others I've used this is a better deal.;1
No doubt it’s the best productivity app. It is very smooth and customizable. I liked the idea of adding a Pomo Timer & Habit tracker. Having all this features made this app unique & amazing. But the prize of the premium package is little high, that's why i'm not gonna give you 5 Stars. Anyway, it’s a great app 🔥;1
I loved this app, but I have been a premium member for months, but today right after Google play sent me a receipt for June, the app tells me I need to upgrade to premium. What gives, Tick tick? I'll be happy to change my rating if you can restore my premium membership. Update: got an answer on Twitter sort of: had to figure out myself where restore purchase was, but once I clicked it, I was premium again!;1
I really like it. The reason I'm giving a 4 star is that I wish the focus promo could be set for more than 120 mins. 120 mins means I've got to keep changing it againg and againg for longer focus periods which breaks the focus. P.s. I'm using the free version. I don't know whether it available on the premium version or not.;1
Pros: I like the design overall. Reminders work well. I think the black theme is great for reducing eye strain. Cons: The search feature is lacking - if I search a single word, it may return tasks with that word in the details before tasks with that word in the title (which I would expect to see first). Task in multiple tags don't always display as expected. Can't 'select all' or 'select all by tag' to batch postpone/schedule. Can't see total # of tasks in a day selected in calendar view.;1
I'm not sure if this is something you can fix but since my Samsung phone got the Android 10 update, the widgets are very small. So many great features! Very flexible with lists, auto lists and tags. Different ways to view and sort your tasks, a great calendar view that also allows you to just see your events in the background. Really like the pomo timer with white noise as well. Great to have also have habit tracking in the same app. Just switched from monthly to yearly premium subscription.;1
"Update - Merging two tasks vanished both of them. Tried again, same result. Great App. Recommend/ Request : In Location reminders, couldn't find a way to switch the map 🗺 to Satellite 🛰 view. If it's absent, kindly add it as it is very essential to mark most locations. If I missed it, kindly 👉 me.";1
I love this app so far has everything I've ever wanted. The only thing I could use is an actual working persistent wear notification, and I'd love to see an auto scheduler where you enter duration and the default start time is the end of you last timed task for the day or into the next empty space. That would take ticktick over the top to 5 stars!;1
Very very very good program, it provides to me all/most what i need to Manage My Aims & Planing for my dreams..📊📃 It also Enhance my productivity along the time bec. it has a full view about my own time [Days, Weeks, Months, Years] 📆 I'd like to purchase the program Premium Plan in the future if i started to use it almost.😊💳;1
Great all around GTD, Tasks, Reminder. A few that I would like to to see added: 1) add location icon WHEN setting a reminder. 2) In calendar view, a better view showing of the difference between a task and a calendar event. 3) a dedicated shortcut (activities) or widget to add a task by voice.;1
"Great. Better than todoist cause you can organize how you want in inbox or ""all"" view, despite priority or reminder time. That option is what sets it above. Wish that android reminders were full screen, however or that snooze reminders could be optionabke for time. View in website and windows app also could be draggable for left to right sizing of columns";1
It's really good app... I have been using it for few days... Really helpful... Just one thing... When I add a new task it shows up on the top of existing tasks... Can I change the settings so that it will appear at the bottom? That's why given 4 stars...;1
This app has even GREATER potential - better than most others. But development is slow and issues are not dealt with efficiently. At least some of the more critical items are more stable!;1
This seems to tick (ha!) most of the boxes, multiple to do lists, habit tracking, Pomodoro timer. The only place I wish it were better is in statistics and graphs of habit and to do completion;1
I loved the app so much . It is amazing and helps me a lot organize my ideas.. I think if it had the option to put our tasks in order and the option of setting timer it would be very organized and irreplaceable.;1
Good app but the second habit reminder never procs for me, example I have a habit for meds at 8am and 8pm but the 8pm notification doesn't work. Maybe I'm doing something wrong? I could create a second habit but I was wondering if this could be done on just one.;1
Just what I was looking for! Simple lightweight app that syncs my to-do lists a between Android, Windows & Mac. Very nice.;1
I actually tried a lot of apps, and after 1 year with Asana, I switched TickTick. Only 4 stars because the app neither fully supports syncing to Google Calendar, nor does it display the calendar events with the colors which were set in the calendar.;1
Great app, most of the features with reasonable limitations are available in the free plan already. Pomo sometimes doesn't work though, the timer just gets stuck at 25:00 after it starts;1
Love this app. Would like to say thanks for creating this app. Three star only because calendar is bit buggy. One is there are no real time syncing with google calendar which force me to use Ticktick's calendar which is not convenient for me.;1
Routine tasks if not finished are shown as an overdue....!! Please give an option to auto mark any specific routine tasks as incomplete rather than overdue....!!;1
The app suddenly downgraded my subscription plan to free. Yet payment has already been taken! Confirmed. No response from devs. Update: Dev has now responded and account has been restored.;1
this was a great tick of thing to get i am more organized now insted of just have paper to do lists i got a digital one this great and think every one shound have it tho at times it can get hard to know how to do stuff but later on you get a hang of it.i love it;1
Great app, only thing is that now the Focus Timer is not working, you should go and check it. Thanks for that beautiful productivity tool.💕;1
A great app for making tasks. But, if you could add the alarm system and planning the schedule for free users, then it would be really nice....;1
Some things should be made easier like typing in the tasks one after the other easily without having to press 'Save and New' everytime.;1
I like the design and the flow, I just don't like how some features require premium, but j guess that's how they make their money so i understand.;1
Sir your app is so great, its alarm to remind you about schedule is great and timer..i wonder you can add the timer feature to count the no of hours you study during a day etc..like that;1
Pretty good app. Helps get things done. Easy to use. No issues yet.;1
I love this app. Only thing that annoys me is how marking a task as complete in one device doesn't dismiss notifications on the others. :(;1
Helpful! The app is amazing. Only thing - I wish there were more habits that I could stock up in the free version.;1
I loved this app so much. Though the notifications doesn't work if you're not online, but overall, it's the best To-do list app i've used.;1
This app is great. Really nice for organizing stuff. Only thing I miss is a monthly overview with statistics.;1
Would be better to enter multiple tasks quickly instead of having to add new task each time. Overall good app and close replacement for Wunderlist;1
Great app! Awesome UI and UX. But a minor problem as alarms or notifications don't work when the app is not running in background.;1
It is a nice app and really helps me manage my tasks especially study tasks....it should also include features like sharing schedule with friends .;1
I like the fact that you can put some tasks for everyday , and you can classify the tasks by list but I would rather if it can give me my productivity rate after every week / month based on the number of tasks completed;1
Looks really good, but unfortunately couldn't get to set a customized template...;1
Hey! Even after Optimizing for battery optimization, I still get reminders only after I start the app. Please help ?;1
Works great. I enjoy having it available on my phone and on my work computer.;1
Easy n accurate....user friendly app. Voice to text funtion is also very helpful.;1
It is best from others because its features are different n suitable for everyone. Its graph representation of daily tasks is amazing🌟🌟🌟🌟;1
Best todo app. But can't set timeout for overdue items. It's good if we can insert emoji or icons.;1
It could make some more features available for free versions,so it would be the better.;1
It is good but could be so much better with full Google Assistant integration...;1
Like this app. It had everything I expected a ToDo list to do so I have no complaints.;1
Good but is there a one time fee for this thing? I abhor having to pay $2.99/month vs just paying a one time fee..;1
It's a good app ,it has everything which a study app require or more...but only it doesn't have ranking system....;1
Just what I needed! Would give 5 if it had time tracker.;1
Liking it: i would maybe like some more backgrounds eg my own pic background would be nice;1
Very good app to keep everything organized.;1
So as far as to-do lists are concerned, this is (imo) the best you can have. The free version in and of itself is so good with it's tasks and subtasks and reminders etc. The paid version gives you a calendar which is very intuitive and simple. The only problem I have with tick tick is that I want instant syncing. So instant that when I tick off a task in the phone, it should instantly reflect in the pc. And for some inexplicable reason, that's not there yet. But I'm sure it should be added soon.;1
Great app 👍 could you please add the option to view habits on the tommorow list.;1
I wished that all of the features are consistent on all of the platforms. I'm trying to avoid using my phone so much, so I would often use ticktick on my computer. But each platform has slightly different features which is such a put off because I have to keep pulling out my phone just to be able to use the full features of the app.;1
I love this app. I like having a habit tracker and to-do list that is easy to use. But I think the tasks that are repeated on a daily basis, should be completely hidden once they're done, so they can reappear the next day. The app at least knows the task is completed, but because it doesn't really disappears, the number of tasks (even though they're for the next day) is annoying.;1
It gives notification on time which mostly apps don't give.;1
TickTick is very helpful. I like the various repetition options, especially being able to choose a set time span after completion rather than a rigid every month type schedule. The only downside we have found is that there is sometimes a syncing error between devices.;1
For habits statistics please add graphics of weeks and months progression;1
The best app for tasks so far. Some features are still missing for me tho. For example a shortcut from the app icon, to create new task right away. The app, however, makes up for it through the level of customizability it offers. I'm more than happy with it.;1
✔️This App has all the features and customisation required in a Task Mgmt app. And the developer is proactive. ❌ What freaks me is doubts about data security as the company is based out of Hong Kong.;1
I'm using this app every day and I'm really impressed. I've tried many trackers for Android and that's the only one that meets my needs. It's simple, looks nice and highly customizable. I love the habit tracking system with reminders and flexible time goals. The only problem for me is a habit limit. I'm not gonna pay that much for a premium version because I don't need like 90% of the features. I would love to see other, lower paid plans or option to buy just specific features.;1
Ever since I downloaded this app, I've gotten less lazy, I've done more work, and I was able to keep track of my tasks needed. I would rate 5/5 stars, but I would like this app to have compatibility on windows or have some sort of chrome extension. If I am mistaken and there is a windows/chrome extension, please notify me. Thank you.;1
Love the ability to create tags, it's huge for allowing one item to be part of several categories or lists. Example I have a 15min tag to easily find tasks I can do when I just have a few min. Also 3 priority levels. It's quick & intuitive & great layout. Only complaint is it doesn't fully sync with Google Calendar, you can SHARE it as a webcal but Google can take 24hrs to import it. There is a workaround for it though. Overall loving the app. Will likely go for Pro version but free has plenty;1
I was so pleased with the new Habit tracker as well as using a true Dark Mode. However, I don't agree with the Premium policy as I prefer to make a bigger one-time payment (such as when I bought Final Cut Pro X with Apple) instead of a small recurring subscription that makes me want to go back to Todoist. It's a damn shame as I liked TickTick so much I'm willing to pay for Premium. Unfortunately, the subscription policy is an easy deal breaker.;1
Pros: this app is very similar to the functionality of Wunderlist and adds features I wanted. Free version is fully functional except for the limitation of 9 lists Cons: Some of the widget buttons are small and I am not a fan of subscription services for premium features (I would pay a one-time fee, even for each upgrade, but i absolutely won't subscribe);1
"Huge amount of functionality in free version. stopped short of 5* because duplicate functionality v limited. When i duplicate tasks I cannot duplicate to any other location than current one and cannot change name, and the new name is set as old name plus ""copied"". Would be very helpful to have duplication functionality that I can copy tasks (or indeed a whole list) and on copying them can have the duplicates placed where I wish and make choice about naming convention";1
Love TickTick, it's almost perfect! I'd love to see the following features added: • Subtasks within subtasks (like todoists) • Option to assign repeating tasks to repeat after completion rather than due date. (I have an automatic cat feeder that lasts five days then I need to be reminded, but if I postpone a day or two and then check it off it sets to repeat five days after the original due date instead of after I check off) • Option to configure inbox behavior (include tasks from other lists);1
I tried it all anydo premium, todoist, Microsoft Todo, Google task, google calendar u name it. This blows everyone out if the water. Best Todo app you can have for habits, calender, Todo any timing ur tasks. This is truly an all in one task manager with natural language. Although it's not strong for natural language, it's feature richness and the ease of use is unpar. It's still fresh so expect few bugs here and there hence the 4 star rating. All in all tick tick is the king of productivity!;1
Excellent Calender Supplement! - I've been using TickTick along side my long term Callander (Google Calender) as a planner for my daily tasks and University Timetable. And it's been nothing short of amazing, life changing might sound like a stretch but it's helped me a tonne when it comes to getting stuffz done. - Only thing I'd ask for is more options or a separate way of planning things like a university timetable to make it faster to add classes etc.;1
Very happy with this having been abandoned by Wunderlist. I would give 5 stars if you could move multiple items on a list at the same time. Would make organizing list a breeze.;1
TickTick looks like a powerful and flexible productivity app but I find the help and support information across platforms somewhat overwhelming and confusing. I think that (for the easily confused) it would benefit from a good tidy-up, beginning with a clear conceptual overview of the design philosophy and architecture of the product and the methodology of its use, including flow diagrams and examples, before any specific platform advice.;1
Some lag in sync but otherwise good;1
Not bad It's a basic to-do list which establishes days when a project is to be completed and a list of tasks that were uncompleted. Uncomplicated and useful. I would like to see the option that shows a job partially completed... some projects need to be held over and a more customisable repeat process ... every fortnight, or third Friday of the week.;1
Great so far, the Wunderlist import saved me a lot of time. I'm trying to get used to no having the list of lists show when opened. I think I'm gonna miss that. I do like that is not task/productivity focused. Most competitors put those features foremost. I like that here they're available but not prominent;1
Works pretty well, but limits you to 9 lists unless you're playing a subscription. (I'm here for the lists and nothing else.) I'd give them some money if it was a one time fee(s) to increase the amount of lists, but I'm not paying monthly for that.;1
This is a GREAT ap. It is easy and intuitive to use. Only 4 stars because you can't trust it with repetitive tasks. It nearly always skips the next occurrence when you mark one occurrence complete. Doesn't matter what ghee frequency is. I have submitted feedback twice, 4 & 5 months ago.;1
Great app, but annoying that it limits the number of lists you can make. I can understand limiting *shared* lists on the free version, but not regular ones. Functionally it's great though. I would pay a one time fee to open the pro functions, but not ongoing fees.;1
Extremely user-friendly app that keeps me organized.;1
The app is very good. It can handle all of my reminders and daily habits. There is a bug tho. When I try to complete my habits or swipe them away in the notification center, my entire phone freezes up for a few seconds. Other than that, its perfect.;1
The free version is good. Will upgrade to pro soon. Tick Tick is lacking video tutorials online. It looks much more capable than I'm able to figure out. Looking for a todo app that can share lists with others without needing to build a database.;1
Has been a good experience using the app across platforms (have tried it across iOS, android and web app). The web app is especially powerful with progress charts and kanban views built in. Two issues i'd like to bring to the notice of the developers, 1. Reminders snoozed in one platform do not sync reliably on the others 2. The web app often displays multiple reminder windows for the same item.;1
"Wishes: Yesterday's undone tasks would automatically move to today. Drag & drop tasks to a new day on calendar to reschedule. Tasks' checkbox matched the list's color to see which list they belong to from a glance. I restructured it to use the priority markings to indicate lists (ie: to do at work is all yellow, to do at home is blue, errands red) Priority tags are pointless, just arrange the list w. high priority items on top. Habits need ""No more than X"" tracking. ie ""No more than 2 naps/day""";1
The app is really amazing but, the remainder doesn't work properly instead I have to track all my task and sometimes because of this it gets missed out.;1
Good, but I can't figure out some things. Like I'd rather have undated things listed above my next yearly reminders that don't happen for another year.;1
Really nice but need some more changes;1
Really great, like the pomo. If the completed tasks can be rearraged in a different order instead of being defaulted as follow an alphabetical order that'll be perfect;1
Great addition to having a calendar. I can set text reminders for To Dos from here so I don't have to clutter my family's digital calendar with details for my days. Took a while to get how the app and folders work, but I have a good system set up now.;1
Your get what you put into it. It has a good tutorial that lets you understand how to set reminder times and other settings. I switched from having my calendar full of reminder events to this and my calendar looks a lot cleaner now with this giving me my reminders in the background;1
"Super easy to learn, utilize, and phenomenal at keeping me in track moving forward. I've tried a TON of apps for this. I didn't find this until I saw it was part of a ""Top 10 Most Productive Apps"" list.";1
Nice app. Easy to use interface with a lot of useful features such as categorization of tasks, reminder settings and frequency. Has dark mode in the free version. Have been using since a month and no noticeable bug found.;1
Pretty good. Some bugs.;1
My all around power app! This app has been so useful, that I use it not just for tasks but also my calendar. Used to sync with Google calendar, but left that to be all Ticktick now. This app is right on the money.;1
Good replacement for Wunderlist. Free version suits my needs. Price of upgrade puts me off and prevents 5 star rating.;1
It is very good app to manage your to do list. One thing that can make it better is it should show all the incomplete or overdue taks with todays tasks as overdue instead of into inbox. This will make those task more accessible and will keep them under notice.;1
Great app with good functionality in the widgets. I would love to see a way to track my progress in the Daily view of the widget similar to the horizontal bar that already exists in the app when it runs not as a widget.;1
"I didn't understand how to add subtask in ""template"". I pressed ""save as template"", but it saved only the name of template. I couldn't find any information about template in ""help centre"". Please explain me how to add subtask in template.";1
"I'm a ""to-do"" list kinda person, I rely pretty heavily on them because my memory is 👎 I like that this syncs with my Google calendar. I also like the satisfying little sound when I check a little box to mark a task complete (what can I say? It's the simple things in life 💁‍♀️). I especially like that I can schedule tasks and reminders waaaaay the heck ahead of time. Would've given 5 stars, but honestly, I'd really like a little more text options (fonts, colors, etc).";1
I noticed a slight anomaly in the app. If you start focus for a subtask e.g. SubtaskX of TaskX, then why isn't that focus time added to the total time of TaskX? That SubtaskX does fall under the TaskX, so any time invested in SubTaskX should also be added into the main TaskX otherwise it defeats the whole purpose of SubTaskX if it is independent of the TaskX. I hope you will 'focus' on this issue. Thanks.;1
So far it does what I need;1
For habits statistics please add graphics of weeks and months progression;1
The latest update has a bug, when holding the top task to drag it down it won't let me do it. I can drag any task but not the first one.;1
Good;1
Just what I was looking for! Simple lightweight app that syncs my to-do lists a between Android, Windows & Mac. Very nice.;1
Great app 👍 could you please add the option to view habits on the tommorow list.;1
Achchha app hai magar kabhi kabhi dikkat aati hai.. usse fix karna jaruri hai;1
Some lag in sync but otherwise good;1
Pretty good good app. Does what I need it to do.;1
Routine tasks if not finished are shown as an overdue....!! Please give an option to auto mark any specific routine tasks as incomplete rather than overdue....!!;1
Works great. I enjoy having it available on my phone and on my work computer.;1
Bring the Gantt view;1
This app has even GREATER potential - better than most others. But development is slow and issues are not dealt with efficiently. At least some of the more critical items are more stable!;1
This seems to tick (ha!) most of the boxes, multiple to do lists, habit tracking, Pomodoro timer. The only place I wish it were better is in statistics and graphs of habit and to do completion;1
That is really useful for me. I can use it for many plan and to do things and doing chores and ... . If U can add note (for writing notes and ...) And something like goal planner and program manager it will be more useful than now. TNX;1
It's amazing apart from the fact that it reminds me of you events from yesterday.;1
Very very very good program, it provides to me all/most what i need to Manage My Aims & Planing for my dreams..📊📃 It also Enhance my productivity along the time bec. it has a full view about my own time [Days, Weeks, Months, Years] 📆 I'd like to purchase the program Premium Plan in the future if i started to use it almost.😊💳;1
Good, few tweaks to be great;1
It is need to support Arabic language;1
Pretty good app. Helps get things done. Easy to use. No issues yet.;1
Pretty good.;1
It could make some more features available for free versions,so it would be the better.;1
Very good app;1
This app was really good So Far this is the best app I used to stay on track BUT I hate it when I need to pay for premium. Please make it free?;1
No doubt it’s the best productivity app. It is very smooth and customizable. I liked the idea of adding a Pomo Timer & Habit tracker. Having all this features made this app unique & amazing. But the prize of the premium package is little high, that's why i'm not gonna give you 5 Stars. Anyway, it’s a great app 🔥;1
I downloaded this app and I didn't expect much but its honestly amazing! I love the simple layout and everything about it. I love that you can add or delete tools like for me, I wanted to have a habit tracker and I could simply enable that. I can clearly see why it is editors choice! Recommend it to everyone! ❤ Edit: You can only do 5 habits with subscription sadly.;1
Terimakasih sudah membantu;1
TickTick provided me with one of the best experiences I should be having to dos, reminders and do it everywhere whether I'm at web on my Mac or desktop in windows or travelling with my Android. Dark mode and offerings if color shades works best alongside cross platform sync of data. I hope DEVs will improve more like notification for important forgotten work so that i can rate it 5. Also add notes feature or standalone as cross platform app like keep or notes. 👍👍👍;1
Easy n accurate....user friendly app. Voice to text funtion is also very helpful.;1
Good, but I can't figure out some things. Like I'd rather have undated things listed above my next yearly reminders that don't happen for another year.;1
Good little to do app, but, how can you activate the sync feature ??;1
This app is almost perfect and a league above the others. However there is one thing missing and it is the ability to have repetitive tasks. Suppose I want to grow the habit of brushing my teeth every night, I don't want to keep creating the same tak every day. So the ability to have daily tasks. This app is still the best and much better than its competitors.;1
This is a very good app, but it doesn't quite meet my needs. I canceled my account, but they kept charging me for months. I finally got through to their customer service, and they refunded all my money. I have adjusted my review to reflect this. Otherwise, this app is well thought out and worth trying.;1
Some things should be made easier like typing in the tasks one after the other easily without having to press 'Save and New' everytime.;1
Helps me accomplish my tasks;1
✔️This App has all the features and customisation required in a Task Mgmt app. And the developer is proactive. ❌ What freaks me is doubts about data security as the company is based out of Hong Kong.;1
Great all around GTD, Tasks, Reminder. A few that I would like to to see added: 1) add location icon WHEN setting a reminder. 2) In calendar view, a better view showing of the difference between a task and a calendar event. 3) a dedicated shortcut (activities) or widget to add a task by voice.;1
Pretty good. Some bugs.;1
Sir your app is so great, its alarm to remind you about schedule is great and timer..i wonder you can add the timer feature to count the no of hours you study during a day etc..like that;1
Good;1
It's a good app ,it has everything which a study app require or more...but only it doesn't have ranking system....;1
so simple and user friendly;1
Godd;1
Very good;1
So far so good;1
I'm not sure if this is something you can fix but since my Samsung phone got the Android 10 update, the widgets are very small. So many great features! Very flexible with lists, auto lists and tags. Different ways to view and sort your tasks, a great calendar view that also allows you to just see your events in the background. Really like the pomo timer with white noise as well. Great to have also have habit tracking in the same app. Just switched from monthly to yearly premium subscription.;1
Good app to keep track of the to-do list;1
It is a fun appp.;1
A very cool program. We want Arabic.;1
Ok;1
Does this app have auto sync with Google account?;1
Really well done, and fills the void Wunderlist left. Thank you for this app and thank you for making it free.;1
This works very well!! Awesome app.;1
I loved the app so much . It is amazing and helps me a lot organize my ideas.. I think if it had the option to put our tasks in order and the option of setting timer it would be very organized and irreplaceable.;1
Good but some more ease is needed;1
The widget is quite imlressive;1
5.7.1: Habits widget improved but lacking. NEEDS ALSO SINGLE COLUMN LAYOUT for habits widget. THE GOOD: 1. SOME offline. 2. Habits. 3. Pomo timer. 4. Dark theme. 5. Sorting lists (only Paid). THE BAD: 1. Too expensive to use basic features. Make it $10 lifetime. 2. Social aspect sucks. Needs public leaderboard (OPEN to free users) & search find & add users. 3. Limited export feature. Use Titanium Backup. Share option ok but only one list, need full backup export all. 4. Need 100% offline mode;1
Just what I needed! Would give 5 if it had time tracker.;1
I've been using TickTick for probably 4 years, and it's the best to-do list app out there. It's simple and straightforward, and I love that I can have it on all of my devices and computer, and keep one to do list wherever I go. I would love to give it 5 stars, but over the last few months it's been very glitchy with syncing between my various devices.;1
I definitely recommend it.;1
"Great. Better than todoist cause you can organize how you want in inbox or ""all"" view, despite priority or reminder time. That option is what sets it above. Wish that android reminders were full screen, however or that snooze reminders could be optionabke for time. View in website and windows app also could be draggable for left to right sizing of columns";1
Great app but I would like to see ToDo's within ToDo's. I mean like, When u click a ToDo, it should open more sub-ToDo's. Then I surely give you 5 stars;1
good;1
Nice app;1
It's user friendly... love using it..;1
Like this app. It had everything I expected a ToDo list to do so I have no complaints.;1
It gives notification on time which mostly apps don't give.;1
Good;1
nice;1
Love this app. Would like to say thanks for creating this app. Three star only because calendar is bit buggy. One is there are no real time syncing with google calendar which force me to use Ticktick's calendar which is not convenient for me.;1
Better than others but I have problem in the beginning, I'll let you know later...;1
I loved this app so much. Though the notifications doesn't work if you're not online, but overall, it's the best To-do list app i've used.;1
Hey! Even after Optimizing for battery optimization, I still get reminders only after I start the app. Please help ?;1
So far, felt good.;1
I like the design and the flow, I just don't like how some features require premium, but j guess that's how they make their money so i understand.;1
Good fun ... Motivated;1
Great app and experience all the features are great.;1
It's really good app... I have been using it for few days... Really helpful... Just one thing... When I add a new task it shows up on the top of existing tasks... Can I change the settings so that it will appear at the bottom? That's why given 4 stars...;1
Good;1
This app is amazing! Very convenient to be honest. Everything is just there for u to setup, the interface looks simple but great, especially the dark theme. I love it. One main thing about this app is that the premium section of it does not overwhelm the user. It's there but it doesn't shovel itself to the users face. Compared to the others I've used this is a better deal.;1
I really like it. The reason I'm giving a 4 star is that I wish the focus promo could be set for more than 120 mins. 120 mins means I've got to keep changing it againg and againg for longer focus periods which breaks the focus. P.s. I'm using the free version. I don't know whether it available on the premium version or not.;1
Great app, most of the features with reasonable limitations are available in the free plan already. Pomo sometimes doesn't work though, the timer just gets stuck at 25:00 after it starts;1
It is a nice app and really helps me manage my tasks especially study tasks....it should also include features like sharing schedule with friends .;1
This app is great. Really nice for organizing stuff. Only thing I miss is a monthly overview with statistics.;1
A great app for making tasks. But, if you could add the alarm system and planning the schedule for free users, then it would be really nice....;1
Really nice but need some more changes;1
I love this app. Only thing that annoys me is how marking a task as complete in one device doesn't dismiss notifications on the others. :(;1
Good but is there a one time fee for this thing? I abhor having to pay $2.99/month vs just paying a one time fee..;1
Very good app for time management;1
Excellent app.;1
Looks really good, but unfortunately couldn't get to set a customized template...;1
Tick Tick is good but it should add more ring tones please try;1
Good;1
I actually tried a lot of apps, and after 1 year with Asana, I switched TickTick. Only 4 stars because the app neither fully supports syncing to Google Calendar, nor does it display the calendar events with the colors which were set in the calendar.;1
this was a great tick of thing to get i am more organized now insted of just have paper to do lists i got a digital one this great and think every one shound have it tho at times it can get hard to know how to do stuff but later on you get a hang of it.i love it;1
It is good but could be so much better with full Google Assistant integration...;1
Absolutely amazing. A simple design that allows you to organize your task into a list that you can format however you want, and see on your phone, computer, or Android Wear. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the syncing between devices is a little bit inconvenient. Often, I would make changes to my tasklist on my phone, and they would not show up on computer until I went back into the app and manually refreshed it.;1
I like the fact that you can put some tasks for everyday , and you can classify the tasks by list but I would rather if it can give me my productivity rate after every week / month based on the number of tasks completed;1
This is the overall best app that I have found for manging the things I need to do. I have downloaded 50 of the Google play stores highest rated to-do/task planner apps and nothing has come close to TickTick. The best quality of the app is the interface. 6 months ago i paid for one year subscription of the to do planner app 'any.do' and was using that until I found TickTick. I left an app i paid for to use this - which is free but can be upgraded to premium, which I plan to do.;1
I installed every todo list app and I was unsatisfied. Most of them were not offering widget facility. But this app is all-in-one. You can collaborate with other apps as well, make to do lists, set alarms, make folders, set priorities, label your tasks and many more. This app is keeping me busy. Now, I love to do my tasks to update my list everyday.;1
Tick Tick is great. My daughter recommended it to me. She likes the natural language option. I love the option to create habits out of recurring to do tasks, that's important for me, as I'm using Tick Tick in part to try to put my life back together after my husband's death. It's very helpful to have a checklist and form habits that are little in the moment but cumulatively make a big difference. Still trying to figure out how to not have a date for a list item though (for book/grocery lists).;1
Like it. Notifications & popups are great for constant reminders! They are cute & look nice as well! Helps keep me focused on what I need to be. Only thing that I would reccomend for others who install, would be: Its tempting to make many reminders because they're so great, but, if you make more than a few at a time, they pop up constantly & become an annoyance, & easily ignored. Focus on just a few reminders, then, when they become HABITS, take them off and put up new goals.🤠;1
Best tasklist app I've ever used -- and trust me, I've been through a few. Ticktick literally has everything one could wish for when it comes to GTD -- habits, calendar, even Pomodoro timing(!) -- merged into one. single. app. My one complain is that while you can start Pomodoros for a task/habit/etc., you can't actually tag them afterwards. That would be rather useful, I think. It would allow me to see how much time I've spent doing different tasks that all fall within the same project.;1
This is a very good and unique app. I really like how I am able to put different types of events or plans I want to jot down. How I'm able to put a tab when it's important or a personal matter. Good notifications as well, right on time. Overall, a great app. I'm glad I came across this app, it has helped me be more organized and top of things.;1
Been using for a little over a week and I really enjoy this experience. Traditional to-do list functionality combined with a habit tracker and pomodoro timer really hits all the marks I need from a productivity app. My only complaints are the lack of certain functionality for the Mac app, but on Android you're knocking it out of the park.;1
I regret not being able to offer more than five stars. After trying every app there is my search is over now. It has everything kanban, lists, subtasks, habit tracking, pomorodo and reminders (though reminders are not working in android, but on pc it is great). I hope you guys will provide a sneak peak into calendar feature for free users too. Only thing missing is gnatt chart feature.;1
This is so far the best productivity app I've used. It has everything I need - to-do list, kanban, calendar, pomodoro, habit tracker. I used to use a few apps to have all these features, but now I just use this app. Would be nice though if I can tag and group habits, too. Also, is the habits feature accessible in the desktop version? I haven't figured it out.;1
Amazing app. This really really helps me to increase my productivity, and to keep a note of the things which I need to do. And thank you so much for the cross platform support, I can access my tasks over my pc or anywhere I want. This app solved several problems of mine;1
Hands down the best todo list / planner app available right now. The free version is more than enough to handle most people's task load. Only when you start to hyper-organize with different sets of lists and categories do you really *need* to get the pro version. And once you get to that level, the $3/mo is well worth the productivity gained.;1
Its the best To-do list app there is on play store! I have tried almost all the highly rated todo list and planner apps on play store, so far this one stands out. It has all the features one can feel required. Must give it a try. Also it gives lot of features in its unpaid version itself, which is pretty cool!;1
I've tried pretty much every to-do app out there, and this is by far the best. Not only does it have all of the basics that you'd expect from a to-do app, it also looks great, and has loads of useful extra features like letting you choose long press home screen shortcuts, menu customisation, and even a habit tracker. The features you get without upgrading to premium are all pretty reasonable too, aside from the limit on trackable habits, but the upgrade to premium doesn't cost all that much.;1
Still exploring the features but excellent and by far the best of the todos I've looked at. Addendum: having been using the app for a few months now, I can thoroughly recommend. Does everything that I need. PS. I 've been using for more than a year now. Would not be without it.;1
Rich app, versatile features. Most valuable features for me: kanban board, pomodoro timer. These rick! What could be improved: - Calendar view has only 1 mode (today). It's better to have at least several views (3 days, 5 days, week etc) - today view: add calendar on the right panel. Enable tasks drag&drop to the calendar- will be awesome. Check how leadertask app implemented it. - it would be awesome to have a desktop app for this one! Much more convenient than some tab in Chrome. - add more p;1
I used Wunderlist for 5 years and when the app stopped working I had a hard time finding something alike. I am VERY happy with TickTick. It does make my life a lot easier! All the reminders it gives you and to-do's on daily basis, there is even grocery shopping list! I can only recommend it! Love it! ♡;1
This is probably the best productivity app I've ever tried. It is very complete, and everything I'm looking for, TickTick has them. And the features are very customizable. The sound it has when we accomplish our to do list feels very rewarding too. You can tell that the people behind this app listen to the customers and always try to provide our needs for a better, organized life. They put their heart on working on this app. Also the paid version is affordable. I'm thankful. Pls stay this way💚;1
This is exactly what I've been searching for. I switched from Skedpal which was close but a little clunky. This has calendar view with time blocking and gcal integration and is super easy and quick to add new tasks without many steps. Now that I can add tasks quickly from my gsuite inbox it's almost prefect.;1
Love this app and everything it offers (keeping track of tasks, calendar, pomodoro, habit tracking, statistics) - so versatile and intuitive, looks amazing and straight up the only thing keeping my life together right now! I pretty much bought premium immediately and intend to keep doing so. Thank you so so so much for this app!! :);1
Keeps me well focused. There's still so much scope for improvement. But I love this app. P.S. The timer doesn't always show a countdown. :( Great app. No doubt. Loved the new update done to the promo timer. The focus thingy is dope. Not very comfortable with the statistics part though. The old pattern was very comfy and neat. The new ones very hard to get adjusted to. Hopefully the design team will take note of this and do something soon??;1
No problems with it! Love the calendar integration, voice input, sync with desktop. 2020 update: This is my favorite app and it keeps getting better. The widgets are really useful, as are the custom filtered lists. I have ADHD, and usually forget a lot, but I put literally everything I want to remember in this app: tasks, appointments, movie recommendations. It's easy to sort and tag all everything I put in the app, and I love that it works with my laptop and web browser as well!;1
This product has really come a long way since I tried it in 2019. Best Android task mgr app with really clean interface and great widgets. Syncs almost immediately with web and Windows apps. Windows app includes multiple drop down widgets so you can view / edit tasks anywhere within Windows. Support has improved substantially and is generally responsive. For solo users, TickTick beats all the higher priced apps hands down. Have not tried it for teams, but it's really targeted for solo users.;1
I think i found my perfect to do app! I'm pleased that I was able to use the same features I was using from an old app and do it on this one, plus more! It's so easy to organize and visualize all your tasks. The appearance of the app overall is excellent.;1
SO happy to find this app! Works great for everything it says it does, reminders ACTUALLY WORK unlike the other todo apps I tested out & the NLP makes adding tasks really quick & easy! (my fave feature I've been seeking since Wunderlist died, along with smooth/simple design & reminders & comments). TickTick has all the features I wanted + extras like tags, urgency ratings & a unique integration of Pomo technique! which I've never been able to stick to in past, but am now loving! Great app devs!!;1
Very good app for todos list and time management. I would say it is an all purpose app for those who are looking to organise their tasks in a time effective manner. Could not find any glitches. I would say it is the perfect app I have come so far..;1
This todo list app definately stanfs above the almost the same todo_wonderlist_tasks type of app. I love its flexibility to make your own processes, love the integration of other calendars, love the preset lists, and most importantly i love the widget! I can make a todo list widget on one screen, and my shopping list widget on the other. Plus I can make each lines super tight to see the list without to constantly scrolling up and down. Great app.;1
Used Todoist for 5 years. Switched to Ticktick this year when my premium subscription ran out. I should have done it sooner. Ticktick is the best productivity app I've used. The interface is simple and focused. The calendar implementation is spot on and the reminders work very well. Will continue to use and recommend.;1
Amazing app, i absolutely love it! Although it is rather sad that we - the hungry and poor students who have no means of making use of all the utilities that the paid version has to offer, and so we are somewhat limited... but we understand that you need to make money somehow as well, so you dont have to be hungry like us :D still, totally incredible app, the best umong those ive tried(and ive tried a lot, trust me) so yeah, keep up :D;1
Suuuper helpful with school and I still use it for daily life in general. It's really clean and works better than anything else I've tried. The only things I'd change would be making the widget able to be pulled down a little more and being able to choose custom colors for the priority feature.;1
It has everything I want. Grouping, but seeing them together, being flexible in ordering them, giving priorities, and the use of colours. The only improvement I would see is that those colours on the left are very small. I would love to see them better. Otherwise great app!;1
I really love this app! It has all the functions I need to effectively remind me of the things I should accomplish. As an android user, I was able to also add a widget next to my home screen where I can add additional tasks or cross some off my list hassle-free. Props to the developer of this app!;1
It's 5 years ago since I first used this app. Its been sat doing nothing on an old tablet I no longer use. Luckily when I recently downloaded it to my phone I found my log in details and was able to access all my long forgotten stuff. Plus it's had loads of new developments since I've been gone. It's brill, just what I wanted in a to-do list and lots more besides. If I keep regularly using it I might even subscribe for even more features.;1
"3. An option to arrange the tags alphabetically would be really helpful. An ""auto arrange"" would also work. Also, a password/pin lock with a Fingerprint locking facility. Thanks! 2. Love the new colors! Thanks for including them guys. 1. After a lot of contemplation, I decided to buy this app. On the whole, it's a great app. Tasks, calenders, tags, folders. Pretty much, all that one could ask for. I've used GTasks since ages. Just needed more options in an app and this fits the bill perfectly.";1
Very recommended! I'm a student and use TickTick all the time. Even without the premium features (which are very cheap and make the experience much better), this app WILL help you manage your tasks and your time. It's very intuitive and easy to use and you can sync it with your computer, which makes you even more productive. I've been actively using TickTick for quite some time now with the premium membership... Can't say a single negative thing about it;1
This app is really good as all the other reviews already state - but why can't you see the last 7 days overview in the habit tab? It's there in the desktop app but not on Android. You only see the total days count which is rather insignificant for habits. It would be good if you could see the last 7 days of all your habits in an overview and be able to tick them off quickly in the same window. Also the smart day recognition only seems to work when you add new tasks. Not when you want to edit it;1
I looove this app. I'm so so happy i stumbled upon it . It has all the features i ever wanted . All in one . Calendar, habit tracker with nice interface and suggestions, daily to do lists . With the ability to create different lists . The ability to move a task to different day. The dark mode is beautiful.THE WIDGETS😍The reminders also. The pomodore timer as well!! Wow. And all this is free!! I love love how simple n minimal and effective this app is. I'll delete the other apps n stick to it💖;1
Incredible!! Intuitive, simple, fluid, and has everything you need for organisation in one place ! Before downloading I had been using multiple apps to track my projects, habits, and events, and now i can do everything in one app it's amazing ! The pomo feature is also a great bonus :) An overall very enjoyable app, the widgets are soooooooo good, and the premium subscription is very reasonably priced and definitely worth it ! I recommend 100%.;1
"This is the best productivity app I've ever used! Easy to use and efficient! So happy to complete all the tasks in a systematic way and also by not forgetting them! I haven't upgraded to premium yet and still the app is at its best! I surely recommend everyone to try out this app and thank you ""Tick Tick"" for making so many things simpler! 😄✌🏻";1
This is the best app for mastering time managment!!!! I love this app so much because it tracks my habits and also its very very to use and its super aesthetic! You can also use the pomodoro method is you are studying! Trust me if your reading this download the app right now! Your not gonna regret it! THANKYOU TO THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THIS ITS BEEN HELPING ME ALOT💕💕💕;1
It's an AMAZING app. Ticks all features that I'm looking for. Love the device Syns, Reminders on sub-tasks, Habit and also the Focus feature. Also the widgets provided with the app are the best and is the key daily driver feature for me. Helps me a lot in getting organized! Thanks TickTick team. I'm really glad I upgraded to Premium to support you guys!! Would also be nice if the app supports a notes functionality where we can keep rich text content (with formatting) and also on regular tasks.;1
A clean and simple app that I've used for a long time now. It's really been helpful for scheduling various errands, tasks and events in my calendar. Its simplicity makes it really easy to use in daily life. Highly recommended.;1
Great app for what it is! I signed up for Premium asap to get access to more lists. Once you get the hang of it the UI is functional and easy to use and stays consistant across mobile/desktop platforms. Totally recommend;1
This app is strongly superior to Todoist! They fixed the problem of daily recurrent tasks that are marked as completed few minutes after midnight without making them skip a day, something that even Todoist Premium fails.. Only warning: the backup function doesn't backup attachments!!;1
The best app I've used so far, it has everything I need: checklists, recurring tasks, sticky reminders, desktop versions, Pomo timer and habit tracker. The paid version offers calendar view and task length timer, this could help you plan your hole day easily without worrying that you planned too much.;1
This is one of the best todo app on play store. It lets you manage your tasks and habits with a beautiful user interface. I have tried other task planner apps as well but all of them are too cluttered and most of the features are paid for them. This app provides habit tracking and analysis of the completed tasks as well.;1
Been using TickTick for three years now, and the mix of simplicity in use combined with the ability to track tasks and projects at a detail level, is perfect for me. The developer consistently updates the app with increased functionality and hones ease of use as well.;1
I tried out quite a few free scheduling apps that could be shared across members of a household/team, and this one was certainly best. One thing that I would like is if, when you make an event repeat, you could specify an end date for the repitition.;1
The best Todo list app I have come across!! I was able to move over my previous lists from wunderlist which made it so easy to set up and the ability to add subtasks and really easily move around and organise tasks is so helpful. The widgets are also really clean and customisable, no complaints!!;1
June2020 updated review....working great, does what I needed from it, great job (not sure why it went nuts last year but thought I'd give it another go....so glad I did) Nov2019 Used this app ages ago, loved it, got it back again last week but now I hate this app because it no longer works with my Samsung Gear Fit2 Pro. Deleting....for good...not happy;1
Simple and effective. Especially love using the widget.;1
I finally found the perfect to do list app for me, I stuck with Keep Notes because of how simple it is and got bored with it and decided to use TickTick thanks to MKBHD, I'm a college student and I'd like to one day pay for the premium version, for now the free version is more than enough for me.;1
This app is a great way to manage the tasks I have to complete for school. However, I wish there is a way to distinguish which task are from which list, like on the website.;1
Premium user. 17k tasks completed so far. Loved it until kanban update 2020-7-3. Kanban update hosed my db and made it so nothing could sync/refresh. Had to clear user data, cache, and reinstall. Not happy having to reset settings (theme, sounds, etc.) due to data/cache clear. Still love the app and use it many times a day.;1
This is most probably the best reminder app in android. I am using it for last couple of years after trying so many apps. I just love the widgets and the ad-less experience. I use it daily to manage my work. The reminder pop up is really helpful. Thank you developers.;1
This app deserves 5 stars mainly for its ability to back it up online and its categories. How I hope also I could add more categories other than being limited to two as I can't afford to avail the premium account.;1
I use the free version for a few years now. Very convenient to ise. No need to save anything. Every change you make is saved automatically. You can set priority for everything and categories tasks.;1
Great app. Def would appreciate more habit statistics in the future (similar to Loop), and the ability to drag and drop tasks into the calendar (loved this feature in Accomplish).;1
I have long been a big fan of Tick Tick, but the app just gets better. The latest addition of kanban card capability to mobile versions is fantastic. Please keep up the good work.;1
Pretty good for taking task and reminders. Gives a lot more things other apps don't give and you don't have to pay money in order to have basic app settings.;1
2020-07-03 update: ticktick seems to have added kanban view to mobile app and I am weirdly thrilled by this. This is the best cleanest Todo list app I've been able to find. Got my partner on and now we have a fully synchronized grocery shopping list. I live my life by my various lists on here and it's fantastic. Thanks team;1
Wow! I'm completely blown away by how amazing this app is. It does everything Wunderlist did and then some. What makes thus exceptional is the alerts. You get alerted alright. I also love the android widget so I can get *tasks at a glance*;1
Its actually very useful. Even without the premium mode and I reccomend it to anyone who has issues keeping track of everything. definitely the best planner I've used and miles ahead of Google Calender and other similar calendar tools. Definitely deserves a 5 star rating. .;1
I've been using ticktick for more than a month. I like that it's feature packed, has a macbook app, easy to sync, and has a calendar view. Lots of features that users can choose from.;1
I have ADHD, and struggle to manage my time and get things done. I've tried several apps but this one seems to be the best for me so far! I cant tell you why, but I have really taken to it and its helping me loads!;1
I have been using this for years, and it works really great nowadays. It has pretty much everything I need...and a lot more besides that! Thank you for this amazing app.;1
Unless you put ticktick widgets on home screen, the app won't be as effective to improve your productivity. Awesome app, now I am using my time in more productive activities and everything is in organised format. Happy to have such apps which can help for self growth.;1
"I very rarely leave reviews, but I have to say this is the best ""to do"" app I've ever used in my life. I've even tried all the popular ones and they didn't work for me like this one does. The notifications are amazing and I love that I can snooze them.";1
So far so good. For premium I would like more aesthetics like color backgrounds and icons, stickers, etc. But the functionality is pleasing so far. I'm a habitual shopper for the perfect organizer app. Can't say I won't keep looking for a prettier one;1
Exactly I wanted. I was using Google Keep for years but it was removing/lacking fundamental features. So moved to this and this is feature rich, much customizable.;1
Excellent! I've used this app for years. It helps me stay on track with all my projects. Love the addition of the Pomo timer. ❤️;1
I am a big list-maker, and this app really helps. I have it on desktop and my mobile. I list habits that I want to create or keep up with, on top of my work/project/chore lists. Would recommend for anyone with ADHD who needs to keep their day organised.;1
This app is amazing. I am using this for last 45 days and i am fully satisfied with ui and usability of this app. All the essential features are free unlike other app. Thank you tick tick team for creating this app.;1
Really head and shoulders above what I have tried before. Simple, intuitive and makes sense. Only occasional times not immediate sync from task you entered with date and your calendar widget and no manual refresh can be done. But this is minor and I still would give 5 stars.;1
Fabulous: just what I've been looking for. It keeps me on track and helps me manage multiple ongoing projects at once. Cheers.;1
The best to-do list app I have ever use. Go ahead. It has so many amazing features. Setting priority, lockscreen, description and many more.;1
It's the best to do list planner. Only thing I want from developer is to increase size of comments. Thank you for the efforts you put in making the app.;1
This app is really great! it's very easy to use and also has an option to save a copied piece of text (each line will be taken as a separate event) as several events - this was seriously a life saver!;1
I've tried a lot of to do apps... Like more to do apps than anyone should really try. This one is the best. It has everything I want EXCEPT the ability to change font.;1
Exceptional experience. I have been through to many app and this one final stuck as it cover multiple facet for productivity, time management, scheduling projects, and tasks management.;1
11/7/19: I've LITERALLY used it for five seconds and this is the best tasks app ever. jesus christ 6/10/20: Still a great app Insanely intuitive, if I say so myself, especially the snooze feature. Awesome.;1
I love the simple yet intuitive interface. It has a great system of sorting tasks by category, priority, and date. This app truly deserves 5 stars!;1
My favorite to-do checklist. The widget with adjustable opacity and size has a permanent home on my phone's home screen so I'm always on track. Syncs with the website too.;1
Better than todoist! I never thought I'll move away from todoist but it lacked some important features that TickTick has. Got the pro version. It's the only service I'm paying monthly for.;1
Probably the best productivity app available for FREE! The app itself is easy to use and it's really easy to make a task/routine. Highly recommended.;1
I tried many apps but this one is amazing. It is very easy to use and I will suggest that plz add copy paste option in it so that we can paste the same task easily.;1
During Corona my schedule is off I just seem to float and often forget the most routine things, now I am trying to get myself back into a routine, this will be a great tool for daily reminder.;1
Has been a phenomenal program! It has helped keeping my life on track and on schedule. I'm mega high while i write this. But it's a great tool!;1
This app has helped me boost my productivity. The reminders make sure, u don't miss out on anything and the UI is also pretty good. Over-all, a good app. Recommended;1
Just so good. Easy to use, lots of features, stable, can be used on desktop browsers as well the app - synced via account.;1
This app is changing my life and I recommend it to everyone who wants to start building discipline. Love the goal tracking and the tag system helps organize my lists into context/smart lists.;1
Excellent app. The first app in playstore that i got whuch reminded me of my tasks by alarm. Besides it also has to do list and pomodoro function in a single app! Loved it. Thanks TICKTICK team.;1
It's great! You can easily organize your time and finish all of your tasks for the day. I would reccomend it for anyone who has struggled with organising their time!;1
Excellent for to do lists, managing projects and tracking habits. I like the ability to have transparent widgets too.;1
Awesome! Loved that it performs a lot of things, a multi-functional tool. Plus it intergrates well with other tools, too.;1
Thanks for the app! It's great! It's completely cover all my needs. The design is simple and predictable. Special thanks for the ability to choose a color theme!;1
Easy to use, does what it says. Still love it, after several months of use. I have the free version. Love being able to make sublists.;1
"Easy to learn and use. Good for time management, sorting tasks, prioritizing. Much comfortable than other ""to do"" applications.";1
This is hands down the best Todo and calendar manager out there. Far better than Todoist or any of the others. Reminder alerts are great. I have all my bills, trash day, and important reminders all set up. Love this app!!;1
Wonderful!;1
Tick Tick is just hitting it out of the park for me. I originally starting using it because I loved the built in pomo, along with habit tracking. A few months back I got interested in using a kanban board but they did not integrate well with a to do list. Now I see that tick tick has added the option of viewing lists in a kanban style. It is AMAZING. Now it's a truly powerful app that can be a one stop shop for every productivity tool I actually use. I love it!!!;1
I've been using the app since 2018, TickTick has been the number 1 app for me, I definately reccomend it 👏👍💯;1
I feel good while exploring this app;1
Best productivity software ever!;1
"Funcional, útil, fácil de usar, se ha vuelto una de mis apps indispensables";1
good app what else should i say;1
Best to-do app on the market.;1
I have tried multiple kinds of planner apps and this is the best of them all. It is the only one I found that lets me make recurring to-dos, have everything in a calendar view and give each task a duration (paid features), track habits, have focus sessions, subtasks, reminders, get summaries about productivity, and sync with all my devices (MacBook, iPad, and android phone). The free version is good but I highly recommend the paid version. I am more motivated and productive because of this app.;1
Excellent app. My favorite. The best to-do list app in the recent years.;1
I love this app because it has everything I need.;1
It's very effective and executive.;1
One of the best of it's class;1
Awesome apk;1
The best freemium Task manager PERIOD.;1
Very useful;1
The best todo app out there !!;1
Simple and effective. Especially love using the widget.;1
Nice app.it is helps more for us.like to time set and remainders ....etc;1
A clean and simple app that I've used for a long time now. It's really been helpful for scheduling various errands, tasks and events in my calendar. Its simplicity makes it really easy to use in daily life. Highly recommended.;1
Goooodddd benerrrrrr, so helpfulllllll;1
excellent;1
Exceptional experience. I have been through to many app and this one final stuck as it cover multiple facet for productivity, time management, scheduling projects, and tasks management.;1
Very organized app;1
This app is a great way to manage the tasks I have to complete for school. However, I wish there is a way to distinguish which task are from which list, like on the website.;1
I installed every todo list app and I was unsatisfied. Most of them were not offering widget facility. But this app is all-in-one. You can collaborate with other apps as well, make to do lists, set alarms, make folders, set priorities, label your tasks and many more. This app is keeping me busy. Now, I love to do my tasks to update my list everyday.;1
great and easy to use app;1
Best App For all Habbit and reminders..east to use .. user friendly ..and loved the widget;1
Too lazy to write it down. I know, not helpful, but good app!;1
Great app. Def would appreciate more habit statistics in the future (similar to Loop), and the ability to drag and drop tasks into the calendar (loved this feature in Accomplish).;1
This is the overall best app that I have found for manging the things I need to do. I have downloaded 50 of the Google play stores highest rated to-do/task planner apps and nothing has come close to TickTick. The best quality of the app is the interface. 6 months ago i paid for one year subscription of the to do planner app 'any.do' and was using that until I found TickTick. I left an app i paid for to use this - which is free but can be upgraded to premium, which I plan to do.;1
excellent app. nice and flexible UI;1
Excellent for to do lists, managing projects and tracking habits. I like the ability to have transparent widgets too.;1
best productive app in playstore;1
A good simple and not user friendly app.;1
Best app to reorganize life;1
This app is strongly superior to Todoist! They fixed the problem of daily recurrent tasks that are marked as completed few minutes after midnight without making them skip a day, something that even Todoist Premium fails.. Only warning: the backup function doesn't backup attachments!!;1
Very good app;1
The integration with Google assistant works very well;1
Exactly I wanted. I was using Google Keep for years but it was removing/lacking fundamental features. So moved to this and this is feature rich, much customizable.;1
New version causing freezes and crashes. :-(;1
Very helpful in organizing things, highly recommended;1
Awesome reminder;1
Wood I luv this app cuz now I am well organised n I plan all my project work in. As a student I would advise others 2 download it 2 make ur life more well organized . Thanks a lot ticktick;1
Highly recommend simple useful application;1
I've tried a lot of to do apps... Like more to do apps than anyone should really try. This one is the best. It has everything I want EXCEPT the ability to change font.;1
Good experience;1
I installed it after watching MKBHD using it in his every daily driver and it had all the feature I needed.;1
It's a pretty good app and most important aspect it has is the ability to keep track of a habit. It's pretty simple how it is done. Also you can look back at the apps's calendar and see the days that you did follow that habit.;1
It's good! For to do list;1
It has helped to enhance my personal development routine and a real personal assistant. Thanks;1
Love having different lists to keep work and home separate.;1
Best app;1
I have been using this for years, and it works really great nowadays. It has pretty much everything I need...and a lot more besides that! Thank you for this amazing app.;1
Pretty good for taking task and reminders. Gives a lot more things other apps don't give and you don't have to pay money in order to have basic app settings.;1
It's great my cousin offered it to me and now I said it can help you surely 😊;1
This app is very helpful for me, because I use a system called GTD, and I can use that system in this app, I'm very grateful;1
Another perfect mobile application ! Should send competitors teams to UI/UX design board. Excellent/perfect (hard) work !;1
Been using for a little over a week and I really enjoy this experience. Traditional to-do list functionality combined with a habit tracker and pomodoro timer really hits all the marks I need from a productivity app. My only complaints are the lack of certain functionality for the Mac app, but on Android you're knocking it out of the park.;1
Great app 👌👍;1
I regret not being able to offer more than five stars. After trying every app there is my search is over now. It has everything kanban, lists, subtasks, habit tracking, pomorodo and reminders (though reminders are not working in android, but on pc it is great). I hope you guys will provide a sneak peak into calendar feature for free users too. Only thing missing is gnatt chart feature.;1
Convenient, simplistic and intuitive.;1
Great app for what it is! I signed up for Premium asap to get access to more lists. Once you get the hang of it the UI is functional and easy to use and stays consistant across mobile/desktop platforms. Totally recommend;1
Love it!;1
Very useful to do list program;1
Great App...;1
Bestest app ever I love this app it helped me a lot to remember things I have to do;1
Best Todo list app I've ever used. Well worth the cost;1
Very neat interface;1
This app helps me a lot in getting my things done;1
It keeps me organized!;1
Amazing app. This really really helps me to increase my productivity, and to keep a note of the things which I need to do. And thank you so much for the cross platform support, I can access my tasks over my pc or anywhere I want. This app solved several problems of mine;1
Best app for this need;1
Easy to use and no more forget events with friends and customers anymore.;1
Great;1
Really great tool to boost up your productivity!!;1
Very useful app which perfectly suits my needs. I can set today's todos and track the habits. The functions are also very convenient.;1
Just so good. Easy to use, lots of features, stable, can be used on desktop browsers as well the app - synced via account.;1
This is so far the best productivity app I've used. It has everything I need - to-do list, kanban, calendar, pomodoro, habit tracker. I used to use a few apps to have all these features, but now I just use this app. Would be nice though if I can tag and group habits, too. Also, is the habits feature accessible in the desktop version? I haven't figured it out.;1
Amazing app;1
Very good application for life managing;1
This app is improving my life, seriously.;1
During Corona my schedule is off I just seem to float and often forget the most routine things, now I am trying to get myself back into a routine, this will be a great tool for daily reminder.;1
This is the best app for planning;1
Best to do list app available;1
Nice just make a shortcut to view in the homepage like a widget.that would be nice;1
Best app for manage time;1
The thing I have been searching for years... Finally found multiple things in a single app;1
Great;1
This is a really helpful app ♥️;1
Good but notifications are not working;1
Useful but need some improvement!!!;1
Greattt app!!;1
Soo good app;1
I am well please with this app. If you are interested in quality productivity app with simplicity, then it is Tick Tick.;1
I love it except, and this is a big issue for me, it's totally server based. Want to update anything, but have a bad internet connection? Too bad, it's either going to take forever or fail. I would use and maybe even pay for this app to just have a way to have everything first be saved on my device. So, back to hunting for a to-do app. Edit 3/23: I have to drop my review on this to 1 star. You can manually edit values within the app for stats making any it unreasonable that I need internet.;0
Buggy as all hell. The advertisement is right. It gamifies tasks... But that's it. No tracking history of your habits. Inaccurate as all hell. Worst of all is you can't delete your account. They'll forever keep your data. I'm sure that's illegal in parts of this country and around the world. Definitely don't use your real email to sign up to test it out.;0
Broken app on Android. Tried to create a new account and objects were missing from the app. For instance, the initial tutorial only had pictures and no words. Also when making my avatar, there were no images or options that showed up. Worked fine on my wife's iPhone but not my note 9.;0
I should be able to use the app when offline, and the app should sync the changes whenever connected to the internet. It shouldn't force me to connect with the internet for ticking a checkbox!;0
Loads of bugs, can't even register. Probably due to server side reliance and poor state management in the app. Will definitely avoid.;0
It's been months and I still cannot delete this one habit. It will not delete and nothing I've been sent has been helpful to figure out why. About ready to find a different app cause it's driving me nuts.;0
Opaque, complicated, janky. Overall, a frustrating and confusing ap.;0
"What is going on? The app says ""server connection lost""";0
I cant Register on this app. It always says 'server connection lost '.;0
Y doesn't the reminder work!!! I m trying m trying changed all my settings according to this and it doesn't work at all it doesn't remind me i tried and set a particular time and i was waiting but it didn't i m fed up really this made me more anger than ever🤧🥵😶😶😶😶😑😑😑;0
It does not seem possible to have a simple shopping list shared with another person... Nice app, but useless.;0
"Have to register and the app doesn't even work. Nothing happens when you press ""let's start"".";0
"Can't even start it properly. Just says ""Path 'profile.name' is required.""";0
Unfortunately i can not sign up or sign in. By google account or email. I tried a lot. From iran;0
This app is completely unusable on my Note10+ The account creation is riddled with errors and when I finally get into the app, I can't click on any items or add a new item without the app instantly crashing. I was excited by the premise and motivated to start using it, but the experience was downright embarrassing. I'd love for a developer response here to acknowledge these problems and maybe offer some solutions.;0
Great concept, but I can't even create an avatar. This is a constant bug listed in reviews. The company says that your selections should show up after you start actually using the app, but how can they when we can't even actually CHOOSE anything. I guess I'll try one of the competitors apps.;0
DL'd to try this app out, but could not get past the initial setup. Buttons missing labels or information, lethargic loading issues, and the graphics are really sub par for what other games host currently. Even the initial avatar appearance has most things locked behind a pay wall, and keeps putting me in a wheelchair! The idea behind the app has a lot of potential, and would be a joy to see if they can make it better and working properly. Will have to wait and see. As is? Not functional.;0
I really want to use this app, but on my Galaxy S10, the first 2 of the 3 slides in the introduction before logging in, are blank. The character visuals on the character customization are invisible, and on the settings menu, I scroll down and the options start to overlap each other (hard to describe). I will consider reinstalling after the graphical issues are fixed because it seems like a great app, but currently it's unusable for me.;0
Would love to actually get started with this app, but for whatever reason I can't even build my avatar. None of the options for selecting what I want my avatar to look like actually show up on the screen, they're all completely invisible.;0
This seems like a fun idea, and was recommended to me as especially helpful for people with ADHD, so I was intrigued. Unfortunately, I have encountered a bug where when I get to the screen where I choose my screen name and username, I cannot press the next button after filling out the name and username. Then, when I exit the app and go back to it, it's the default character and I cannot customise it/my account.;0
This app has some major problems. It seemed to work fine for the first day of running. After the first day no reminders were executed. Any game armor or weapons could never be equipped. it appeared you could equip them but once you left the screen they become unequipped and they never showed up on the avatar. I mainly got this app for productivity and since the reminders do not work I'm not certain I'm going to continue using it unless these problems are fixed.;0
"I really wanted to love this app. It looks amazing & has so much potential. However, the app does not sync to your timezone. My day does not reset at midnight, despite what the app says. When I try to change the reset time to match up with the incorrect timezone, it keeps switching back to midnight. So my day randomly resets, usually around 6 or 7 pm. Sometimes, the day doesn't reset for more than 24 hours. & my avatar takes damage for the ""missed"" day. Makes it impossible to effectively use. :(";0
Pretty disappointed that the first wall I hit is having to login or register. I get the whole cloud saving thing but at least give me the option and let the risk fall on me for data loss. The app looked promising and I was really impressed with the bit of pixel art I got to see. However, I'm not sure I want to sign up and allow access to my details or habits just yet.;0
As soon as I downloaded the app and made a new account, I couldn't create a new character because under the body, skin, and other options to make your character was blank. When I changed my display name, I got a weird message for 'profile.name' required. The randomize button didn't even work for me either. I left originally because there were many bugs with to-do's and other things and I'm not confident it's functional past the character creator, so I don't see a point to continue. On the S10E;0
Need to be online to use this app. In case you make changes in offline mode. It doesn't sync automatically when online. You need to again make those changes. Enable offline feature and offline data should be synced when ever we are online. Once this is done, you got my 5 star.;0
"Busted from the start. On the first open of the app I got a 3 pane swipe intro and the first 2 were blank purple screens. Then, on the Avatar creation screen the Avatar wasn't visible. When finally getting in to the app the ""help text"" bubble didn't point at anything, just the bottom of the screen for the whole dialogue. This app sounded interesting but it seems there's a complete lack of interest in quality.";0
Requires being online to use. Which is a shame because it looks like a fun way to get motivated. Would use if it didn't require constant network or wifi connection (I live and work in rural areas) . Had to uninstall due to inability to use throughout the day.;0
First thing I did when I installed the app was disable notifications and yet I still get constantly spammed with notifications all day long. That aside, the app is poorly made. UI is very buggy. Chat functions are glitchy and don't update mezsages correctly. Sometimes the main ui responds to nothing. You can switch tabs and nothing changes till you close and open the app again. Almost all fun and worth while content is locked behind a paywall or subscription.;0
Downloaded this app hoping for a fun way to form new habits, but when I get to the register screen the first two tutorial panels are blank and then the third one lets you link social media accounts. Then I can't save the username and display name I create, and the avatar generator screen doesn't load any options. Opened the app the next day to find nothing I could edit had been saved. Uninstalled and tried registering again with a different account and got the same results. Pretty disappointed;0
There seems to be no way to actually mark a task as complete, so I had to delete the tasks I actually did complete and therefore have not gotten in-game rewards. There is also no way at all to contact support. If you join the Habitat Help Guild that is supposed to allow you to ask questions, there is no obvious way to post a question there. There is a button to leave the guild but not one to post a question. This app is terrible and is a waste of time.;0
The app is broken right now. Downloaded today to try it out and the first two slides were blank. Character creation is all blank. Unfortunately deleted but was looking forward to trying. This has been catalogued by others. When its fixed I'll try again but so far it seems that this app is only really properly supported for iPhone users. (I have a Samsung S9);0
I have just downloaded this app and I can't register. Is there a reason for that?;0
I had really begun to depend on this app and was having fun. Then I downloaded the update. I now have NOTHING. Not even the IMAGE of an avatar, there's just NOTHING THERE. I have no experience, no level, no coins, NOTHING. I was having a really awful day and this was just icing on the cake. There was so much I put into this game. How can I remember all of the tasks I scheduled for myself? I am so so discouraged.;0
I downloaded this app because I thought that the game concept for to-do lists would be really cool. Opened the app just after downloading and tried to register an account and it wouldn't let me log in. Waited another hour and it still wasn't working. Call me impatient but I just couldn't use an app that refused to work.;0
Ever get a phone call from a Salesman whom you don't remember giving your phone number out to? this is the app that does it. it reads your phone number and identity and uploads it to the cloud where it can later be sold to the highest bidder. this app makes sure that it gets your identity because you have to login before you can even use it. once you log in, the game is a huge disappointment. mypoli has everything over this.;0
Same issue as Don Smith who wrote a review on 10/10/19. Will consider this app but the lack of slide visuals and character visuals makes the app in-op. Current phone is the Google pixel 4xl......perhaps I misspoke in regards to the reply. My issue is not with the visuals but the lack of visuals. Everything is blank for me so literally can not see half of the content.;0
Just starting and learning how to use. Unable to set correct due date on tasks. When I select that task has a due date, todays date appears. When I click that date the calendar displays. Allgood so far. But when I select a date on the calendar and close it, the due date is still today.;0
You need internet access and the server has to be up on their side for you to be able to access your to-do list. Server has been down today and I cant check off or edit my to-do list due to that. Going to be deleting this app. Most other to-do lists work offline.;0
I have been wanting to try out this app for a while. I registered, and everything is going great until i get to the character maker screen. i am unable to see my charcter and the customization options. Will send photos if needed. Will change rating once this is fixed.;0
Doesn't seem to work on OP 6T, can go through character creation, but doesnt let me customize or select anything. half of the UI shows up blank.;0
Can't even log in. Seems to stop working or freeze up every time. Just downloaded the app for the first time, can't make a new account or log in. Waste of time, will be looking for other apps that actually let me get past the log in screen.;0
"App broken, don't bother. Like many many other reviewers, this app is totally broken and defunct on Android devices and specifically Galaxy S10 / Note 10 devices. It seems the developer response to all of those reviews is ""please report a bug"" but this has now been an issue for months that they haven't looked into fixing despite dozens of notifications from users that their app is broken. I have instead now downloaded an app by another developer which actually works. I will not be back.";0
I kept getting empty screens when opening the app, so I pressed skip. Filled out the registry info and was taken to character creation where I couldn't see my character or the build options. I could select things like body or hair, but nothing appeared relating to that.;0
I love it at first plus the very idea gamifying a task to make it a habit. It was all fun until the 'I cant use it offline' that really threw me off. Please make it available offline as well.;0
My phone is a Samsung S8+. The introduction screen is mostly blank, and the character customization seems to be broken because your character and customization options don't show up. I didnt go any further.;0
Quite disappointed with this app. Is used to be fine for past years. Currently is really slow when checking my task and is so frustrating at times. This app need improvement on the server and at times server down :(.;0
I cancelled my subscription back in June of last year and just realized my membership had been reinstated without my permission. I would like a refund for the months between now and then and (another) confirmation that my subscription is cancelled.;0
Wanted to try this, but it doesn't seem to properly load images to create my character or load tutorial pages so I can't even continue from the create screen. Seems like it's broken...;0
"The first 2 slides are black and I can't see character in the character creation. Some message saying ""path 'profile' required habitica...i hope this gets fix soon. Until then I I'll wait.";0
Please make it work again. The app is great, but it is not working and says I'm not connected to the internet, even though I have 2 available connections. Please, fix it!!!;0
The two starting pages were blank, same as character customization. I saw another comment and there's any new version to update. I was excited to try this app but I couldn't :(;0
I couldnt even get past setting everything up before it glitched. I couldnt move on from types of goals. A pop up showed up that said something about strength and attributes.;0
I was looking forward to using this app. But it wont even let me pick out an avatar. Things just go blank on the app and tells me I'm missing information when I clearly am not. What a bummer;0
Online? really? register? really? There's two other apps in the suggested/similar apps banner that are better than this & they're free to use with out registration (why?! for this type of app) , full & offline ( again);0
nothing but connection error after connection error. the concept is great, but I can't even manage to use the service because any time I try to do anything, that's all I'm getting.;0
It took 3 tries to get registered, now it wont let me change anything in character creation. I didnt even make it to setting up anything beyond skin tone before it wouldn't let me select anything. Awesome idea, crappy execution. Womp womp.;0
Completely unusable on Android right now. Everything is blank or not loading. Downloaded and deleted right away which is unfortunate because it looked like something I'd be really interested in.;0
App is completely broken. Can't even make an avatar -- none of the options show up. Also, get an error message when trying to show a display name;0
So many portions of the app we're not appearing on the screen from the get go, including the first two screens entirely, and even the avartar selections.;0
Seems broken - cant complete the process of creating new tasks, so I'm just stuck with a huge empty menu I cant change. Loved the idea but this is broken and unusable.;0
Want to like it. So far half of the set up items aren't even showing up for my samsung s8. All the purple screens are blank. Was excited to try but it doesn't work.;0
Just installed. Keyed in all tasks n to-do list. Server error. Lost everything. Redo. Server error. Lost. Kept repeating. Frustrating = Uninstalled.;0
I keep getting a message saying the app can't connect to the server and every time I tap on a different colour of skin or shirt it stays the same.;0
This app is bullocks.I downloaded it and it ran smoothly on my phone and i setup my avatar my habits and my daily task and then it just stopped working and couldn't open the app again!;0
Update: problem fixed. Did you people just do another update? Because the app is completely screwed up. It can't recognize that my phone is connected to the internet.;0
The customization screen at the beginning of set-up doesn't work. Tasks have tagging section with no clear way to actually add tags to it.;0
I was excited to try this app, but like many others have said, the customization screen doesn't work. Let me know when it's fixed and I'll update and hopefully be able to start using it.;0
It's completely broken, things don't show up, error codes from the very beginning, it's just broken;0
"i cannt acces my account anymore since their ""password reset"" feature does not work. tried on my iphone, android oreo, web version. i don't receive any email to reset my password.";0
It's broken. I try to create my account and I can't even use the name I want or customize my character. It's just broken. Nothing displays.;0
App is no longer functional. Cant even Start app without it malfunctioning. Cant change username or character. It was fine before the update!;0
I AM SPECIFICALLY LOOKING FOR A GAMIFIED PRODUCTIVITY APP. MY REVIEW OF YOURS WHICH IS VERY LACKING: Dark theme is missing! This one appears to be for 5 year olds! Can you make a NON-CHILD app similar to this but for REGULAR PEOPLE not 5 year old RPG gamers? I avoided yours for a long time but still nothing exists yet for adults. I hate RPG (cause I'm not an anti-social loser) but want to gamify my productivity with public leaderboards in an app. Thanks. Looks well made but I don't want it.;0
Can't log in. The password input is shorter on the in-app login than both the reset password field as well as the login form on web, so my correct password is rejected;0
App has many bugs. 1. Start screen doesn't display first 3 slides. User creating is totally not functional. I'm using both Android 9 and Android 10 same bugs.;0
I can use Habitica on the browser, but I can't login via Facebook in the app. The Facebook login shows up, I enter my credentials, then nothing.;0
I CANNOT CHANGE the order of dailies which is frustrating since normally I would like to have them in chronological order.;0
App worked fine till they put in the new username update, now there's a bug where you can't get into the app because every name is taken;0
Won't connect to server. Will rate better when this issue is fixed. I'm using a Samsung Galaxy Note 8;0
beginning setup wasn't loading at all. signed up using Facebook. since it was not loading, i just clicked next. now I'm stuck with my Avatar with no way to change;0
after signing in, I get random notifications telling me things I absolutely do not care about. I haven't even added any tasks and it's already telling me to join groups and blah blah blah... no thank you.;0
Blank screens when initially launching, character creation screen missing most assets but still semi functional. Unable to begin. Oneplus 6T A10;0
Great app but only if it was an offline app i would've given it a five star... please fix this...;0
Awful graphics. Idea ia great but the graphics need a major update. Can't tell the different between anything in this game. Overall disappointed.;0
Definitely not for me, it was confusing. But hey if you are a gamer and suffering from mental health stuff. its for you;0
"Doesn't work. Nothing happens when signing in with Google and when creating a new account, it just shows ""server timeout"".";0
Uninstalled. Still cannot remove background to blank. Edit: Yep still the same. Also please put the free backgrounds at the top. This is from only within the app by the way.;0
It doesn't work. Worked fine first few hours now it keeps saying it can't connect to the server;0
App didn't work at all. Was buggy from the start of my sign up where I used my Google account to login.;0
Stuck on setting the user name, no error message etc. Used to be good;0
Uninstalling, took forever to load when my internet connection is just working fine on other apps.;0
Downloaded the app and the server just did not want to connect and synch my to do list and habits. Gave up after 10 mins.;0
confusing and definitely didn't motivate me to do tasks. just spent hours trying to figure out how to add personalized tasks.;0
Failed at the first hurdle, couldnt customise my character to even get started. Next button worked thats about it. galaxy S8;0
Installed it and it glitched and didn't display many of the images on the 'create your avatar' page. Immediately Uninstalled.;0
Unable to download it beyond 78% even as other apps download in a second;0
Constant connection drop outs. Will update review when this is fixed.;0
the big problem is that task management should work offline and habitica should have synchronization feature like anki mobile and anki pc.;0
Super buggy on Android, have to close and open constantly for anything to work.;0
Doesn't work in my country I have to use a VPN for it to work, which sucks of course. Syrian Arab Republic;0
Nothing has changed, this dumb app still won't sync up with my account I use on my desk top. Come on, developers! And it still forces me to open a new account. This is why I won't subscribe, the help here is useless.;0
Crashes;0
I cant Register on this app. It always says 'server connection lost '.;0
"What is going on? The app says ""server connection lost""";0
Opaque, complicated, janky. Overall, a frustrating and confusing ap.;0
It's been months and I still cannot delete this one habit. It will not delete and nothing I've been sent has been helpful to figure out why. About ready to find a different app cause it's driving me nuts.;0
can somebody tell me why the heck wud this app wanna hv accesss to my gmail account???;0
I have just downloaded this app and I can't register. Is there a reason for that?;0
Loads of bugs, can't even register. Probably due to server side reliance and poor state management in the app. Will definitely avoid.;0
I can't download it to my phone;0
Y doesn't the reminder work!!! I m trying m trying changed all my settings according to this and it doesn't work at all it doesn't remind me i tried and set a particular time and i was waiting but it didn't i m fed up really this made me more anger than ever🤧🥵😶😶😶😶😑😑😑;0
Broken app on Android. Tried to create a new account and objects were missing from the app. For instance, the initial tutorial only had pictures and no words. Also when making my avatar, there were no images or options that showed up. Worked fine on my wife's iPhone but not my note 9.;0
the app's interfere is really irritating it's already sets meaningless things for you in infine order;0
"Have to register and the app doesn't even work. Nothing happens when you press ""let's start"".";0
Can no longer add tasks to challenges. Data won't save. Rubbish app.;0
Stuck on setting the user name, no error message etc. Used to be good;0
Unable to download it beyond 78% even as other apps download in a second;0
Waste of time. Unhelpful and unmotivating.;0
Kept bugging out trying to register/log in;0
Too many errors;0
I love it except, and this is a big issue for me, it's totally server based. Want to update anything, but have a bad internet connection? Too bad, it's either going to take forever or fail. I would use and maybe even pay for this app to just have a way to have everything first be saved on my device. So, back to hunting for a to-do app. Edit 3/23: I have to drop my review on this to 1 star. You can manually edit values within the app for stats making any it unreasonable that I need internet.;0
It does not seem possible to have a simple shopping list shared with another person... Nice app, but useless.;0
I should be able to use the app when offline, and the app should sync the changes whenever connected to the internet. It shouldn't force me to connect with the internet for ticking a checkbox!;0
Buggy as all hell. The advertisement is right. It gamifies tasks... But that's it. No tracking history of your habits. Inaccurate as all hell. Worst of all is you can't delete your account. They'll forever keep your data. I'm sure that's illegal in parts of this country and around the world. Definitely don't use your real email to sign up to test it out.;0
Stopped;0
"Can't even start it properly. Just says ""Path 'profile.name' is required.""";0
Unfortunately i can not sign up or sign in. By google account or email. I tried a lot. From iran;0
Great concept, but I can't even create an avatar. This is a constant bug listed in reviews. The company says that your selections should show up after you start actually using the app, but how can they when we can't even actually CHOOSE anything. I guess I'll try one of the competitors apps.;0
This app is completely unusable on my Note10+ The account creation is riddled with errors and when I finally get into the app, I can't click on any items or add a new item without the app instantly crashing. I was excited by the premise and motivated to start using it, but the experience was downright embarrassing. I'd love for a developer response here to acknowledge these problems and maybe offer some solutions.;0
Mandatory registration;0
impossible to register, circle, circle, circle... and nothing;0
Broken from the start, can't do anything;0
Doesn't seem to work on OP 6T, can go through character creation, but doesnt let me customize or select anything. half of the UI shows up blank.;0
Cant see my character;0
App has no images on S10+ and is completely unusuable;0
Would love to actually get started with this app, but for whatever reason I can't even build my avatar. None of the options for selecting what I want my avatar to look like actually show up on the screen, they're all completely invisible.;0
I was looking forward to using this app. But it wont even let me pick out an avatar. Things just go blank on the app and tells me I'm missing information when I clearly am not. What a bummer;0
App has many bugs. 1. Start screen doesn't display first 3 slides. User creating is totally not functional. I'm using both Android 9 and Android 10 same bugs.;0

Completely unusable on Android right now. Everything is blank or not loading. Downloaded and deleted right away which is unfortunate because it looked like something I'd be really interested in.;0
The app is broken right now. Downloaded today to try it out and the first two slides were blank. Character creation is all blank. Unfortunately deleted but was looking forward to trying. This has been catalogued by others. When its fixed I'll try again but so far it seems that this app is only really properly supported for iPhone users. (I have a Samsung S9);0
After adding task to the app, it just doesn't shows up.;0

Doesnt work the main screen is stuck i can move to the next page.;0
Downloaded this app hoping for a fun way to form new habits, but when I get to the register screen the first two tutorial panels are blank and then the third one lets you link social media accounts. Then I can't save the username and display name I create, and the avatar generator screen doesn't load any options. Opened the app the next day to find nothing I could edit had been saved. Uninstalled and tried registering again with a different account and got the same results. Pretty disappointed;0
Same issue as Don Smith who wrote a review on 10/10/19. Will consider this app but the lack of slide visuals and character visuals makes the app in-op. Current phone is the Google pixel 4xl......perhaps I misspoke in regards to the reply. My issue is not with the visuals but the lack of visuals. Everything is blank for me so literally can not see half of the content.;0
Doesn't show character customisation, think it needs an update;0
Path profile name is required glitch when trying to make avatar on Galaxy s10;0
So many portions of the app we're not appearing on the screen from the get go, including the first two screens entirely, and even the avartar selections.;0
"Busted from the start. On the first open of the app I got a 3 pane swipe intro and the first 2 were blank purple screens. Then, on the Avatar creation screen the Avatar wasn't visible. When finally getting in to the app the ""help text"" bubble didn't point at anything, just the bottom of the screen for the whole dialogue. This app sounded interesting but it seems there's a complete lack of interest in quality.";0

The website works but the app is blank.;0
This app has some major problems. It seemed to work fine for the first day of running. After the first day no reminders were executed. Any game armor or weapons could never be equipped. it appeared you could equip them but once you left the screen they become unequipped and they never showed up on the avatar. I mainly got this app for productivity and since the reminders do not work I'm not certain I'm going to continue using it unless these problems are fixed.;0
It's broken. I try to create my account and I can't even use the name I want or customize my character. It's just broken. Nothing displays.;0
I have been trying to download the app but its just not happening. Please look into it.;0
App is completely broken. Can't even make an avatar -- none of the options show up. Also, get an error message when trying to show a display name;0
Please make this app offline as well;0
Wanted to try this, but it doesn't seem to properly load images to create my character or load tutorial pages so I can't even continue from the create screen. Seems like it's broken...;0
Will not open disappointed as i was looking forward to using this service;0
Can't log in. The password input is shorter on the in-app login than both the reset password field as well as the login form on web, so my correct password is rejected;0
It keeps lagging and dificult to select the traits i want for my character... ugh ! Not worth it UNINSTALL !;0
Can't set the username field;0
App is no longer functional. Cant even Start app without it malfunctioning. Cant change username or character. It was fine before the update!;0

You need internet access and the server has to be up on their side for you to be able to access your to-do list. Server has been down today and I cant check off or edit my to-do list due to that. Going to be deleting this app. Most other to-do lists work offline.;0
I had really begun to depend on this app and was having fun. Then I downloaded the update. I now have NOTHING. Not even the IMAGE of an avatar, there's just NOTHING THERE. I have no experience, no level, no coins, NOTHING. I was having a really awful day and this was just icing on the cake. There was so much I put into this game. How can I remember all of the tasks I scheduled for myself? I am so so discouraged.;0
I couldn't register , the circle rounds and rounds .. And nothing happens;0
Can't even log in. Seems to stop working or freeze up every time. Just downloaded the app for the first time, can't make a new account or log in. Waste of time, will be looking for other apps that actually let me get past the log in screen.;0
It's completely broken, things don't show up, error codes from the very beginning, it's just broken;0
As soon as I downloaded the app and made a new account, I couldn't create a new character because under the body, skin, and other options to make your character was blank. When I changed my display name, I got a weird message for 'profile.name' required. The randomize button didn't even work for me either. I left originally because there were many bugs with to-do's and other things and I'm not confident it's functional past the character creator, so I don't see a point to continue. On the S10E;0
I kept getting empty screens when opening the app, so I pressed skip. Filled out the registry info and was taken to character creation where I couldn't see my character or the build options. I could select things like body or hair, but nothing appeared relating to that.;0
I really want to use this app, but on my Galaxy S10, the first 2 of the 3 slides in the introduction before logging in, are blank. The character visuals on the character customization are invisible, and on the settings menu, I scroll down and the options start to overlap each other (hard to describe). I will consider reinstalling after the graphical issues are fixed because it seems like a great app, but currently it's unusable for me.;0
Major issues need all email so I can send you pics pixel 2xl;0
Apps been broken from the moment I download need fixing;0
Nothing loads up. Probably a bad glitch;0
beginning setup wasn't loading at all. signed up using Facebook. since it was not loading, i just clicked next. now I'm stuck with my Avatar with no way to change;0
There seems to be no way to actually mark a task as complete, so I had to delete the tasks I actually did complete and therefore have not gotten in-game rewards. There is also no way at all to contact support. If you join the Habitat Help Guild that is supposed to allow you to ask questions, there is no obvious way to post a question there. There is a button to leave the guild but not one to post a question. This app is terrible and is a waste of time.;0
after signing in, I get random notifications telling me things I absolutely do not care about. I haven't even added any tasks and it's already telling me to join groups and blah blah blah... no thank you.;0
Micro transaction. I wish I could give 0 stars.;0
Need to register, immediately deleted;0
I am unable to download this app. It downloads uptil 82% and then stops. I have a android device;0
Awful graphics. Idea ia great but the graphics need a major update. Can't tell the different between anything in this game. Overall disappointed.;0

Good app but i can't do anything since To days ago ! Help me please your app je very usefull for me;0
Annoying, slow, clunky, unresponsive, repetitive;0
I was excited to try this app, but like many others have said, the customization screen doesn't work. Let me know when it's fixed and I'll update and hopefully be able to start using it.;0
It took 3 tries to get registered, now it wont let me change anything in character creation. I didnt even make it to setting up anything beyond skin tone before it wouldn't let me select anything. Awesome idea, crappy execution. Womp womp.;0
Failed at the first hurdle, couldnt customise my character to even get started. Next button worked thats about it. galaxy S8;0
Wouldn't even let me customize.;0
The customization screen at the beginning of set-up doesn't work. Tasks have tagging section with no clear way to actually add tags to it.;0
Idk what happened, but from the start app was just alright, and it was very nice and I was happy that i found it. But since a few hours it just stopped working! When I'm trying to complete the task it just doesn't count. The mark is appears, but several seconds later it vanishes!!! And also when I'm trying to complete a part of assignment it doesn't count. Please fix :(;0
I tried buying gems but it doesn't look like I got the gems.... But my balance in the Google pay thing has gone down. Last time I throw away money on this app. Update: the gems showed up the following day. Not sure if that's because I emailed them about it or just it took several hours to go through.;0
The app is so good but it's completely destroyed by the fact that it's online for most things as far as i know you need internet and the point is that you can use this even when it's offline i hope they fix it after that it deserves all 5 stars;0
"Not for couples or friends. Subscription for ""teams"" to share tasks. Doesn't think money from their micro transactions shop is enough.";0
Was really really excited for this, but then it's glitchy (I ended up with tons of duplicates of the habits which takes forever to delete cause you can only delete individually) and it relies on internet, so I can't use it for when I'm out. Oh well :((;0
The app itself is useful but they charged me three times for one subscription and will not respond to me when I email them.;0
Excited to try it out, but the app crashes whenever I try to create or edit tasks!;0
No good as other applications but good for games and one task or goal like da daily routines work;0
It takes too long to be fun, and sets you up for failure. At the start you are asked to create a small # of tasks. However, the number of tasks you do is directly related to how fast you level. And a few tasks means it takes a LONG time to get to level 10 which is when you finally get to pick a class. However, you could level faster if you add more tasks, but doing that before you are ready will set you up to fail. This is not discouraged as it should be, and there few goals at lower levels.;0
"Despite various updates to ""fix bugs"" the first few screens of this app are still completely broken on Android. The app beyond sign-in still functions...but that's it. The game aspect is weak, the app isn't very well designed, and the tutorials tend to be broken on Android as well. I prefer apps like Fabulous, which I think approaches the subject of mental health and habit forming in a much better way.";0
fun and helpful. graphics are awesome. just needs a few tweaks. too easy to cheat. i don't like the tavern because i am in recovery from drugs and alcohol so it's kinda anthemic. maybe a temple option would be a better social forum for inclusion for those of us who don't drink and/or use drugs. it would also be nice if you could continue to see completed to-do items after you have checked them so you can continue to visualize your progress.;0
This app would be so much better if it didn't penalize you for doing your habits for many days in a row. Instead of getting more experience, coins, you get less the longer you do something. You should be rewarding the habits that people are building, not telling them that once they have the Habit they're going to get less for it. Otherwise, this app would get five stars for me.;0
"I love the idea of this app. Unfortunately, it is not super user friendly. I've been using it for over a month and it is not very obvious how to complete quests or anything else. (and yes, I have gone through the FAQs) I finally figured out how to hatch eggs, but that's all. It's a pretty clunky app as a ""game"" but it does a pretty good job of keeping me accountable for things. That's the only reason I haven't deleted it. As a ""Gamify your life"" app, I'm not convinced. Hopefully it improves!";0
Great concept, but riddled with bugs. Sign up was horribly difficult, with the servers not responding and the app failing to realize I was trying to change my username and display names. App reset at around 7:00 pm, instead of at midnight of my time zone, which I had double checked beforehand. I want to like it, but this is becoming downright frustrating.;0
I honestly didn't get much chance to use the app before it stopped connecting and not letting me do anything. Before that happened i started setting up daily tasks and the part where you set how often (such as the days of the week) you do each task was confusing. I would change the days on one task and it would change it for all of them. Over all, too much work for its worth. Loved the idea though, it would have really gotten me doing things to level up and collect items;0
Needs a VPN if you're in China. Some questionable UI and design choices, though the fundamentals work well for the most part. If you want to do anything remotely interesting then you have to pay, of course. And the subscription fees are absolutely extortionate. One month is the same price as a month of Netflix and a year is £47. A year of MS Office 365 with all of its functionality is £60... Let that sink in. I don't understand why, for relatively little, this app costs so much. Greed, I assume.;0
"I wanted to use this app. The concept is really good. But I won't use it simply because it barely functions. For starters it's online only... but as if that wasn't enough the sync on Android is just all over the place - the app would sometimes ask ""have you done these things today?"" for tasks that were scheduled the day before or at 1 AM for tasks on that day... Speaking of tasks, I couldn't set up multiple repeating tasks for certain days of the week (per task, wanted to fill the whole week with various tasks and repeat them) for some reason, they would all sync to same weekdays. I enabled reminders but never had a reminder come up once and as far as I researched online this is a common problem on Android and hasn't been resolved for some time. So it seems I have to create a habit of opening this habit tracker app...";0
This app is either really good or really bad/broken --- there are no in betweens. I love the concept, and its super cute, but it bugs out quite a bit and besides which, is super easy to misclick on. As a result, I've lost or accidentally lost items, as well as accidentally spending nearly all of my coins completely on accident because there's no verification for buying and no refunding??? And that's besides the part where it constantly unequips all of my gear... This game needs help...;0
This app is a great idea with poor execution. Reminders only sometimes appear, and the UI can be very unresponsive - I've checked daily tasks off, only to find that the app interpreted this as UNchecking the task (since it hadn't registered the fact that it is a new day, yet), which actually subtracts the game resources from you. These problems are significant enough to make the RPG-like rewards system ineffective for me, and the app not worth using as a habit-tracker at this time, sadly.;0
The idea is wonderful. But a lot of tedious mistakes spoil the whole impression. For example, information is slowly updated even within the application, often clicking on a menu item is ignored. If you create a task without a title, but with a list, it will become closed for editing, just delete. Not all things are obvious. I had to read help to solve simple questions. Well, the old-school 8-bit graphics - not everyone likes it.;0
It would be a very helpful app if it actually worked the way you'd expect... if I say I want a task to be weekly, but make it so I can complete that task any day, what I'm trying to do, is make the task flexible, so I can do the weekly task whatever day of the week I feel like, instead however, making it available everyday turns it into a daily task, which I will be punished for by not completing daily, my only real solution at the moment is filling up my to-do list which is really frustrating.;0
Just had a big visual update but if anything the app is getting worse and worse. Now most of the time when I tap a plus sign to increase count of something, nothing happens. I have to drag down to refresh and then after it thinks for a minute it'll update the count. Or not, it kind of does what it wants at this point. I've mostly stopped using it because of this.;0
I like the concept because I've been trying to gamify my free time for a while, assigning a predifined score to each habit practiced the most during every hour, and all I wanted was the positive and the negative habits to affect the same progress bar, with the possibility to keep track of a daily score, with a possibly negative value. It's a damn shame but this aint for me. I wish it was more customisable;0
used it awhile ago and recently installed on my new phone. as soon as it opened it was clear i would not be able to use it. several things where off (like trying to put pictures in an office doc) worse still when i try to add many options are cut off by some form of white box that sits in the way. unfortunately dailies are one of the missing options and a huge part of how i personally used the app.;0
"it's a great idea but it just doesn't work! The pages never refresh for the next day, and if i press the refresh button it just comes up with an unable to connect to server error, or just stays with the loading symbol infinitely. I went on it today after not going on it for a couple of days and i just find that im dead out of nowhere. The ""refill health"" prompt kept repeatedly popping up and then when it stopped my health bar was still at zero. Also the add habit button isnt there always...";0
I immediately encountered a problem when I began, by misclicking on one of my Habits. There's no way to correct for that. Manually change the values, yes, but the xp and hp don't change to reflect that automatically. Secondly, the settings page is broken on my S9, and the issue is difficult to describe. The display freezes so if you scroll, an instance of the text moves while the another is stuck below. Honestly the tutorial really needs work. I could go on but space constraints.;0
I'm probably too old for this. Couldn't find the energy/patience to work out how it works (and why was it preset with meditation?), I guess it would seem obvious to someone who uses technology more. Bought a huge paper planner called Trigg instead. Less portable! But it won't crash, malfunction or lost if I break my phone...;0
Heres the thing. I love this app and the idea behind it. But for some reason its so dang glitchy. Pages wont always change when i scroll. Tasks dont refresh. I often have to completely close the app. Help! Very willing to change this review to 5 stars if we get this figured out.;0
Great concept, but really quite bad execution. With so many bugs even in the new player introduction it feels like an early access, not v2.2 of anything. Surprised to learn that it's been in public release for 4 years now. I would be ashamed to make or spend money from any transaction within this game. I'm not usually this harsh, and I hope none of the devs take this review personally, but get it together. Needs a major QOL & UX overhaul before I would consider the concept v1.0 complete.;0
I really enjoy this app but it has just stopped working randomly. I tried to hatch a dragon egg and the app crashed and since then I cant access it. I have tried uninstalling the app but nothing is working. I have even tried to use the website but it doesnt keep track of my exp gained. I am very dissapointed as I really like the idea of the app.;0
Couldn't really understand the purpose of using the app. It's either playing games or keeping track of habits, a bit confusing.;0
"I quite like habitica, but this app has some issues. The biggest problem for me is that switching the to do list to ""Scheduled"" is supposed to sort the to do items by due date (that's how it works on the website), but it doesn't. That makes the to do list (in the app) useless for me.";0
To be honest, it's a really good app. It has everything (simplicity, system, ui, etc.) but seriously, if this is really a productivity app, it needs to have an offline mode. Does it really need to have an internet connection every time someone has to check their to do list?;0
"Seems to have glitched out on me. When I put in my username and display name, it gave me an error saying ""Path Profile.Name Required."" Then none of the Avatar customization options appeared. I wasn't even able to start the third page when the app crashed. Reopening the app took me to the Dailies tutorial and now I'm sure I'm missing something. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.";0
latest update has not fixes bugs that occur every day.frustrating to use.sometimes it won't save,will just have a loading loop.Some basic things are not customizable like the calendar starting on Monday or the date format ,doesn't keep track of activity data correctly . Please focus on getting the app to work instead of focusing on superficial appearance! was thinking of paying for a subscription but what's the point if the money will not go towards making the app usable & less temperamental?;0
Very nice and interesting concept but completely useless because you flipping need wifi to update your checklist?! Furthermore even if my parents didn't control my wifi and I had full access, there should be a way to see all your tasks etc at a glance without having to scroll so much. Also what's the point if you can just go in the settings and set the amount of money you want? And a bunch of my friends joined habitica only to leave because it takes up too much time, and it's not fun enough.;0
I was using this app just fine without problems for about 2 months but when my wife decided to get us both a subscription, my account stopped working right. Whenever i check off a task i just get an error message and nothing gets counted. I did everything the helpers told me (clear cache, reinstall the app, restart phone) and nothing worked. Its been about a week and i have yet to hear again from technical support.;0
Need Wifi/Data for it. I get that you can play with your friends, but it would be nice if I could use it without wifi for data anyway. I have a limited ammout of data and brain memory. So by the time I get home after all day I've forgotten my habits and the point becomes mute. Only gave this an extra star because I love the 8 Bit art.;0
"Good app, but very buggy and support is completely unhelpful. There's no way to change your subscription level in the app or play store. Even if you cancel the app will think you're still subscribed. So basically when you pick a subscription level you are fully committed to it because the devs are too incompetent and uncaring to help. When using a choosing skill the habits n dailies show up like 10% of the time and the devs basically said ""oh well, we can't fix that"" when I mentioned it.";0
Please help. Relogging in after several months disuse. It has asked me to enter a username and it's stuck on 'username taken'. Will not let me progress to the app. I've tried every random letter/number combination so it's definitely not taken. Just buggy app?;0
Two bugs right at the beginning of registration. First two images didn't load on the three slides intro, then when registering my info, it moved to the next screen but gave a name error and I couldn't make an avatar. Not a good first impression. Just deleted my account thru the website.;0
I love the idea but it's not working on my Samsung S10e. Like the main screen is just purple when I first open and then the features for designing my character didn't show any options. I'll happily try again once bugs are worked out. Keep us posted!;0
this app would be 100x better if it incorporated some of the editting/customizing functions of the other to-do-list apps out there. i want to be able to strike through each of the to do items and view deleted/archived/completed items. be able to choose colors etc ..;0
Great concept. But I didn't build up coins quickly enough, and didn't get any gems, meaning I couldn't get anything new for my character. Honestly, a calendar and check-mark system would give me more incentive than this.;0
It's a great app. Really nice features. Does everything it says on the tin. But let me tell you: a productivity app won't do what it's meant to do unless it's usable offline. I really loved using it, but now I'm going back to the good old bullet journal.;0
The app looks interesting but it didn't work in my device which is a Samsung Galaxy Note9 , I couldn't see the introduction and I couldn't see my character in the character creation window it kept saying path profile.file is needed I don't know how to fix it;0
It would be better if there are more options for customising the avatar and theme which is in purple. You will need to spend money for a decent background. The avatar is pixelated and doesn't look good. Getting a bit bored of it now.;0
"Would you quit directing me to the website!? If I want to join a party/guild it should be done on the app. It won't let me log in on the site AT ALL.. Why you people would choose to have it so if you use ""log in using Google"", it resets and begins a whole new account without asking, now I have two accounts on one email? It won't even give me my password! I tried resetting it several times. How annoying, bad design. After I spent so much time on the app too, all for it not to work";0
It's a good app but it doesn't really work for me. Please provide an offline mode, because not everyone has data and Wi-Fi throughout the whole day. I will rate it 5 stars once there is an offline mode.;0
The idea behind the app is nice, but it isn't userfriendly. Finding and adding friends to use it together was so counter productive that it got us to waste time we could be actually doing our daily tasks.;0
I like the concept, but the execution needs work. In my experience, the app was laggy non-responsive at times which made the experience of creating and managing tasks tedious.;0
Couldn't get past registration/login. I've never used the app before but when I tried to make an account it said that my email has been taken and when I went to login it just kept loading forever.;0
Bug that says 'path 'type' is required' everytime I try to do something. I tried submittinf an error report through menu - about - report a bug, but I get the same error message when I try report the bug;0
I really liked this until I realized that unfinished daily/repeating tasks get marked as done whether you complete them or not the next day. That makes it pretty useless for tracking tasks I need to do each week.;0
Boring and not very effective for me: the visual design is a bit of a yawn and it's too hard to earn rewards without paying. If it works for you, great but it doesn't give me enough gratification.;0
I downloaded this app today but there is a problem that makes me unable to see to-do lists,habits etc. I really want to use this app but I can't do it when I can't see the options. It would be great if you fixed it so I can use it!;0
Does this works on android 10? I tried installing it and tried to make a character but it seems it's bugging. Doesn't show my character (from character-making phase). Reinstalled it, same thing occurred. Hopefully you guys can help me here. Cheers!;0
The app works great... with wifi. I love the feel of the app and desktop versions, but a decent chunk of my day is spent with limited/no wifi. I can't recommend it for that.;0
Galaxy S10 on Android 10. FTUE is busted. First two slides don't load. You get to the character creation and the avatar and all of the customize options are invisible/don't display. Please fix or mark the app as incompatible with Android 10.;0
Have been a user for years, but the app is borderline unusable at this point, it's not saving anything and is not connecting to servers. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, not sure what's wrong.;0
Super super buggy on my Note 8 . Can't press anything on the character creation menu after registering . Justin ( the tip guy ) ALWAYS comes up after pressing any of the menus . Super super annoying . please fix a.s.a.p;0
I really enjoyed this app but now if I delete a daily reminder I still get the notification for it! Which is highly annoying! Please fix this it distracts me from my work each time I here my notification go off for a deleted reminder;0
Several navigation options are inaccessible because they're underneath the home/back/tasks buttons at the bottom or within the notification/notch area at the top, making this app hard to use on my phone.;0
The app was working fine until it started bugging out recently and showing me the wrong dailies. Going back to using just the website now until this is fixed.;0
Why does the app keep showing server connection lost even though there is no problem with my network or internet server? I can't open the app and refresh it at all.;0
Incredible tool, awful app. I'd recommend the desktop version of this site to anyone but the app is a bug-ridden mess that overcomplicates simple functions and only works about 90% of the time.;0
Clunky and very slow to load. Not fun at all - just yet another task I had to deal with daily.;0
Very buggy first few times that I've used the app. Repeatedly having to close and reopen it for it to properly work.;0
"Interesting concept but I get a ""path type is required"" error all the time so I stopped using it";0
Set up was glitchy. I didnt get further than that. It's a great concept though and the art is cute.;0
It's been really helpful for habit building but it's now bugging like crazy and crashing every time I open it so not wonderful.;0
No landscape mode for tablets. I like the browser version, but landscape support is essential to me.;0
lost the ability to sort to dos by tags. very inconvenient. i used that feature a lot.;0
The app doesn't have any option to notify you, so last I played I had difficulty forming habits;0
The whole app is pretty broke on the note 9 (edit: I would love to report the big to help however, the settings menue does not work so I do not have the ability to send a report).;0
Laggiest experience ever, icons were missing everywhere, it seemed really cool but quite unplayable for me.;0
Change of days in app is a major problem. I wish it would happen smoothly.;0
Did not enjoy the layout, workflows, rewards, explanations. A+ for the effort.;0
Good ideas but not well implemented. It gets tedious and boring after a while.;0
Great concept, but can they hire an artist, this artwork is outdated!! otherwise I would use this;0
"it is fun but now i just level up and i don't get any notifs for ""unallocated stat points"" anymore";0
Very buggy and doesn't always show whole pages or lists.;0
upon using the app so far, i wish that it would be accessible offline. other than that, the idea to challenge yourself to earn points for your habits and chores is quite remarkable;0
Downloaded a bunch of these types of programs to find the one that was best. This was one of the worst. Played with it for about an hour and couldnt figure it out.;0
would like to change my my class and chat is IMPOSSIBLE to navigate. a simple notification system would make it easy.;0
Super glitchy. Too frustrating to bother trying to use it.;0
The app itself is quite good but without offline mode it's useless for me.;0
the app is awesome. but it made my phone drain 30% battery per day in the background which makes it useless;0
Let's be honest here, if you need help with basic habit management, you won't use this regularly enough to help. And if you're organized and have a good routine, you don't need it. A pointless novelty at best.;0
this app is closing down everytime I try to do anything but daily tasks. rather frustrating...;0
it keeps bugging out whenever i try to do anything. it wont stop doing ghe tutorial and wont ket me delete tast and stuff.;0
Certain pages don't fit on screen.;0
Can do better very complex to handle for newbies.;0
Awesome App.... BUT, soo many bugs!!;0
I keep running into problematic bugs right away;0
Doesn't connect at all. Pls fix it;0
Might help some, but isn't for me. It annoyed me more than it motivates me;0
The app is so good but it's completely destroyed by the fact that it's online for most things as far as i know you need internet and the point is that you can use this even when it's offline i hope they fix it after that it deserves all 5 stars;0
Too complicated, too many details;0
"Not for couples or friends. Subscription for ""teams"" to share tasks. Doesn't think money from their micro transactions shop is enough.";0
I tried buying gems but it doesn't look like I got the gems.... But my balance in the Google pay thing has gone down. Last time I throw away money on this app. Update: the gems showed up the following day. Not sure if that's because I emailed them about it or just it took several hours to go through.;0
The app itself is useful but they charged me three times for one subscription and will not respond to me when I email them.;0
The app doesn't have any option to notify you, so last I played I had difficulty forming habits;0
Idk what happened, but from the start app was just alright, and it was very nice and I was happy that i found it. But since a few hours it just stopped working! When I'm trying to complete the task it just doesn't count. The mark is appears, but several seconds later it vanishes!!! And also when I'm trying to complete a part of assignment it doesn't count. Please fix :(;0
Couldn't really understand the purpose of using the app. It's either playing games or keeping track of habits, a bit confusing.;0
It takes too long to be fun, and sets you up for failure. At the start you are asked to create a small # of tasks. However, the number of tasks you do is directly related to how fast you level. And a few tasks means it takes a LONG time to get to level 10 which is when you finally get to pick a class. However, you could level faster if you add more tasks, but doing that before you are ready will set you up to fail. This is not discouraged as it should be, and there few goals at lower levels.;0
I keep running into problematic bugs right away;0
Was really really excited for this, but then it's glitchy (I ended up with tons of duplicates of the habits which takes forever to delete cause you can only delete individually) and it relies on internet, so I can't use it for when I'm out. Oh well :((;0
No good as other applications but good for games and one task or goal like da daily routines work;0
Seems like it could be fun, I just had a hard time getting into it.;0
fun and helpful. graphics are awesome. just needs a few tweaks. too easy to cheat. i don't like the tavern because i am in recovery from drugs and alcohol so it's kinda anthemic. maybe a temple option would be a better social forum for inclusion for those of us who don't drink and/or use drugs. it would also be nice if you could continue to see completed to-do items after you have checked them so you can continue to visualize your progress.;0
Make a go back button;0
Excited to try it out, but the app crashes whenever I try to create or edit tasks!;0
"Was ok until i saw the mtx. I guess it truely does ""gamify"" things now.";0
"Despite various updates to ""fix bugs"" the first few screens of this app are still completely broken on Android. The app beyond sign-in still functions...but that's it. The game aspect is weak, the app isn't very well designed, and the tutorials tend to be broken on Android as well. I prefer apps like Fabulous, which I think approaches the subject of mental health and habit forming in a much better way.";0
Set up was glitchy. I didnt get further than that. It's a great concept though and the art is cute.;0

I have to drag down to refresh and then after it thinks for a minute it'll update the count. Or not, it kind of does what it wants at this point. I've mostly stopped using it because of this.;0
"Interesting concept but I get a ""path type is required"" error all the time so I stopped using it";0
requires an account;0
used it awhile ago and recently installed on my new phone. as soon as it opened it was clear i would not be able to use it. several things where off (like trying to put pictures in an office doc) worse still when i try to add many options are cut off by some form of white box that sits in the way. unfortunately dailies are one of the missing options and a huge part of how i personally used the app.;0
it keeps bugging out whenever i try to do anything. it wont stop doing ghe tutorial and wont ket me delete tast and stuff.;0
"I love the idea of this app. Unfortunately, it is not super user friendly. I've been using it for over a month and it is not very obvious how to complete quests or anything else. (and yes, I have gone through the FAQs) I finally figured out how to hatch eggs, but that's all. It's a pretty clunky app as a ""game"" but it does a pretty good job of keeping me accountable for things. That's the only reason I haven't deleted it. As a ""Gamify your life"" app, I'm not convinced. Hopefully it improves!";0
"I quite like habitica, but this app has some issues. The biggest problem for me is that switching the to do list to ""Scheduled"" is supposed to sort the to do items by due date (that's how it works on the website), but it doesn't. That makes the to do list (in the app) useless for me.";0
Needs a VPN if you're in China. Some questionable UI and design choices, though the fundamentals work well for the most part. If you want to do anything remotely interesting then you have to pay, of course. And the subscription fees are absolutely extortionate. One month is the same price as a month of Netflix and a year is £47. A year of MS Office 365 with all of its functionality is £60... Let that sink in. I don't understand why, for relatively little, this app costs so much. Greed, I assume.;0
"I couldn't get past the set-up. ""'strength is not valid enum value path 'attitude'""";0
two stars bc i have adhd AND i REALLY wanted it to work. it isn't user friendly and i can't give it the time of day to sit and figure it out. I'll try again later.... maybe this fall?;0
It's completely a mess. Can't understand what to do and where.;0
Couldn't get past registration/login. I've never used the app before but when I tried to make an account it said that my email has been taken and when I went to login it just kept loading forever.;0
Not really interesting. Doesn't help if you don't have a discipline already in place.;0
Great concept, but can they hire an artist, this artwork is outdated!! otherwise I would use this;0
Too hard;0
The dailies and habits should reset everyday.please let them reset;0
Can do better very complex to handle for newbies.;0
Some my tasks and habits dissappear. There aren't any in completed.;0
would like to change my my class and chat is IMPOSSIBLE to navigate. a simple notification system would make it easy.;0
Great concept, but riddled with bugs. Sign up was horribly difficult, with the servers not responding and the app failing to realize I was trying to change my username and display names. App reset at around 7:00 pm, instead of at midnight of my time zone, which I had double checked beforehand. I want to like it, but this is becoming downright frustrating.;0
this app is closing down everytime I try to do anything but daily tasks. rather frustrating...;0
Have been a user for years, but the app is borderline unusable at this point, it's not saving anything and is not connecting to servers. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, not sure what's wrong.;0
The app works great... with wifi. I love the feel of the app and desktop versions, but a decent chunk of my day is spent with limited/no wifi. I can't recommend it for that.;0
Bug that says 'path 'type' is required' everytime I try to do something. I tried submittinf an error report through menu - about - report a bug, but I get the same error message when I try report the bug;0
Awesome App.... BUT, soo many bugs!!;0
I like the concept, but the execution needs work. In my experience, the app was laggy non-responsive at times which made the experience of creating and managing tasks tedious.;0
Not user-friendly;0
Incredible tool, awful app. I'd recommend the desktop version of this site to anyone but the app is a bug-ridden mess that overcomplicates simple functions and only works about 90% of the time.;0
It's been really helpful for habit building but it's now bugging like crazy and crashing every time I open it so not wonderful.;0
I wish it was offline, like people may not have an internet connection always and it will be a little annoying to see that you can't move forward without internet. Also I can find an option to repeat my to do list . Like in Google task you can set a time for it to remind you what to do and also you can make it repeat. It's sad that a app like this doesn't have such a basic thing.;1
Maybe implement something that categorises and levels up specific areas, such as creativity, language, programming, DIY, home, gardening, hygiene, fitness, culinary skills etc. Everything seems to just bundle into general exp.;1
This is a great app, I really enjoy using it! There are a few minor bugs here and there, but nothing serious that prevents functionality. You can access Guilds to chat with people about various topics and check off everything you need to do in a day with a little helpful motivation from party members. Definitely would recommend this app for those who are motivated for the next level up!;1
This is a fun way to build the keystone habit you need to make all your other daily habits click into place. I think the mechanic of guilds is probably one of the most engaging things about it. My critique is that in order to access the challenges available from the guilds you're in, you have to get on your desktop. This is super annoying because I'd rather only use the mobile app. Fix this and it's an easy five stars.;1
I enjoyed using this app for over the past 2 years to improve my life, even if it was by a little bit. The community is kind and friendly. But I think it would be better if you could filter out what type of guild you want to join. I don't want to spend too much time scrolling down just to find the right guild.;1
Great interface and concept. What I appreciate most that other apps don't do is that they distinguish between habits, dailies, and to do's!! Props. Also I love the guilds concept as well. One suggestion is maybe have a clear visualization tool too see the progress made. But I get it the point of this app is to level up your avatar! Overall good job 👌;1
This app has actually really made a difference in my life. I am so grateful BUT I feel it could be WAY better. Can you add in: A Timer (for workouts) and perhaps Minigames?? (The higher level your character the more powerful stuff like that 😀😀) Thank you devs!;1
It's a great app, and it's fun and intuitive to use! But I do have one concern. Clear notifications button is not working as of the moment.;1
App is pretty good but everytime I add an item to my to-do list or habits etc it goes back to the party tab. So annoying to go back to tasks every time I add something;1
"Wish there were different ""skins"" for the app beyond fantasy, e.g. sci-fi, horror, real life, etc.";1
This app has become my life. I truly love it. It helps me work towards my goals in a very fun&supportive environment. My down points would be (mainly) because of gems. While the game is free, there are certain things you can only get through buying gems. Which is understandable, they need to be able to support themselves&the game. My problem is that while you can earn them for free, it's damn near impossible to compete with 200+ people in one challenge and get rewarded.;1
I have used Habitica for a year now, and I would suggest this app to anyone who wants to meet people with the same goal of building healthy habits. I have met amazing people, battled in hard quests which driven me to finish my dailies, and joined a variety of challenges! The app still has some glitches here and there, but I mostly use the website.;1
The app is what you make of it. A big imagination will take you far. I wish it had better mobile support though. Many functions require a computer. And it'd be nice to be able to preview all the cosmetic options that cost gems (the cash currency). Without a preview, its almost gambling, especially with hairstyles;1
Great to-do list app with addicting premise, but can't remove glasses customization option once they're on. Please change this! I don't want my avatar to have glasses and can't remove them since the option doesn't appear to let me do so. Will change review to 5 stars once this is fixed;1
At fırst it seems complicated, bu after some days you will find it handy and usefull;1
Love this app and use it daily! Great for task managing and motivation if you like games and collecting things! :) There are a couple of bugs though, and the app does not support some of the features available in the web version which i find a bit odd. The phone is the best place to keep a to-do list as it's always with you so i dont understand why the app isn't a priority. Im also missing an option to search or filter my inventory. Other than that i really like it.;1
Good base. Needs greater rewards and harsher punishments. Include more visual/audio cues for success and failure. Take notes from other games that make a big show out to clicking a button, which heightens the stimulation the player recieves.;1
This is one of the best apps for self improvement available for gamers. The idea, the execution, the design, amazing. My only gripe is that the error messages you get only sorta explain what went wrong and I have not successfully used the stat correction page once. Always error messages. Hopefully these bugs get worked out.;1
I love this game. It has helped me do much It's a bit of a learning curve. It would be nice if challenges were visible from the app in all of the guilds, and I would also like to see the last day and time that a habit was marked, because the colors don't always change and if you have a lot of habits it gets confusing. Otherwise, this app is brilliantly done and will be getting my monetary support in whatever way I can afford.;1
Habitica is the best productivity app I've used thus far. It lasted me for months. The quests are the most motivating feature, and I was able to take down a couple bosses solo. However, motivation dried up weeks into my first fetch quest because despite being extremely productive, I had no chance of finding even one shard. Unless you're comfortable teaming up with a bunch of strangers to take on quests, there becomes a point when being solo makes the quest motivation feature impossible.;1
This app actually made me want to stick to my habits. The money/exp system is kind of broken and arbitrary. Fun way to think about your habits as life skills and the more you do it the better you get at it.;1
Great for getting Organizated. Not sure how the social aspects of quests and guilds work/play into dayily actities.;1
I love this app and all my friends use it and compete against each other. This is a brilliant concept! however the app seems a bit buggy. I was in beta programme and then I was unable to send invites or buy certain items. I thought it's because of beta being unstable so I opted out of beta and reinstalled the app, still didn't fix the issue. I'm the party leader and the group isnset so that only I can start quests, still anyone starts a quest without me knowing and I don't face this on browser.;1
So far I like it, however there are so many items on the lists when you first download it that it gave me anxiety. You can only delete them 1 at a time and it wants confirmation before deleting each one. If the developers see this I suggest only a few items on each list to give as an example instead of the 200+ I found on my lists that all repeated. Although the check here for downloading the app gave a lot of XP.;1
I was introduced to this app by a friend, and it definitely didn't disappoint. The task manager is very fun to use and is extremely customizable, and the events and group activities make it even more fun, though the menu navigation could be improved, as well as the rewards for doing tasks, because I don't feel too motivated to do the tasks still;1
It worked fine for a while, but now every time I click on a task/habit/goal to edit, the app crashes. I can tick off the task and plus on the habit just fine, but I can't edit anything now... Please look into fixing it soon? Edit: thank you, the latest update fixed it all!;1
Turning your life into a RPG is a great way to stay motivated. If they can provide something like a monthly habit tracker, it would be great;1
Pretty good app. However, there's a point where I'm not making much progress unless I have gems. I understand why the gems are there, but as someone who isn't willing to spend money on an app, it makes it a little boring. Overall, great experience and helped with my habit building.;1
Great app and service! The user base is amazing and the staff is awesome. No notification when a challenge ends and no way to automatically remove its associated tasks. Can't read the full text of challenge tasks before joining. The health/experience widget doesn't display any information.;1
Great app! I would like more progression content. Resetting levels is easy implementation, but gets stale quickly. Mages do too much damage. But this app had been transformative and amazing. I will consider contributing to development.;1
Love it, keeps me motivated but you should add something to share and make my friends join, like an invite, not the one you share your level up;1
Love it but would love it more if I could look into the future to see what I have scheduled easily;1
Love the concept behind the app!! I feel silly but it still works. I am able to complete most of my tasks. My only suggestion would be: please, let the characters not be pixellated.;1
The auto populated list of dailies was never-ending and repetitive. Who needs to floss 30 times a day? I died because i didn't take the time to delete each one individually. Honestly when i scrolled down to try to find the end i couldn't find it and felt i was making no progress in deleting the duplicates.;1
Such a thoughtful self-help app. Life saving for ADHD. THANK YOU for the wheelchair option in the icon... the diversity was such a nice surprise. I do wish there were different task layouts to choose from for the front page -- I'm just easily confused I guess! Thank you staff.;1
I enjoy the app very much and it's helping me kick some bad habits. The only thing I'm not a big fan of is that it often times does not auto refresh after clicking an item or useing food. Other than that, I like the app a lot.;1
Great Concept, good community functions but some additional advice/tutorial and examples for planning your day / tasks with this app would be great;1
Perfect app but you need to add night mode;1
it has very very few bugs in the mobile app but i love it!;1
Hey guys great game but I'm a mage and my mana keeps changing itll go to 300 and then ill level up and itll drop back down to 268, its been doing that for a few days please help us :);1
It's cute, but the fact that I cannot view a calendar with my progress kills it for me. I am going to stick to Loop app.;1
Please add archiving for stagnant dailies;1
Great concept! Has me waking up on schedule and doing my tasks so I dont loose life and earn exp! Just one thing. I cant do quests. I got the dust bunnies quest but I have no clue what to do with it. Help?;1
Great app so far, still not sure about how everyting works...please can you create some warrior monk feature? (like shaolin rope, ecc.) Good job anyway!;1
I wish there was more interaction with party quests;1
I couldn't change the language of this software, I tried it again and again, but the language didn't change.;1
Great app for those who need extra motivation This is just my idea, but why don't add timed to-do (in image of monsters or something) that will reduce the health of the protagonist (or any negative effects) if they did not finish it on time It may as well push the user to work immediately later than procrastinate, I think I got more ideas but will be too long to write here, so... Anyway, nice app, cool app;1
It was amazing! I just didn't have the time to set it up all the way.;1
I've tried quite a few rpg-like to-do list apps and I must say this one is the only one that I find genuinely enjoyable, and actually kinda feels like a game. You can tell a lot of effort was put into the aesthetic, everything is very easy to access and is pleasing to the eye. Although I think there should be a way to uncheck to-do's. I keep accidentally clicking on them in the widget and remaking them every time is starting to get annoying.;1
Love habit forming features! Wishing for more heirarchy in to do lists.;1
This app is really cool and can help build many habits and keep track of to do lists. However I would like options to customizer the avatar more? Like I accidentally added glasses and there isn't a option for none. Can you please add it?;1
This app is awesome could use better graphics but overall the idea of it is legit af;1
I really like the app but the downside is no offline mode, this will be a better app if it had an offline mode.;1
So far so good, you have to be willing to set on the app for a bit to figure it out. It's a rpg game based off of truth. The app does freeze fairly frequently but you just have to close it and reopen it and everything is back in order.;1
Need a combination for habits and dailies;1
Guys - I really want to like this app more and give it 5 stars! Everything is there and I can see the work and effort that has gone into making it so thank you so much! But on Android the habits screen is quite buggy and won't let me adjust the streaks. The keyboard comes up but closes immediately so I can't do anything. The dailies work fine. I look forward to any updates you're planning but considering this is free, I think what you've achieved is great!;1
A really great idea with a lot of great features! I love it a lot. However, it's a bit unresponsive at times. Actions that previously worked will occasionally not go through for mystery reasons . And the widgets, while displaying correctly, have bad interactivity. Thats said, the art is cute, the features are helpful and extensive, and the positive impact it has on my habits is amazing;1
I would have reported this as a bug within the app, but I found another bug when trying to do that. First one: when submitting a bug or feedback, it does not pass through the 'To' address into the email, so I'm not sure where to send it to. Second one: when editing a habit, daily or to-do text field, the keyboard pops up and disappears. A workaround on this (for my device) is to rotate the phone landscape. Using pixel 3. Otherwise, a very good app!;1
I really like the concept of this app, the style, the features, and it has done its part in motivating my studies and organizing my life. However, the app needs some serious redesigning. The layout is difficult to navigate and the chat function is almost useless. The way challenges are organized could also use improvement. All in all, I like using it (make an account a month ago), but the functionality needs to be improved;1
A little buggy sometimes but all is forgiven for how much this app helps me be a more productive and motivated person. I have one request, please add some sort of real life stat tracker. The idea would be to assign tasks, habits, or dailies to certain skill categories and you could track points, levels, or hours for certain skills. For example, this would be cool for me to keep track of my progress towards mastery as a woodworker or painter etc.;1
Cute app. Could do with a more user-easy interface for the lazy out there but nice little motivator;1
love the idea! but the execution is kind of clumsy. there's little to no guidance with regard to how parties or challenges work, and the rewards seem to be random at best. the graphics are adorable and the app definitely has potential though! but it would be more user friendly to streamline the app because it can be overwhelming with so many choices and options (i.e. mounts, food, eggs, etc) that seem mostly arbitrary.;1
"This app has been so helpful for me to be more productive, as i didnt take care kf myself before! i can't complain about anything, except sometimes when i first log in for the day, my dailies will be from yesterday and will take a minute to switch to today. I would love to see why so-and-so points are being deducted when you take damage from missed dailies! Like.... ""Clean (medium): -6 Health"" or something like that. I don't think I'll ever delete this app, and i look forward to any updates!";1
I'm just starting out with Habitica and am liking it so far, but the To-Dos would be much more useful if they could be organized by due date. I've got like 25 things on that list, with due dates over the next two weeks or so, and it would be much easier to actually accomplish these things if I could easily see which were the most urgent instead of having to scroll up and down and compare dates in a mental tally.;1
I've been using this app since the beginning of December and it has really helped me with keeping on track with tasks and developing habits. However, there are a few issues with the party features. When a message is sent in the chat, no one is notified and we cannot respond appropriately unless we actively check. The chat and members tab also tends to not load up and I have to leave the app in order for it to work again. Navigating the app is also quite a hassle but it isn't a major issue.;1
Great app, stability is still a bit shakey but you never lose anything even if there is a crash. Join this community if you are serious about getting your act together and having as much fun as you can while doing it. You get what you put into this and you don't have to pay a penny if you don't want to. But in my experience, when you meet the amazing people this place attracts, you'll find yourself getting more and more involved and wanting to contribute however you can.;1
"Very nice app for productivity. My favorite feature is that tasks and dailies that are finished can he hidden. However, it requires connection too much. Wouldn't mind syncing from time to time but I'd really hope there could be a way to tick off tasks even offline. Also would love to see ""weeklies"" or something that doesn't reset everyday for goals like ""go to gym 3x this week"" or ""walk dogs 5x this week"". Integration of calendar events would also be nice.";1
I only started using it yesterday, and so far it is interesting, and I think it will be useful. I'd give it 4.5 stars, but that isn't an option, so 4 it is, for now. I'd really like to see a better way to organize Dailies, preferably alphabetically, so tasks I tag as Morning will show up before Night (though admittedly, that wouldn't help if I labeled any 'Afternoon' or 'Noon').;1
It has been an effective motivator and tracker for me to accomplish the smaller tasks that get me closer towards my bigger goals. But there seems to be a Bug - I can't seem to receive a friend's Party invite, though I am able to create my own party and invite friends to it. It's a one way street in my app! Joining guilds and the self-care, self-sabotage info have been most educational and helpful.;1
A fun way to get into habits. Makes me want to do things in real life as I find it very rewarding. I think it would be helpful if there was a timestamp on the dailies/habits as to when you last checked the item off. I don't have the best memory and feel like some days I double up on certain tasks because I can't remember if I've checked it off or not alredy 😅 I would like to see how long it has been since I last did a task, again, I often forget. Other than that it's fantastic!;1
"The app is a great concept helping me keep track of goals and be motivated to do the things I need to in a day. Friendly competition and cooperation keep things interesting and encouraging. Quests are wonderful long term motivation, along with the goal of filling the stable. It is discouraging, frustrating and hurtful when I try to check off dailies (or do ANYTHING on the app) and it doesn't let me because of connection failures. I lost health overnight because it didn't let me check off my dailies? Especially frustrating during quests. Myself and friends all have the ""connection problems"" in different locations on data, or wifi at the same time... Fixes are quick, and interactions/responses pleasant! Great app!";1
I like the app a lot, but some features are a little annoying. I have a few suggestions. - More ways to tweak what the widgets look like (currently they take up a lot of space). - It would be nice to see the completed tasks together with active tasks instead of them disappearing. - Task subcategories! Please! 💚 - Biggest gripe: because of the way the entire list item is like a button, I keep accidentally checking tasks that weren't actually done. +Bugged unchecking. Pls fix. Thanks💚💚💚;1
I have been using Habitica for quite some time now and i must say, it has been the most useful in helping me establish a structure to my day. HOWEVER, the To-Dos are very limited in its functions. It's hard to implement a full task management (such as GTD methodology). It pretty much only supports next action steps, not any layers such as Projects or Waiting For. Also, syncing across devices can sometimes be problematic I hope they will improve the To-Dos and make syncing smoother.;1
"Have been looking for a way to incorporate the elements of gaming into making progress ""In Real Life"". Even tried inventing something for myself but paper tracking was a nightmare and having it in this app is just fantastic! Really like it and it has made a big difference! The only reason I took it down a star is because it depletes my phone battery really fast if I am in the app for very long, such as when I am shopping or browsing challenges, so I do these things mostly on my PC. Overall, great job! Would recommend this to anyone that enjoys gaming but is struggling with motivation in the real world.";1
So far it's pretty good. I've been using it about a week. Sometimes it doesn't refresh, but the other users on the app seem positive and friendly. There is a lot that I am learning through users that isn't actually explained in the app. Like if you don't do all your daily tasks, the whole party takes damage. So yeah, no pressure! It would be nice for a better help options or a more detailed in-app-fist-time training/learning session. Every 'first' should option for more info!;1
Great concept. Reminders do not work and from some quick research it appears this has been an issue for literal years now. I was really hoping I could have the app remind me of tasks instead of setting a hundred alarms on my phone. I'd prefer not to have both. I'd really appreciate if reminders would actually work.;1
Really enjoy the app, probably wouldnt recommend unless you have someone to do it with. Also, please set up a system of 'weekly' tasks, currently you can only set a daily that you complete once a week but it would be nice to have the flexibility of doing a task any day that week without being penalised.;1
I love this app alot. theres just two things I would really love to see added. it would be great if you allowed us to choose to have a habit set up for like 3 times out of the week, without picking which days of the week. I also really wish I could have more than 4 habits, is there a way to do that? it's a great app, thanks so much;1
The idea is good, but the app can be made better with some performance optimisation. For example, when I launch the app, it takes at least 3 seconds to synchronize and restart my habit list with the correct status. And all pop-ups only appear with a 2sec delay. Overall I like the idea, by I'm moving onto other habit tracker apps because this kind of gamification isn't for me :) Appreciate the app.;1
Pretty great app, motivates me to do stuff I normally wouldn't want to because of the prospect of leveling up. One small gripe I have is that if something with a reminder is marked complete before the reminder goes off, it still reminds you even though you've already done it. Also, sounds when you mark something, etc come out the Ringtone channel, not the Media channel.;1
I guess I love it as it kind of works? I mean this is as good as an app can get for it's purpose. It has the perfect amount of features and completely customizable. The biggest problem I have is at the beginning it's very challenging to keep alive (as you have no party/armour yet) and also as far as I'm aware I could only edit the order of the dailies, I wish they can be done to other sectors too.;1
Great idea and I'm enjoying it so far. Chores and errands are much more fun. My one gripe so far is that it seems like most items/quests cost gems, which are pay to play. I'm afraid i'll pretty quickly run out of free items/quests to strive for and then the app will lose its effectiveness. It'd be helpful if their were other ways to unlock gems outside of paying for them, like reaching extra high levels of productivity/habit building, etc.;1
clever stuff. great concept that is already working on me, especially like the widgets, they made it really functional. Only 4 star as the walkthrough wasnt close toenough to get to grips with the game fully, i still dont actually know why my health resets or how to increase health dispite adding healthy eating and exercise. it seems like there is some mechanic somewhere to battle with your guy, but not explained anywhere, adding in some kind of quests or mini-game would be the icing on the cake;1
This has been really engaging in my tasks and goals and I am just at day two of using it. For the app, it would be cool if there was a notification for any chat threads users are on so if anybody had a follow-up question, I would be able to return to the inquiry and add more to the discussion if needed.;1
I've been using this app for about a year now, I think. I love keeping myself accountable, and tracking what I'm doing and what I'm not each day. Lately, I've been getting push notifications for every single message that members of my party are sending in chat, none of which mention me. I've switched off push notifications completely but they're still coming through all the time. This is the only thing stopping me from giving 5 stars!;1
I just want to say that the tutorial was too much info, things like this should be explained in a short and concise way, at a good pace. It was just too long and too much to take in. I didn't even try the app though, I can't say what rating it deserves. I am unnistalling but I may come back to it in the future, it's not you, it's me. (Also, you can't delete your account on mobile but you can on desktop. I suggest people to try the desktop version since it may have more features);1
I LOVE habitica, however I m think the app misses a lot of functionality when compared with website. For example the challenges in a guild is not displayed and the task detail in challenges are also not displayed. I mainly used the web version, but it would be great if there are not much differences between the website and this app!;1
I used this all the time before, and it was fun in the beginning, but got really tired of the low res graphics! If they were a bit more high def, it would be amazing! we could finally see the equipment customization better - more motivating to continue using and complete tasks.;1
This app has really helped me get my stuff in order! It also has an active community and good challenges! It is a bit glitchy at times (things don't refresh, etc) but overall it's great! Edit: lol, the 'report a bug' is glitched on my phone :P I had to manually send my info over, in the middle of fixing a glitch where my day won't reset - been broken for a week.;1
I'm easily motivated by things like points and streaks, so this app works really well for me to increase my productivity and decrease my anxiety. I use rewards for breaks, and find that I get unpleasant but short tasks done much more often, because I can earn breaks quickly by just getting them over with. I also get my long, complicated, multi-part projects done early. I gave it four stars because there are a couple of features I'd like to see, but it works great as is.;1
Cool app, but I wish I could see everything I own at once. When I get a new item, I have to search every inventory screen to figure out where is went. Confusing for new players. Also, if you don't have a party, it's basically a checklist since all the gane modes are forced multiplayer.;1
"Make it easier to understand when you're activating quests. I didn't have anyone in my party by I was still somehow doing it and finished it by myself without realizing it. Make a design change/renaming so that there's something labeled ""start quest"". Still a fun and useful app. Growth is neverending";1
I like it a lot. But it doesn't have as much of the GAME aspect to it. I wish there was a feature where you character could actually play in an rpg game using the equipment and skills you earned. You could have a little rpg game on the side and has cute little morality stories. Without it, it doesn't really incentivize much.;1
since the May 1st update it made me create my character 15+ times before I uninstalled and reinstalled before having to do it again and spending close to 45 minutes deleting pre generated habits dailies and to dos to get to my original ones. Terrible. I love the app otherwise. Update: since the new update it is fixed.;1
Health widget stopped working after latest Android update. Note 8. AT&T. Interesting take on habit forming. I'm not really a gamer but I like the point system, leveling up, and buying accessories for your avatar with those points. Nerdy fun that seems to actually be motivating me in a way other habit trackers haven't been able to. (The TED talk on the inspiration for this app is really interesting too.);1
Just downloaded the app.Loving the idea of adding my own habits & to do stuff which i used to tick off daily on notepad(uff) ,now I am glad its automated with rewards too!!.(yay!)Have a suggestion to make all sections of list tabs movable up/down (like the rewards section) to organise as per customisable preference.(-:);1
This is a very helpful and fun way to get yourself in the habit of doing things. The Daily Tasks are a fantastic way to get your daily stuff handled and check them off within the app. You've got the ability to create To-Do lists with due dates and notification reminders can make it ridiculously simple to get even the most complex task completed. On top of all this, seeing your character earn experience, new items and getting pets and mounts turns all the monotony into a wickedly AWESOME RPG.;1
This productivity app is amazing for anyone looking to gamify their life. I've been using this for about half a year and it's made a difference in motivating me to be productive. The app can act up sometimes however, with it syncing my activities properly, but other than that, this app is great!;1
Amazing app. Really motivating with an online support team. But so long as its online only its hard to depend on it.;1
"Wish there were different ""skins"" for the app beyond fantasy, e.g. sci-fi, horror, real life, etc.";1
Please add archiving for stagnant dailies;1
Maybe implement something that categorises and levels up specific areas, such as creativity, language, programming, DIY, home, gardening, hygiene, fitness, culinary skills etc. Everything seems to just bundle into general exp.;1
Cool but really confusing;1
I wish it was offline, like people may not have an internet connection always and it will be a little annoying to see that you can't move forward without internet. Also I can find an option to repeat my to do list . Like in Google task you can set a time for it to remind you what to do and also you can make it repeat. It's sad that a app like this doesn't have such a basic thing.;1
At fırst it seems complicated, bu after some days you will find it handy and usefull;1
This is a great app, I really enjoy using it! There are a few minor bugs here and there, but nothing serious that prevents functionality. You can access Guilds to chat with people about various topics and check off everything you need to do in a day with a little helpful motivation from party members. Definitely would recommend this app for those who are motivated for the next level up!;1
Great for getting Organizated. Not sure how the social aspects of quests and guilds work/play into dayily actities.;1
É um App bem legal para organizar tarefas simples do dia a dia. Ainda estou aprendendo a usar, mas achei bem divertido.;1
Love it but would love it more if I could look into the future to see what I have scheduled easily;1
I enjoyed using this app for over the past 2 years to improve my life, even if it was by a little bit. The community is kind and friendly. But I think it would be better if you could filter out what type of guild you want to join. I don't want to spend too much time scrolling down just to find the right guild.;1
App is pretty good but everytime I add an item to my to-do list or habits etc it goes back to the party tab. So annoying to go back to tasks every time I add something;1
This app has actually really made a difference in my life. I am so grateful BUT I feel it could be WAY better. Can you add in: A Timer (for workouts) and perhaps Minigames?? (The higher level your character the more powerful stuff like that 😀😀) Thank you devs!;1
I really like the app but the downside is no offline mode, this will be a better app if it had an offline mode.;1
It's a great app, and it's fun and intuitive to use! But I do have one concern. Clear notifications button is not working as of the moment.;1
Cute app. Could do with a more user-easy interface for the lazy out there but nice little motivator;1
This is a fun way to build the keystone habit you need to make all your other daily habits click into place. I think the mechanic of guilds is probably one of the most engaging things about it. My critique is that in order to access the challenges available from the guilds you're in, you have to get on your desktop. This is super annoying because I'd rather only use the mobile app. Fix this and it's an easy five stars.;1
Perfect app but you need to add night mode;1
Great interface and concept. What I appreciate most that other apps don't do is that they distinguish between habits, dailies, and to do's!! Props. Also I love the guilds concept as well. One suggestion is maybe have a clear visualization tool too see the progress made. But I get it the point of this app is to level up your avatar! Overall good job 👌;1
Love habit forming features! Wishing for more heirarchy in to do lists.;1
Need a combination for habits and dailies;1
Turning your life into a RPG is a great way to stay motivated. If they can provide something like a monthly habit tracker, it would be great;1
This app has become my life. I truly love it. It helps me work towards my goals in a very fun&supportive environment. My down points would be (mainly) because of gems. While the game is free, there are certain things you can only get through buying gems. Which is understandable, they need to be able to support themselves&the game. My problem is that while you can earn them for free, it's damn near impossible to compete with 200+ people in one challenge and get rewarded.;1
I have used Habitica for a year now, and I would suggest this app to anyone who wants to meet people with the same goal of building healthy habits. I have met amazing people, battled in hard quests which driven me to finish my dailies, and joined a variety of challenges! The app still has some glitches here and there, but I mostly use the website.;1
Hi kindly show highest streak for a habbit. Which will act as high score to break the next time and we keep on improving our streaks!!! Sorry i took away a star.;1
Hey guys great game but I'm a mage and my mana keeps changing itll go to 300 and then ill level up and itll drop back down to 268, its been doing that for a few days please help us :);1
Good but have more levels;1
it has very very few bugs in the mobile app but i love it!;1
Love it, keeps me motivated but you should add something to share and make my friends join, like an invite, not the one you share your level up;1
Great Concept, good community functions but some additional advice/tutorial and examples for planning your day / tasks with this app would be great;1
This app is really cool and can help build many habits and keep track of to do lists. However I would like options to customizer the avatar more? Like I accidentally added glasses and there isn't a option for none. Can you please add it?;1
This app actually made me want to stick to my habits. The money/exp system is kind of broken and arbitrary. Fun way to think about your habits as life skills and the more you do it the better you get at it.;1
I wish there was more interaction with party quests;1
Great to-do list app with addicting premise, but can't remove glasses customization option once they're on. Please change this! I don't want my avatar to have glasses and can't remove them since the option doesn't appear to let me do so. Will change review to 5 stars once this is fixed;1
Great app for those who need extra motivation This is just my idea, but why don't add timed to-do (in image of monsters or something) that will reduce the health of the protagonist (or any negative effects) if they did not finish it on time It may as well push the user to work immediately later than procrastinate, I think I got more ideas but will be too long to write here, so... Anyway, nice app, cool app;1
It deserves more than 4.2★. I'd rate it 4.5 for productivity.;1
Neat!;1
Good base. Needs greater rewards and harsher punishments. Include more visual/audio cues for success and failure. Take notes from other games that make a big show out to clicking a button, which heightens the stimulation the player recieves.;1
Nice;1
The app is what you make of it. A big imagination will take you far. I wish it had better mobile support though. Many functions require a computer. And it'd be nice to be able to preview all the cosmetic options that cost gems (the cash currency). Without a preview, its almost gambling, especially with hairstyles;1
Amazing app. Really motivating with an online support team. But so long as its online only its hard to depend on it.;1
I enjoy the app very much and it's helping me kick some bad habits. The only thing I'm not a big fan of is that it often times does not auto refresh after clicking an item or useing food. Other than that, I like the app a lot.;1
Need to register before use;1
I love this app and all my friends use it and compete against each other. This is a brilliant concept! however the app seems a bit buggy. I was in beta programme and then I was unable to send invites or buy certain items. I thought it's because of beta being unstable so I opted out of beta and reinstalled the app, still didn't fix the issue. I'm the party leader and the group isnset so that only I can start quests, still anyone starts a quest without me knowing and I don't face this on browser.;1
Pretty good app. However, there's a point where I'm not making much progress unless I have gems. I understand why the gems are there, but as someone who isn't willing to spend money on an app, it makes it a little boring. Overall, great experience and helped with my habit building.;1
Getting my work done in a motivational way, with friends in a group! :D;1
Love the concept behind the app!! I feel silly but it still works. I am able to complete most of my tasks. My only suggestion would be: please, let the characters not be pixellated.;1
I was introduced to this app by a friend, and it definitely didn't disappoint. The task manager is very fun to use and is extremely customizable, and the events and group activities make it even more fun, though the menu navigation could be improved, as well as the rewards for doing tasks, because I don't feel too motivated to do the tasks still;1
The auto populated list of dailies was never-ending and repetitive. Who needs to floss 30 times a day? I died because i didn't take the time to delete each one individually. Honestly when i scrolled down to try to find the end i couldn't find it and felt i was making no progress in deleting the duplicates.;1
So far I like it, however there are so many items on the lists when you first download it that it gave me anxiety. You can only delete them 1 at a time and it wants confirmation before deleting each one. If the developers see this I suggest only a few items on each list to give as an example instead of the 200+ I found on my lists that all repeated. Although the check here for downloading the app gave a lot of XP.;1
This is one of the best apps for self improvement available for gamers. The idea, the execution, the design, amazing. My only gripe is that the error messages you get only sorta explain what went wrong and I have not successfully used the stat correction page once. Always error messages. Hopefully these bugs get worked out.;1
It's cute, but the fact that I cannot view a calendar with my progress kills it for me. I am going to stick to Loop app.;1
Such a thoughtful self-help app. Life saving for ADHD. THANK YOU for the wheelchair option in the icon... the diversity was such a nice surprise. I do wish there were different task layouts to choose from for the front page -- I'm just easily confused I guess! Thank you staff.;1
Love this app and use it daily! Great for task managing and motivation if you like games and collecting things! :) There are a couple of bugs though, and the app does not support some of the features available in the web version which i find a bit odd. The phone is the best place to keep a to-do list as it's always with you so i dont understand why the app isn't a priority. Im also missing an option to search or filter my inventory. Other than that i really like it.;1
Great app so far, still not sure about how everyting works...please can you create some warrior monk feature? (like shaolin rope, ecc.) Good job anyway!;1
It's a good app.;1
It really is worth it to download this app. Thank you for designing this wonderful app! Thanks so much;1
It was amazing! I just didn't have the time to set it up all the way.;1
Habitica is the best productivity app I've used thus far. It lasted me for months. The quests are the most motivating feature, and I was able to take down a couple bosses solo. However, motivation dried up weeks into my first fetch quest because despite being extremely productive, I had no chance of finding even one shard. Unless you're comfortable teaming up with a bunch of strangers to take on quests, there becomes a point when being solo makes the quest motivation feature impossible.;1
Great concept! Has me waking up on schedule and doing my tasks so I dont loose life and earn exp! Just one thing. I cant do quests. I got the dust bunnies quest but I have no clue what to do with it. Help?;1
This app is awesome could use better graphics but overall the idea of it is legit af;1
Great app! I would like more progression content. Resetting levels is easy implementation, but gets stale quickly. Mages do too much damage. But this app had been transformative and amazing. I will consider contributing to development.;1
This is wonderful but I really need to be able to use it offline as well;1
I couldn't change the language of this software, I tried it again and again, but the language didn't change.;1
Great app and service! The user base is amazing and the staff is awesome. No notification when a challenge ends and no way to automatically remove its associated tasks. Can't read the full text of challenge tasks before joining. The health/experience widget doesn't display any information.;1
I love this game. It has helped me do much It's a bit of a learning curve. It would be nice if challenges were visible from the app in all of the guilds, and I would also like to see the last day and time that a habit was marked, because the colors don't always change and if you have a lot of habits it gets confusing. Otherwise, this app is brilliantly done and will be getting my monetary support in whatever way I can afford.;1
Good;1
Pretty cool, but it needs a diary that keeps full logs of your activities and performance. It's pro reliable but it's important to know sometimes the service goes down and doesn't work. It's pretty rare though.;1
lol i went to settings, change character value, and got myself 9M coins uwu btw is that cheating...? I mean well its right there;1
It worked fine for a while, but now every time I click on a task/habit/goal to edit, the app crashes. I can tick off the task and plus on the habit just fine, but I can't edit anything now... Please look into fixing it soon? Edit: thank you, the latest update fixed it all!;1
Great for ADHD;1
I've tried quite a few rpg-like to-do list apps and I must say this one is the only one that I find genuinely enjoyable, and actually kinda feels like a game. You can tell a lot of effort was put into the aesthetic, everything is very easy to access and is pleasing to the eye. Although I think there should be a way to uncheck to-do's. I keep accidentally clicking on them in the widget and remaking them every time is starting to get annoying.;1
Could be better if it was completely free.;1
So far so good, you have to be willing to set on the app for a bit to figure it out. It's a rpg game based off of truth. The app does freeze fairly frequently but you just have to close it and reopen it and everything is back in order.;1
I like this app, and it's really helped, but now I can't open it anymore. It crashes while loading, every time. I've tried troubleshooting, restarting, deleting the cache, but nothing seems to work.;1
Thank you. I love the app and it's helping me immensely already. The only suggestion I can think of is, I wish there was a way of keeping track of my previously completed tasks so I could look back on the progress I've made. It would feel much more meaningful that way and serve as additional motivation.;1
There are some things i feel need to be ironed out e.g. i found feeding the pets/mounts a bit buggy, but overall it has definitely helped me think more about my personal goals and how to approach them;1
It has been an effective motivator and tracker for me to accomplish the smaller tasks that get me closer towards my bigger goals. But there seems to be a Bug - I can't seem to receive a friend's Party invite, though I am able to create my own party and invite friends to it. It's a one way street in my app! Joining guilds and the self-care, self-sabotage info have been most educational and helpful.;1
The ios app is lot better than this. please improve it as soon as possible.;1
Best app for daily Routine but there are some issue such as you can get lot of coins and increase your level to infinit though settings. You should improve that because Some one donot get motivated for doing task when you knew that you can change your level.;1
I like the app a lot, but some features are a little annoying. I have a few suggestions. - More ways to tweak what the widgets look like (currently they take up a lot of space). - It would be nice to see the completed tasks together with active tasks instead of them disappearing. - Task subcategories! Please! 💚 - Biggest gripe: because of the way the entire list item is like a button, I keep accidentally checking tasks that weren't actually done. +Bugged unchecking. Pls fix. Thanks💚💚💚;1
I just want to say that the tutorial was too much info, things like this should be explained in a short and concise way, at a good pace. It was just too long and too much to take in. I didn't even try the app though, I can't say what rating it deserves. I am unnistalling but I may come back to it in the future, it's not you, it's me. (Also, you can't delete your account on mobile but you can on desktop. I suggest people to try the desktop version since it may have more features);1
It's been a good way to get things done, and the concept of an RPG is very well executed. The reason for 4 out of 5 is simply regarding the interface. My wife uses it on iOS and it is light-years beyond what we have on Android. Much cleaner, more useful information, and less clunkiness.;1
This app is an awesome (and fun) to-do list! I like it a lot and it helps me out with my life and tasks every day. However, the app crashes whenever I try to sort to-dos by scheduled and it's getting a bit frustrating.;1
Pretty good app that helps me stay organized. Could use a few improvements but overall I enjoy it;1
Habitica is awesome! Only thing that it's hard to feed your pets with the app.;1
couldn't create my avatar at first, but after that it worked fine.;1
Love habitica. I find the app often has one bug or another from update to update, so can't really give 5 stars, but the devs do a smashing job regardless so 4 stars from me.;1
Great idea and I'm enjoying it so far. Chores and errands are much more fun. My one gripe so far is that it seems like most items/quests cost gems, which are pay to play. I'm afraid i'll pretty quickly run out of free items/quests to strive for and then the app will lose its effectiveness. It'd be helpful if their were other ways to unlock gems outside of paying for them, like reaching extra high levels of productivity/habit building, etc.;1
So far it's pretty good. I've been using it about a week. Sometimes it doesn't refresh, but the other users on the app seem positive and friendly. There is a lot that I am learning through users that isn't actually explained in the app. Like if you don't do all your daily tasks, the whole party takes damage. So yeah, no pressure! It would be nice for a better help options or a more detailed in-app-fist-time training/learning session. Every 'first' should option for more info!;1
Really nice app that is easy to use. Would be cool to see a feature where you can build things, like building a village and materials for this are acquired through completing tasks/habits;1
The app's a bit glitch-y, not gonna lie, but it helps tremendously in my day-to-day life. The community aspect of it is amazing, I actually feel motivated by all the kind words. Good job, developers, my life's a bit less bleak now! c:;1
Its pretty good so far. My dailies just seem to never reset though. I got a streak of 2 and from then on it never moved forward;1
This app is good and it's useful. Yes it's true that it has a few bugs here and there but the app itself is good and I like it. I wish it had an offline mode because I can't stay on all the time but I can see why we need to be online at all times.;1
This app has really helped me get my stuff in order! It also has an active community and good challenges! It is a bit glitchy at times (things don't refresh, etc) but overall it's great! Edit: lol, the 'report a bug' is glitched on my phone :P I had to manually send my info over, in the middle of fixing a glitch where my day won't reset - been broken for a week.;1
Not very expressive frame for activity descriptions, must be in the first stages of development. Guilds look incredible diverse, very surprising it is a social app. Seems the leveling function is standard gaming and well embedded. Hope open sourcing it make it better fit. Passing habits to to-do would be desirable.;1
I'm easily motivated by things like points and streaks, so this app works really well for me to increase my productivity and decrease my anxiety. I use rewards for breaks, and find that I get unpleasant but short tasks done much more often, because I can earn breaks quickly by just getting them over with. I also get my long, complicated, multi-part projects done early. I gave it four stars because there are a couple of features I'd like to see, but it works great as is.;1
I'm surprised, this app actually works for me! It helped me procrastinate less, but I also realised it works only if I remind myself to check the app a lot. I recommend it for those who have really bad procrastination problems like myself. Even if the game style of this app isn't your thing, it's a great to-do-list app for habits, daily reminders and general to-do items. Only complaint is it's glitchy for me when I want to customise my avatar.;1
I'm thoroughly enjoying this app so far. I've been a lot more productive and on point with my tasks as well as keeping up with my personal studies and hobbies. The game aspect has been great for me to hold accountability of my actions while finding joy in completing self-made goals and gaining experience and items.;1
I've been using this as a motivation and self-rewarding To-Do list. It works, and there a lot of communities of people here! Ranging from LGBT to mental illness, it's great.;1
"The game aspect is fun, and can provide a little added motivation, but beyond that it's one of the best free to-do apps I've found. The organization is easy, and the breakdown of habits, daily (or other schedule) tasks on repeat, and a one time to-do list give much more depth than apps that claim to be more ""professional."" If you like the game-ify idea this app is great. If you want a solid, free task manager, ignore the cute icons and go with this one as well.";1
Took me awhile to figure it out, the mechanics are interesting, the design is fun. It helps me build and quit some habits that i have been trying to.;1
Love the app so far. Great for motivation, but non-punishing, cute graphics, and lots of stuff to explore. Splitting up tasks by priority/type is awesome. It really has made everyday life feel more guided and fun! Would highly recommend for people who enjoy collecting, gaming, or seeing your progress add up. *One note is that sometimes, lists of tasks disappear/show tasks already completed. Closing and reopening fixes it, but would appreciate it if this bug was addressed.;1
"What an adorable and inspirational app! I have actually done things I was considering putting off because I didn't want to lose too much life and thus important items I really need/like. I've even gotten my partner to download it! It also doesn't penalize you too harshly for ""falling off the wagon,"" so to speak, and not using it for some time. As in, days to YEARS. It's the perfect combination of motivational and understanding, which is the perfect recipe for success, at least for myself. 🤓";1
The BEST app for motivation and tracking! Even putting the game aspect aside, I have never seen a more user-friendly app for habit/task tracking. I love how there are different categories for habits, tasks, and daily to-dos. It's customizable. Getting coins is motivation! Ive recommended it to everyone! Only thing I wish it had: a way to see your stats based on your missed to dos or frequency of habits. For instance: most health lost due to *blank* etc.;1
It just might be one of the best apps ever made. It has helped so much with my productivity and has such wonderful features. I love it!;1
Amazing, creative and motivating. Kudos Designers love the Gameboy pixellated feel really made me nostalgic. Amazing app;1
I have used this tool continuously since 2015 and it's a fun way to get yourself to do tasks that otherwise you might not be motivated to do. I've been a subscriber for almost two years. I would highly recommend Habitica, whether you prefer to do it all on your own, quest with others, take up challenges, or just keep track of your flossing. There's a lot to out and I've never gotten bored in almost five years.;1
I didn't think this would work, but it really does help to build habits. The interface is pretty simple and easy to understand. The complexity grows over time. I'd really like a way to share to-dos with a group. Reward those for taking the initiative to take some of the teams shared tasks.;1
Loving the app so far and has helped me stay on track with some chores and. My v small complaint is that the date is expressed wrong (for 90% of the world) as mm/dd/yy, wish I could change to dd/mm/yy, any way to change that setting on the horizon?;1
Habitica is a lot of fun to use. It helps me more to be productive by applying RPG concept into my everyday tasks. The quests and collectibles are also fun to do - it is so rewarding.;1
Awesome app. Helps me keep track of my daily tasks and routine. I like the fun reward and punishment system in the form of an rpg game. Keep up the good work!;1
Excellent app, they greatly improved the quality since last time I used it. I'm a user of the web page for 5 year now, and the app was a little outdated but know it is very complete and useful. Thank you!;1
Amazing app.. One request from the developers.. This app is turning humans into better humans so 'the rouge' class should be renamed to 'the Ninja' or something as it affects the subconscious brain of users without even them noticing it..(this pure psychology) And this is how low of attraction works.. Never talk or think of things which you don't want in life.. You yourself would not want anyone to be Rouge. So please give 'ROUGE' SOME positive polish.. If you can. Only a humble suggestion.;1
It sounds crazy but this app has basically changed my life. I'm more productive every day as this game motivates me to get my life together. I like how I can give myself credit even for the little things, the house chores no one will pay you to do or thank you for but that still need to be done. It can also be very social if you want it to be.;1
One of the best habit organisation apps and it gamifies on top, the only feature that I would really need is managing dailies in groups, like meals in group.....etc.;1
Very good app to help keep and develope new habits! Best gamification of tasks, habits and to do lists!;1
Really helps me to keep things organized and is a great way to keep myself on track!;1
It's been a week since I started using this, and I so already love this! Thanks!;1
Awesome app. Great for staying productive and getting things done. I have one suggestion for the developers though, in the party chat, when people cast skills for the party, it tends to block up the chat and interrupt conversation. It would be nice to have a different section where it shows when party members use their skills. This also leads to chats being deleted faster. Anyway, just a suggestion. I appreciate the app and it being free. It has been good for me. Thank you for your time.;1
Excellent for daily tasks and scheduling future ones;1
Life changing app. If you have any affinity to video games and want to better your life you're in the right place. This app saved me.;1
I love Habitica! I've used it for several years, both the browser version and the app. I love how simple it is and I love the social aspect! I've been able to make friends and find support through guilds, and my party really pushes each other to be our best and continually improve! This app has helped me focus on self care and get better grades in school. I'm building healthy habits and having fun with the creative quests and interactions! Habitica is amazing!;1
I just got the app and it is truly and honestly great! I'm super disorganised but this has really allowed me to consolidate all of my tasks. An incredibly smart, entertaining yet useful, and engaging app. I truly can't oversell it and now I really wanna stop writing this review to go level up my character. I want a staff!!!!;1
The RPG elements in this app are way more in depth than I was expecting. I enjoy video games a lot and Habatica has made habit building much more enjoyable for me! I also really like the social aspect of being able to encourage/be encouraged by other players. App takes some getting used to, but there's a very good tutorial section that explains the system well. The devs are also very responsive to bugs and complaints. You can tell by reading through the 1 star reviews and seeing devs responding.;1
This app has helped me make my days more productive, and I like the way it's put together. Two suggestions for the devs: 1. Introduce an option to stay indefinitely at one level, only needing that fixed amount of xp to refill your hp. With the ever increasing xp requirement, eventually I won't be able to keep levelling up and will start dying, and that'll be demotivating. 2. Make a holiday mode that has a different set of dailies/habits. I'd like to have different goals on holiday.;1
I really love this app! It helps me stay on track, and do what I need to do. It prompts you to do your tasks, because you earn points and level up when you do them. It has different sections for tasks (habits, to-dos, and dailies). You can set reminders, choose the difficulty of the task, set a due date/frequency, and so on. It also has other fun activities, and it is easy to use. I would really recommend if you procrastinate a lot like me or are just looking for a fun way to get things done! :);1
With your friends you can play this game. You progress by completing tasks you set for yourself. Often i see t the app and think, well, 10 pushups isn't that hard, might as well do it. Without the app i wouldn't have thought that. Set small tangible goals. It motivates me to do the things i want to do but can't get in the habit of doing.;1
I've been using this for about a year and a half and it has helped me hold my life together. It really does help you build habits, you just have to find out what works for you and sometimes switch things up a bit, because there are many ways of going about it. Challenges are very helpful, guilds are a great place to find like-minded people with similar goals and interests, quests done in parties are motivating, and drops like pets and gear are fun. And most importantly, it's doable!;1
Changed my life. The group feature, when you have a family, is a must have. Seeing our avatars morph and change while we level up our life, priceless. This app is worth it, it's one of the best decisions I've made for me and my children. They're excited to do chores, and I no longer procrastinate. I just can't recommend this app enough.;1
Love this app. If you need help sticking to a schedule, meeting goals, or want to better your life in any way this app is for you. Guilds and challenges promote productivity. Separate categories for habits (positive/negative), daily tasks, and to-dos keep the app structured. Wish there were more items and rpg aspects after reaching a certain level though.;1
Really good recommend to anyone who wants to get their life together. Be diligent and strict with it and you'll see significant changes long term, and the fact that it rewards you for your achievements gives you that dopamine hit you need to keep going. You can even make your own rewards with things like an hour of TV or social media or whatever as long as you achieve enough tasks and the app accommodates that. 10/10 really good for turning your life around.;1
I love this app. It's amazing and has made me a bit more productive with the few days I've had it. I just wish there was some sort of game that comes with it. I know it isn't the point of the app, but I feel like if some sort of game was added, there would be more incentive to do all your tasks. I know it's probably just me who has this issue, but a game really would add a lot to the app (even a tiny one).;1
Super fun way to keep up with tasks;1
Fantastic app.... I have tried many other productivity app and used to find it difficult to follow them every day. After I switched to this app.. it became all fun and I am getting motivated to complete the tasks as I earn rewards Suggestion to developer: I use browser version more than mobile app. please add reminder feature to browser version as well. Also please add auto date parser while adding the task. It will save a lot of time in entering the task. You ca take reference from ticktick app;1
Getting into it, following the mechanics and I feel motivated to do ans comolete stuff to earn Exp. I haven't used it much but I'm satisfied already. One small thing I can't choose to wear no glasses and I believe this is an unintentional error.;1
My favourite productivity and habit tracker app, even though I don't use too many features it can provide. It's attractive, and it feels like more fun, but I like to keep it simple. Together with my (paper) Productivity Planner I am unstoppable!;1
I'm in love with the app. It motivates me a lot and really helps to stay on track. Apart from the cool gamified features, it also has a huge and very friendly community, where you can get support and answers to pretty much any questions.;1
The app has improved over the time I've been using it. There are a few things that would be useful to have. For example, the ability to search for challenges like in the website. On another point, this app has really helped me improve in different areas of my life.;1
10 out 10 recommend for anyone who wants to stay organized and goal oriented without knowing you're doing it! This app is For beginners looking for a concept to start planing or motivating & go getters who want a fun and resourceful way to sort your goals and stay motivated.;1
Hello! Really a great app. Please make offline version too for checking tasks. Everyone should try this app. For those who have to leave bad habits, completing all the daily things, and handling big projects or completing a huge work. You can reward yourself!;1
I'm really enjoying the fun parts about this game and hope that it continues to grow. Downside is the glasses and headband can't come off the avatar. So my character is stuck with them for awhile.;1
I love it! One thing I had a problem with earlier was that if I didn't have internet connection, it wasn't possible to log my dailies in. Now I have unlimited data, so this isn't a problem for me anymore, but might be worth solving this for other players. Everything else is just wonderful and a big help to life organization for scattered-mind people like myself 😅;1
"I really like this app, it pleasing on the eyes it's well-designed, has a lot of social features but remains simple so you can focus on your goals not running the app. I would suggest to add an ability for ""gold"" that is currency only valuable to you so that your personal rewards, aka don't work against playing with your avatar and currency of that kind should be able to be exchanged within party. That way you and your friends can gift each other screen time or whatever.";1
It's a delightful app that helps you keep on top of things. Personally, I've found that you get as much as you put into it. There are communities and challenges you can join with like-minded people to help you achieve similar goals, and their are seasonal events as well. There are no adds, no constant pop ups to buy gems, and all features are equally helpful without the gems.;1
I love this app so much! They make it really fun for free players too, so you don't feel left out if you don't spend money. I have decided to get a subscription though since it's such a great app. It has my whole family super motivated, my kids are actually loving doing chores! And I also love all the social aspects to it as well. It would be cool of you could assign names for your pets, and the app doesn't function quite the same as the website version, but overall I have no complaints. :);1
Started using habitica on January 1st of this year, as a new year's resolution to manage my time and habits better, and it's been a huge help. Especially love the party aspect, and the way it adds social accountability to missing or hitting targets. Very pleased, thank you for all the work that went into this app.;1
Amazing. Love it. I can keep track of my daily and to do tasks and reward myself by seeing my character grow and level up and I can buy him new things with the coins I earn from doing tasks. The only bad things is that the game relies on honesty. There's nothing stopping you making many tasks and just ticking them off to the get Gold rewards.;1
I absolutely ADORE Habitica! It's changed my life - it's the perfect goal setting app! It keeps me motivated without making me feel overwhelmed. It's the perfect amount of detail and convenience without getting too complicated. Would LOVE to see a children's chore app from the same people - I've tried 3 and none of them even come close to being as helpful as Habitica is for me. Thanks guys!;1
It's an amazing app which makes you stick to your routine. I will surely recommend this to friends and family. I would like you to add some more feature like a timer (Pomodaro Technique) and please provide a option for adding attachments to the tasks. Also if possible instead of notifications reminder alarms are better. I f you could add them I would be highly grateful... Thanks for such an amazing time management App. 😄👍;1
Great app for encouraging you to do things! Love that you can personalise your own tasks and play with friends. Would love to see the ability to repeat tasks on weekdays/weekends, instead of just daily/weekly. And an Undo button would be awesome! Sometimes I'll mark something by accident and can't revert what hearts I lost, coins I earned, etc.;1
This is such a fun way for chores to be rewarded. My household is full of gamers, and this is a great way to create and maintain habits, as well as track chores on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. They are great about getting back to users. They have real conversations, and listen to user feedback.;1
I love this app. It keeps me on track and I have fun while doing it. Whatever aspect of you daily life you want to improve, you can set tasks and goals to help you achieve it.! 💯🙋🌄;1
WOW I REALLY LOVE THIS APP!!! Such a great idea. I first downloaded it for my youngest daughter to try help her with responsibility & organization, we connect daily on the app to check each other's progress. I generally enjoy this game, it is the only one have on my phone.;1
This is a superb way to motivate yourself to do things. To create new and healthy/fun habits and get rid of bad habits. Do you want to live a life full of adventures? Be creative and install this amazing app. I would suggest a clearer and friendlier GUI but overall itS AMAZING.;1
This app has helped me a lot and is all in all one of the best apps I know. There's just one suggestion: I have many habits and dailies hence I have to scroll a lot. It would be amazing if there was an option to change the layout so you can have a better overview.;1
Adore this app! It helps me stay on course and have fun too! Ive been trying to cut down on phone time so this makes a game out of my regular life so this game is perfect!;1
I love the interface, the overall concept and easiness of interface. Rewarding and fun to use, has helped me alot with my life goals!;1
Ive used this app a couple times now, only uninstalling because school ended, but this app is amazing when it comes down to it. It encourages people to do the stuff that they need to without the complication of being told off by others. Plus, it has a cool rpg theme thats great for anybody who has grown up with/rpg game like elements.;1
Is the best app for organisation time! Everything is clearly and look like the game! You have yours avatar and you can buy new challenges and can take in lots of event. I love this app! This is the best application what I see. Now all my day is easier and I learned plan my life/day;1
Can't describe how much this app helped me.I couldn't keep a habit at all,but with this app I reached a point where now I can have multiple habits.I love it so much.It's helping me everyday,every year.Wish all the best for the developers.This app has everything you want and it's beautiful+helpful.If you are looking for a habit/task app then this app is for you.Just download it already.It will help you.♥★;1
Fantastic absolutely best of it's kind. No ads, great system of to dos dailies and habits (that you want to have and break) plus the tavern/guild/challenge/quest/party system really keeps you motivated, as does the in art or out of world reward system. Absolutely fantastic.;1
I love this app. It's helped me so much. There's only a few things that bother me about it, like how you can't change the order of dailies but besides that it's fantastic.;1
It's a good app. It fuses the entertainment received in playing games with finishing chores, which is pretty hard to pull off. I'll recommend it to anybody who's trying a lot to change their life but easily succumbs to their desires.;1
There are options to give your avatar a wheelchair, and there are a lot of colors to choose from, as well as a skinnier body type or a larger one... I don't use a wheelchair, but I just loved this option so much because I have friends who do and it really means a lot to them! So cute lol;1
Really well developed system which is fun/easy to use. Since the good functions aren't blocked by premium necessities it makes this app a well worth download. Adding a schedule would however benifit as it would allow the users to keep everything on the app itself.;1
This app has helped me keep up so many habits and routines. At first I struggled with it a lot, but I soon joined a party. The quests are really helpful to keep me on track, and there are others in the groups to help out too.;1
This is an awesome app idea for really anyone to use. Just a great app;1
I haven't been using Habitica for that long but I've already fallen in love with it! It's really helpful if you want to keep your life organised. Amazing 👌;1
So far, I love this app and the idea behind it. It holds me accountable for my tasks and habits which i really love. I would totally give it a shot.;1
I soooo love this app. I am not a gamer but gamifying my habits makes it more interactive. You wouldn't want your avatar to die so you'll do your tasks.;1
It is awesome super helped me But I have a suggestion you can improve your chat session and to invite members to party you can make so we can explore users and invite them;1
How to See my completed tasks ? I am confused as I accidentally clicked on done and tasks stopped appearing on the list Obviously. But It creates problem cuz you didn't do but it checked. So please add feature so we can see all our completed tasks upto a month . So we can see our records and edit any possible mistakes. Thank you. Other than this small part This app is best for me. I am requesting you if you can listen us please please add this feature. 🙏🙏🙏 COMPLETED TASKS LIST UPTO A MONTH;1
This helps me deal with my procrastinating issues and has helped me a lot more than I thought it would. If anyone struggles with being productive, this app will help you manage your tasks efficiently! It's an amazing app!💜;1
Both useful and fun. I was surprised by how helpful it could be. You can also learn new things from the challenges and guilds.;1
By far my favorite To-Do and habit tracker app. The game and in-game incentives really help and make it fun! Highly recommend this app!;1
I love Habitica! I am particularly bad at getting things done and this app has helped me improve so much. It's as it says, gamifying your tasks. I am on level 12 and I have only been doing it for a week! If you need a pick me up with your chores and Todo lists then check it out.;1
OK, I love the app, it's great, but the notifications just doesn't work, they are broken, and it's the main feature I'm looking for, fix it in order to give you the five starts;1
Favorite app to-date, engaging, intuitive, most importantly fun. Something I havne't had a lot of these past few years. A++ my kudos to the developers. Happily support this app, I highly recommend it. 👍;1
Most unique app I've ever used. So far so good. Fun. Makes me want to earn coins by completing goals and tasks so I can buy some fancy stuff or a pet.;1
I love Habitica. It works to make the things I have to do at least somewhat rewarding and I can set fun goals for boring tasks.;1
Very creative. and a good idea too!;1
Been using Habitica for a few months. Tried a few other to-do list games, none of them beats Habitica. Best way to keep track of daily life and still have fun.;1
Great app, would be nice to be able to check the checklist items in todos.;1
Loving the app so far! Just a minor note: I can't seem to unequip my avatar's glasses or headband...;1
A great app to keep you up and moving, especially being in quarantine :) (this review was made at the time of covid 19);1
Engaging and effective. It doesn't seem to be possible to use a Google Play balance to pay for gems, though.;1
Very useful and helps to keep organized. Gameify you're life! Plus you can find like minded people and join challenges, parties, and guilds. 5 Stars!;1
The best app to become a better person and acheive your daily goals developing great habits! The whole community is cheerful and i may thank you for taking the time to develope such great considerate features for free, you've really helped us all 💖💖;1
Great way to keep track of things to do on the computer and phone;1
I've only been on the app for a small time and I can already see the ways in which it can help. Very inclusive and helpful;1
I love this app, I just wish it wasn't so easy to change your stats and I wish we could delete the default daily tasks. Maybe I can but I'm a dumbass. Idk;1
Love this game. Sometimes have trouble connecting to the server though.;1
Great! It's a great game to motivate people to do big stuff who just keep sitting on the sofa and don't want to move.thank you creaters of habitica.😋😁;1
10/10. Subscription is not necessary at all, what it offers is purely cosmetic.;1
has motivated me, kept me productive, and is continuing to do so for more than a year now! used this app for two full school years, tried others, but nothing really compares to habitica! this app is awesome and super fun! makes work more satsifying to complete and the party system is very helpful as well :);1
Very nice app. Let´s you make reminders and actually feel rewarded once you do it.;1
I really like so far. I makes my daily routine a bit fun and make it meant something in a way.;1
Its awesome;1
"Helps me SO much. Like seriously, commit to this, get into a ""party"" (kind of an online group for this rpg), and it may help you like it's helped me! I am really lazy so the progress I'm making is miraculous. It really kind of.. forces you to do what you need to do and it's my favorite mobile game there is. Hats off to the developers and anyone else involved!";1
Amazing, creative and motivating. Kudos Designers love the Gameboy pixellated feel really made me nostalgic. Amazing app;1
This app is very nice, it did help me;1
Took me awhile to figure it out, the mechanics are interesting, the design is fun. It helps me build and quit some habits that i have been trying to.;1
Fun;1
I've been using this as a motivation and self-rewarding To-Do list. It works, and there a lot of communities of people here! Ranging from LGBT to mental illness, it's great.;1
It just might be one of the best apps ever made. It has helped so much with my productivity and has such wonderful features. I love it!;1
I will reinstall this app;1
The app is really smart;1
Helps me turn my crippling depression into regular depression.;1
Thanks for free widget;1
I'm thoroughly enjoying this app so far. I've been a lot more productive and on point with my tasks as well as keeping up with my personal studies and hobbies. The game aspect has been great for me to hold accountability of my actions while finding joy in completing self-made goals and gaining experience and items.;1
Super fun way to keep up with tasks;1
It was amazing;1
Great. I would recommend the following features: - Skills. When you work on a task, you could select which skills you will be working on. - A timer: keep track of how long you spent working on a task, and consequently on the skills. This would allow a summary of how long the player spent on each skill. - (maybe?) Skill trees. Being able to create publix skill trees for a project/hobby/etc... would be a very nice feature too.;1
Very good app to help keep and develope new habits! Best gamification of tasks, habits and to do lists!;1
It's hard to not get bored when I being serious on something. So, I always think that life is a game. And this is a great app that can help me to get rid from my boredom when I build my good habits. Thank you very much for the developer. 5 stars from me. 😊🤩;1
Love the app so far. Great for motivation, but non-punishing, cute graphics, and lots of stuff to explore. Splitting up tasks by priority/type is awesome. It really has made everyday life feel more guided and fun! Would highly recommend for people who enjoy collecting, gaming, or seeing your progress add up. *One note is that sometimes, lists of tasks disappear/show tasks already completed. Closing and reopening fixes it, but would appreciate it if this bug was addressed.;1
Best productivity app;1
"The game aspect is fun, and can provide a little added motivation, but beyond that it's one of the best free to-do apps I've found. The organization is easy, and the breakdown of habits, daily (or other schedule) tasks on repeat, and a one time to-do list give much more depth than apps that claim to be more ""professional."" If you like the game-ify idea this app is great. If you want a solid, free task manager, ignore the cute icons and go with this one as well.";1
Very creative. and a good idea too!;1
Very usefull and fun;1
La actualicé hoy (22/07/2020) y se detiene cada vez que intento ver o darle de comer a mis mascotas. Por favor soluciónenlo 🙇;1
I'm here for the Ninja Cerebral;1
Loving the app so far and has helped me stay on track with some chores and. My v small complaint is that the date is expressed wrong (for 90% of the world) as mm/dd/yy, wish I could change to dd/mm/yy, any way to change that setting on the horizon?;1
The BEST app for motivation and tracking! Even putting the game aspect aside, I have never seen a more user-friendly app for habit/task tracking. I love how there are different categories for habits, tasks, and daily to-dos. It's customizable. Getting coins is motivation! Ive recommended it to everyone! Only thing I wish it had: a way to see your stats based on your missed to dos or frequency of habits. For instance: most health lost due to *blank* etc.;1
It's been a week since I started using this, and I so already love this! Thanks!;1
Habitica is a lot of fun to use. It helps me more to be productive by applying RPG concept into my everyday tasks. The quests and collectibles are also fun to do - it is so rewarding.;1
Habitica had helped me a lot in my efforts to improve my life. I've been using Habitica for 2 years now, and it really provide me with the motivation & support needed for me to achieve my objectives.;1
This is an awesome app idea for really anyone to use. Just a great app;1
Awesome app. Helps me keep track of my daily tasks and routine. I like the fun reward and punishment system in the form of an rpg game. Keep up the good work!;1
Great way to keep track of things to do on the computer and phone;1
I didn't think this would work, but it really does help to build habits. The interface is pretty simple and easy to understand. The complexity grows over time. I'd really like a way to share to-dos with a group. Reward those for taking the initiative to take some of the teams shared tasks.;1
Super great!!;1
I seriously like it;1
Thank you this made a difference;1
One of the best habit organisation apps and it gamifies on top, the only feature that I would really need is managing dailies in groups, like meals in group.....etc.;1
"What an adorable and inspirational app! I have actually done things I was considering putting off because I didn't want to lose too much life and thus important items I really need/like. I've even gotten my partner to download it! It also doesn't penalize you too harshly for ""falling off the wagon,"" so to speak, and not using it for some time. As in, days to YEARS. It's the perfect combination of motivational and understanding, which is the perfect recipe for success, at least for myself. 🤓";1
Really helps me to keep things organized and is a great way to keep myself on track!;1
Its great but I need to make a habit to use the app.;1
Just love it;1
Does what it says, but unable to re-arrange the tasks to my liking via the app. Have to use the browser to do that.;1
Excellent for daily tasks and scheduling future ones;1
Life changing app. If you have any affinity to video games and want to better your life you're in the right place. This app saved me.;1
Excellent app, they greatly improved the quality since last time I used it. I'm a user of the web page for 5 year now, and the app was a little outdated but know it is very complete and useful. Thank you!;1
It sounds crazy but this app has basically changed my life. I'm more productive every day as this game motivates me to get my life together. I like how I can give myself credit even for the little things, the house chores no one will pay you to do or thank you for but that still need to be done. It can also be very social if you want it to be.;1
Amazing app.. One request from the developers.. This app is turning humans into better humans so 'the rouge' class should be renamed to 'the Ninja' or something as it affects the subconscious brain of users without even them noticing it..(this pure psychology) And this is how low of attraction works.. Never talk or think of things which you don't want in life.. You yourself would not want anyone to be Rouge. So please give 'ROUGE' SOME positive polish.. If you can. Only a humble suggestion.;1
I have used this tool continuously since 2015 and it's a fun way to get yourself to do tasks that otherwise you might not be motivated to do. I've been a subscriber for almost two years. I would highly recommend Habitica, whether you prefer to do it all on your own, quest with others, take up challenges, or just keep track of your flossing. There's a lot to out and I've never gotten bored in almost five years.;1
Awesome. It really helps me to level up my life.;1
Changed my life. The group feature, when you have a family, is a must have. Seeing our avatars morph and change while we level up our life, priceless. This app is worth it, it's one of the best decisions I've made for me and my children. They're excited to do chores, and I no longer procrastinate. I just can't recommend this app enough.;1
A good app. Love the concept. Helped me;1
This is the first time I found an app which can read my mind. This app really knows the scientific importance of reward. I really advice anyone to install this app and give it a try especially if you are a student.;1
Hello! Really a great app. Please make offline version too for checking tasks. Everyone should try this app. For those who have to leave bad habits, completing all the daily things, and handling big projects or completing a huge work. You can reward yourself!;1
It is awesome super helped me But I have a suggestion you can improve your chat session and to invite members to party you can make so we can explore users and invite them;1
I've never enjoyed accountability before this... Our whole family partied up and is having a blast PLAYING to do chores. Wonderful concept!;1
I'm really enjoying the fun parts about this game and hope that it continues to grow. Downside is the glasses and headband can't come off the avatar. So my character is stuck with them for awhile.;1
Super helpful for habits and breaking bad ones;1
"What an absolute boon. My boyfriend has ADHD and a love for video games--this app helps him remember and complete tasks much more easily than unengaging notes-app checklists. It really does wonders for motivation. Habitica is helping me survive grad school AND manage the mental load of day to day activities. I'm really excited for the new ""groups"" feature to be rolled out as well. Thank you so much Habitica!";1
Loving the app so far! Just a minor note: I can't seem to unequip my avatar's glasses or headband...;1
Awesome;1
This is great! After having played it for three days I was begging my mom for chores to do!;1
Getting into it, following the mechanics and I feel motivated to do ans comolete stuff to earn Exp. I haven't used it much but I'm satisfied already. One small thing I can't choose to wear no glasses and I believe this is an unintentional error.;1
10 out 10 recommend for anyone who wants to stay organized and goal oriented without knowing you're doing it! This app is For beginners looking for a concept to start planing or motivating & go getters who want a fun and resourceful way to sort your goals and stay motivated.;1
I love Habitica! I've used it for several years, both the browser version and the app. I love how simple it is and I love the social aspect! I've been able to make friends and find support through guilds, and my party really pushes each other to be our best and continually improve! This app has helped me focus on self care and get better grades in school. I'm building healthy habits and having fun with the creative quests and interactions! Habitica is amazing!;1
Has really helped me get more done and stay on task!;1
The best out there.;1
I love Habitica. It works to make the things I have to do at least somewhat rewarding and I can set fun goals for boring tasks.;1
Great app. I don't even play video games but I love the set up of this application, the split into habits, dailies and tasks is perfect. The streaks and rewards are motivational, I like the capability to set reminders and being able to have a task list widget on my home page. I tried a couple other to do apps and none have kept me consistent besides this one.;1
Great! No errors found, super useful, fun, good design, and small (I guess?). Super recommended!;1
With your friends you can play this game. You progress by completing tasks you set for yourself. Often i see t the app and think, well, 10 pushups isn't that hard, might as well do it. Without the app i wouldn't have thought that. Set small tangible goals. It motivates me to do the things i want to do but can't get in the habit of doing.;1
Fantastic app.... I have tried many other productivity app and used to find it difficult to follow them every day. After I switched to this app.. it became all fun and I am getting motivated to complete the tasks as I earn rewards Suggestion to developer: I use browser version more than mobile app. please add reminder feature to browser version as well. Also please add auto date parser while adding the task. It will save a lot of time in entering the task. You ca take reference from ticktick app;1
I love the interface, the overall concept and easiness of interface. Rewarding and fun to use, has helped me alot with my life goals!;1
The only app that really helped getting through my really busy schedule;1
Helpful and fun;1
Love this app. If you need help sticking to a schedule, meeting goals, or want to better your life in any way this app is for you. Guilds and challenges promote productivity. Separate categories for habits (positive/negative), daily tasks, and to-dos keep the app structured. Wish there were more items and rpg aspects after reaching a certain level though.;1
I love this app. It keeps me on track and I have fun while doing it. Whatever aspect of you daily life you want to improve, you can set tasks and goals to help you achieve it.! 💯🙋🌄;1
Really helped me stay on top of online classes this year!;1
I love this app. It's helped me so much. There's only a few things that bother me about it, like how you can't change the order of dailies but besides that it's fantastic.;1
The best app for people with or without ADHD;1
This app is fantastic! It helps to organize tasks and bring new positive habits into your life. And does it in a gamified, entertaining way. You should at least try it out!;1
Thank you;1
Very nice app. Let´s you make reminders and actually feel rewarded once you do it.;1
The app has improved over the time I've been using it. There are a few things that would be useful to have. For example, the ability to search for challenges like in the website. On another point, this app has really helped me improve in different areas of my life.;1
Love love LOVE the idea behind this!;1
The best app to become a better person and acheive your daily goals developing great habits! The whole community is cheerful and i may thank you for taking the time to develope such great considerate features for free, you've really helped us all 💖💖;1
Please keep tinkering, and improving. Thank you for this app;1
I love this app. It's amazing and has made me a bit more productive with the few days I've had it. I just wish there was some sort of game that comes with it. I know it isn't the point of the app, but I feel like if some sort of game was added, there would be more incentive to do all your tasks. I know it's probably just me who has this issue, but a game really would add a lot to the app (even a tiny one).;1
App keeps crashing when launching, couldn't even get past the title screen. Edit: After signing into the website version, tried to install the app again and apparently it worked!;1
WHY? Why my habit streaks keep disappearing every single day!? :( Edit: Thank you, developers! I didn't notice that option I love this app❤️;1
So far the best productivity app, with this being productive is fun;1
I soooo love this app. I am not a gamer but gamifying my habits makes it more interactive. You wouldn't want your avatar to die so you'll do your tasks.;1
This app has helped me make my days more productive, and I like the way it's put together. Two suggestions for the devs: 1. Introduce an option to stay indefinitely at one level, only needing that fixed amount of xp to refill your hp. With the ever increasing xp requirement, eventually I won't be able to keep levelling up and will start dying, and that'll be demotivating. 2. Make a holiday mode that has a different set of dailies/habits. I'd like to have different goals on holiday.;1
I am in the unique circumstance of liking to gamify my life and also being horrible at incentivizing doing daily chores. This is literally the perfect app for me.;1
So far, I love this app and the idea behind it. It holds me accountable for my tasks and habits which i really love. I would totally give it a shot.;1
The RPG elements in this app are way more in depth than I was expecting. I enjoy video games a lot and Habatica has made habit building much more enjoyable for me! I also really like the social aspect of being able to encourage/be encouraged by other players. App takes some getting used to, but there's a very good tutorial section that explains the system well. The devs are also very responsive to bugs and complaints. You can tell by reading through the 1 star reviews and seeing devs responding.;1
Beautifully done app;1
Puts the fun into prodfuntivity!;1
Awesome app. Great for staying productive and getting things done. I have one suggestion for the developers though, in the party chat, when people cast skills for the party, it tends to block up the chat and interrupt conversation. It would be nice to have a different section where it shows when party members use their skills. This also leads to chats being deleted faster. Anyway, just a suggestion. I appreciate the app and it being free. It has been good for me. Thank you for your time.;1
Amazing app that helps me stay motivated and productive!;1
Pro user here: I have 2 issues 1. After I clear/kill the app (swipe away in the multi-task mode) the Forest app ceases to work and I can use any other app. Please fix this. (Pixel 2 user) 2. Why can't Pro-users watch an Ad to double their coins? We should have the liberty to avail this feature too. I used to double my coins (by watching 30 second ads) before I paid for the app, and now I can't do it anymore. That's not fair.;0
I have only 86 coins. But I couldn't start the count down as it has no such option. It has only and option as ' unlock it' what's that . Please fix it. It took my whole time inorder to search about that. But failed. How can I unlock with 86 coins. They don't have any alternative ways to go inside the app. It helped me in the morning but now it's making me angry;0
Only deserve big zero. Because 1) I reinstalled this app 17 times in a week. No other app crashed this much times past 1 year in my phone. Your concept is awesome.. thats is why i installed this much times. But it needs a good developer....not just like todays...NOTE : Your 4.20.1 updation failed to solve this issue..;0
The app always crash. I already sent a report both to your email and through the app (which I have re-downloaded many times) but still with no reply. I'm using the pro version. It is annoying that I have to re-download it every time I need to use it.;0
The app keeps crashing on my device everytime I need to delete it and re download it from play store. It wastes my mobile data and my time taken for redownloading it. I am a user of pro version. It's annoying that a paid version of the app keeps crashing;0
I cannot signup or log in and I cannot find any information to be able to sign up on the web of the Forest website. I really was looking forward to using this but this sucks! It keep asking me ot by the pro version! it sucks! Mostly that I Cannot really use the application!;0
I have previously used this app , it was working fine but when i installed it again , it was not working . My device also showed that the app has caused 10 errors in a week , so it should be unistalled;0
It does not work as it supposed to. I clicked the side button (button that pops up active apps), go to the home page from there, accessing other app, and the app still planting the tree even though I 'quit' the app;0
The idea is great but the app keeps crashing every 2 days! I need to uninstall and then reinstall it if I want it to work. Plus all of my progress is gone. Can't sign up either 👎;0
Suddenly it stopped working and it really disappointed me ... i was not able to take it anymore... after planting 13 trees on a single day I'm so sad that all my coin collection got lost...;0
This app is not responding after updating. I am a pro user of this app and using this from last month. But after updating it at first the app store was not opening, now the whole app stopped responding.... Pl solve this problem...;0
I still can't sign up or log in. Store is empty and it crashes when I press the premium tags in store. Connection errors(Tells me im not connected to a network). Deep Focus still lets me browse other apps.;0
Suddenly the app will stop working and I have to reinstall it again. And each time I install this app I'm loosing my data . App is excellent but this issue is horrible. I already sent mail addressing this issue but no response and same thing is repeating. I'm facing the same problem again. It's horrible. It's becoming worst it's not at all working;0
It automatically keeps stopping and because of this i lost 15 days data. I don't have data access all the time please fix it .;0
Okay ive already subscribed for pro version in another device and now in this device it is not showing how to login... It always asks to go pro version again and again.. Please help me with this situation;0
I was looking for an app, in order to stay focused and be more productive. Ads and coins don't work for me. I would say they're more distracting.;0
I downloaded this app many times but every time when i open the app it abruptly stops and I am unable to use it. I am unable to open it because it immediately shut downs as soon as open the app.;0
NOT a fan of the new permission requirements. I've never had any problem with the app detecting whether I've left it, and shouldn't have to give you access to my notifications for the app to do the same job as always. Right now it's basically just a fancy timer. EDIT AS RESPONSE: I get that, but was it really necessary to make that mandatory for anyone, even users who had no problem before? Regarding data use, the only thing I can do is take your word for it (as with any company, but still).;0
I installed this app in April and then it started crashing a lot. So I re-installed it and all my data had been lost. After that I installed it again on 9th June to give it another try and after 3 days the same thing happened again. I loved the app a lot so I bought the pro version but it still keeps crashing. All my settings, allow list, custom phrases, reminders and tags are always deleted after re-installing it THRICE . I use Samsung Galaxy S8. Fix it soon or refund me my money. Pathetic app.;0
Had to reinstall this 3 times now. I already turned off the auto update feature. I keep losing my data.;0
At first you will get motivated by seeing this app. Later after paying whenever you choose a tree it crashes down. Moreover even you use some of the other apps(not all) during growing plant, app won't find and still it grows. Lots of flaws and bugs. What is the procedure to get refund????;0
"It was cute, but on my first use of the app and 10 minutes into my first bout of focus, it started sending a relentless burst of never ending notifications to my watch, so fast that I could not cancel the notifications in my fr245 music. It just blasted vibrating ""your tree is still growing..."". It only stoped when I stoped the app on my phone. The focus app that took all of my focus. So much for a first impression.";0
After the update it is crashing most of the time I open the store.;0
After 1 week the app crashes and I have to install it again. Please fix the bug.;0
I gave this app three stars because although it helps me stay productive I am not able to login or sign in, whenever I click on the option the screen goes dull. I had uninstall the app and install it again but nothing changed. I even lost all my planting record. I am a premium user but I can't buy a tree or log in. I will only edit my review if this gets fixed. EDIT: I ended giving it one star because nothing has been done to try solve the problem. I have updated the app nothing has changed!!;0
I switched off the automatic update. The app still won't stop crashing 😑 It has been 4 times that i had to uninstall and reinstall the app. Fix it. If i knew this would happen, i wouldn't have had paid for it Update....the app has crashed 5 times now(even after switching off auto update) and somehow i am not able to buy trees now. The app closes when i try to do that😑😑😑😑😑😑 Should have invested in a better app;0
After I purchased the pro version, all my previous tress were deleted. Contacted support. They told me to log out and for the past couple of days I have been unable to log back in. Unable to view friends list, sync, tags are not working properly,redeem gifts or plant trees with friends😑 the support team is also not helping me quite well. I have been emailing them and I am not getting clear instructions 👎 I am also unable to connect the intercom within the app.;0
There's a real tiring bug telling me that deep focus feature won't work till I enable some permissions and till it's not done the timer would go on even if I switch to another app, rendering the basic function of the app completely useless! Please do atleast tell us which permissions to give or, like, take us to the permission page and let us turn on the permissions ourselves🤯, even that would work rather than this completely useless state!!! Please so necessary changes, PLEASE!;0
[1] Pls put additional sounds like instrumental music, campfire, etc. [2] an option where you can study unlimited and stop it anytime you want and still get coins [3] If the tag is changed DURING the planting process, it should reflect separately the time spent by the previous tag as well as that of the new tag so that the overall distribution is at its peak accuracy. Will put 5 stars afterwards.;0
The notification sound isn't coming with this version whether I close or keep the app open. I checked all my phone notification settings and also the app settings. All are on sound yet there is no sound alert after completion of the tree plantation. This is very inconvenient. Please rectify.;0
I'm *not* going to give an app access to read my notifications, including contact names, message content etc. I wouldn't give my phone to a stranger to read my private things even if they claimed they wouldn't do anything with the info. Nobody should. Really disappointed with the Deep Focus feature since the leader board was one thing that motivated me, and now I can't use it because of the new permissions it needs, thus all of my need for the app is gone. Sad I supported the app with money too.;0
This app is crashing again and again ....when i click on unlock time button .....while starting my session.;0
I am a pro user and I have purchased all ambient sounds but none of these sounds are working I checked all my settings and permissions.but also it's not working I like such doubly ambient sounds so please fix this up .it shows its playing but no sound will come .my speaker is working fine;0
The app is good but I'll give it one star so my review will get noticed. I will change this once the issue below is fixed. The guide for my tags distribution are all in the same color, making it useless really. How do I get this fixed? I already contacted support yet they still haven't read my message after a full day.;0
My app is not opening .... I have uninstall and then install many times but still facing the same problem;0
I bought new phone realme 6 pro, and in this app fails to open several time...then they ask to clear data to continue but after that can't login in the app. I had uninstalled several times to get it right but every day this thing happen..... please fix this. I had not encountered in my old phone (Redmi note 7);0
"There is no way to use deep focus mode which is the whole point of this app. Every time I try to turn it on it says "" please enable 'certain' phone permissions to use "" yes that's very helpful thank you.";0
Hello Developers, The tree I plant are dying without a reason. I plant them and just leave the mobile by turning off the screen. But when I turn on the screen again I see that my tress has died. Please look into the matter.;0
The app was working fine till I updated it. With the new update I could not access my store. So I decided to re - install it , and the problem pops up again . I cannot access my store and my coins are lost !;0
The background rain sound keeps automatically turning off after a few minutes of using the timer. When I open my phone again, I have to manually turn the rain back on.;0
It's a great app but now a days it clears all the data and I cant see any tree which i plant earlier.... so i reinstalled all the time.. pls fix this prblm ( nb: i dnt have premium);0
Useless.Works even after switching to another app.The deep focus mode never turns on.Im fed up.;0
Avoid. Avoid. Avoid. Even in the paid app, we are just given 2 trees, and the rest again have to be purchased. And they are not by any means inexpensive. Then there are the ads. Ads for their other apps that popup constantly. Why should I get ads when I have paid. Avoid!;0
JULY 2, 2020. Same problem. WORKS FOR THE FIRST TIME I OPEN IT, FOR THE NEXT ONES IT JUST IMMEDIATELY CLOSES ITSELF 6.20.2020 I can't open it. The app won't work. I have to reinstall it everytime I want to plant again.;0
The app crashes soo many times and i have to uninstall it and than install it again which basically reduces my all coins and that is literally horrible as i save coins to unlock my fav trees , plzzz fix this problem , Seeing forward to developers!!!!;0
There is a review below they clearly didn't read they told them to fix there problem by doing things they had already done. Also this app makes you pay for thing I had before which where given before. If course it is a business and can charge for what they want to.;0
I love this app..but after updating i cant even open the app in my phone and cant getting any new unlock tree... Please help me to use this aap;0
App keeps stopping. Was really good before but after the update it was really disappointing as it keeps stopping. I have uninstalled and reinstalled a dozen times but still shows the same result;0
Now that we need to pay to lock other app while planting the tree, this app has lost it's purpose. I'll need to switch to another app next month.;0
Crashes everytime. Isn't fixing. I had already uninstalled this app once and lost all my progress, would have to do it again since it's not opening! Disappointed.;0
After purchase of pro version I lost all of my 500+ coins.;0
"Uhhhh.... has anyone actually read the privacy policy? By accepting your allowingvthem access to your camera, audio, data usage, location, photo library, email,purchases, usernames, and they clearly state "" for third party"" in it....";0
It's silly. Now I'm looking at my phone to see it the plant is growing. The plants are unrealistic. It did not help me stay focused during my Zoom mtg. I don't get it. Uninstalling...;0
Horrible app it is. It keeps stopping over & over. Don't know what's the issue. I have already uninstalled, but still problem persists.;0
They have clearly made this app about data mining, it use to be very good but now it just wants access to unnecessary information to work properly.;0
I'm unable to put deep focus mode on ! It's not responding when I'm trying to on the deep focus mode,,,whenever I'm taping;0
i am facing some issue with the payments in app. as they mentioned to mail on given id. i did it. its been more than a week. didnt even bother to reply. disappointed;0
I have paid for the premium version still it does not behave that way. I am not able to log in . Basically it's the same as before the payment. Please help;0
I can't buy the pro version, it always said that the payment is unsuccessful, i already try to fix it but it still not working;0
After 3 days the app automatically crashed. I'm a pro version user. I like the app but the problem is horrible. Please fixed it.;0
Failed to open many times.. regretting for being subscribed user.. still problem exist..please rectify.. fed up with this app..please make sure that suggested version available.. it is only 4.18.1 available and I have to download the app for every 6 hours..worst appp;0
This app crashes around 8 times a day. I got to re-install the app every time.Have got the pro version,and repenting for it.;0
Have given all permissions yet unable to turn on deep focus mode. Plus the link that's supposed to explain permissions leads to a 404.;0
This app is not working and gets stopped again &again;0
An error occurred (error code: 600, 620) it is big problem arise when trying to unlock a tree.;0
Horrible the app crashed and I was never able to open it. I had it for weeks and whenever I opened it, it crashed .;0
App is so much good , best app , i want to give 5 star but not giving so that u can notice me . After its update ,my app is not opening il, if i reinstall it , my coins will lost and trees also . Please help me what to do;0
Why there is a compulsion to enable the notification button even though it shows a warning that the app is being able to access the personal information and other such notifications and if we won't enable it then the app doesn't even work?;0
Worst app ever thought it was good quality but no! This app really annoyed me now you have to pay to study properly;0
Sometime glitches out and doesn't count exceeded time even though I have it set to count exceeded time.;0
I want a refund. This app worked great but now it doesn't work and tech support hasn't done anything about my issues.;0
Poor update .... it calculates time wrongly N it reduced my coins from 533 to 510 for no reason .... earlier i really liked the app but now i dont;0
After the update whenever I try o buy a new kind of tree the app closes I liked the app before but now i have losed my interest in it😒😒😒😒😒 Please fix this bug..;0
It's glitching, it keeps crashing and I always have to re-install after every use...;0
First , suddenly app started crashing, when i reinstalled i couldn't log in or restore my purchase!!!!!;0
I no longer recive any notifications after planting the tree. That makes this app utterly useless. P.S. still not working after the newest update;0
I wanna give it 4 stars bcz it's just an amazing app that boosts my study hrs😃...But I have given only 1stars bcz THE APP STOPS WORKING SUDDENLY....THEN I AM NOT ABLE TO OPEN IT and I have to reinstall🙁 it then only it workss...its the only problem I faced.But this is the worst case....BCZ ALL MY PLANTS GONE AWAY.....ALL MY DATA....ALL MY COINS AND PLANTS I PURCHASED GONE AWAYYYY🙄🙄🙄🙄 I hope the app developers team will correct it soon😊.;0
Awful app. It doesn't stop me from accessing any app. Good concept, poor execution.;0
I paid the amount for pro version .but still not working.the amount has been debited .;0
I downloaded this app two times yesterday it did not install and used the data, but today yeah..it's installed.;0
IF I FOCUS IT FOR 60 MIN after completing it says i was focused for 8 min only ....😑😑 Other times r working fine BUT NOT THE 60 MIN TIMER;0
Very nice app,really useful but App keeps crashing please fix this;0
The app keeps crashing...I have to delete and reinstall it again;0
Just keeps crashing all the time.;0
I have ever seen the app which ask for watch a video to delete past record..... uninstalled Information theif.;0
Unable to turn on deep focus mode.;0
Re-installed this app but still error occured. Error code 688 . Reply ASAP;0
App keeps stopping after restarting my device😠 Fix this!;0
Okay so it's really not working for me. In the deep focus mode I can open any app no matter if the Whitelist mode is on or off. When it's on I can still access the blacklisted apps and when it's off instead of being inaccessible to ANY app it happens the other way around. Even the notifs keep coming. All this despite the app having access to permissions needed to block it. KINDLY FIX IT ASAP. If it keeps working like this it's definitely not gonna help suppress phone-addiction...;0
App crashes when i try to change music which results in whithering of my trees;0
I was enjoying the app, found I was way less distracted by my phone, until I decided to purchase the pro version to move my progress over to my new phone. During the sign up, my password manager apparently reset the signup form, including my date of birth. This set the field to the default, which locked me out of the account. I emailed support, and the only way to unlock it was too email my driver's license and social security number (?!). I just can't trust sending my SSN to a $1.99 app.;0
Not related to app, but looks like fake users. Maybe bots. How can someone put 22.8 hours of working! Means No sleep, no eating, no rest, no restroom visits??! Its impossible! Advice for App: Please make more beautiful trees and more coins as reward for consistency and/or increasing number of work hours etc. Baiscally imitate your other app Sleeptown. Keep other beautiful trees hidden and give them as reward. Trees as well as forest plot should be more appealing and beautiful.;0
Crashes consistently. I bought the premium version and while the app does serve its purpose well, it crashes way too often. I'm always forced to uninstall and reinstall it. This defeats the purpose of the app. Clearing app data and cache take it to some Chinese/SE Asian language version where I can't even login. Please fix this issue or suggest a solution.;0
Can't allow the usage of other app when you not take a premium membership.;0
Initially I liked the app very much...After that.. Some times when I try it open it's not open and keep on showing forest keeps stopping .. So I unsinstalled it and installed again.. After few days experienced same problem.. I thought if I buy proversion this will be fixed.. But evne after buying I'm again experiencing the same problem.. Very disappointed;0
Was considering purchasing pro but I don't understand why the notification sound from trees completion never happens. If I'm focusing on a task I would never know when the timer is done. I've tried multiple tweaks with the app settings (enabling notification, ringtone mode is not silent, enabling keep the screen on) and phone settings (all notifications were turned on, tried changing notification sound). My phone's volume for all ringtone, media, notification and system is not mute.;0
OMG! I have never been so irritated by an app. It worked once and then again started to crash, I reinstall it, again and again and again. Everyday i when I wanna use the app I have to reinstall it. Why develop such a nice app which is of no use. Very very disappointed!!;0
I am get rid from auto stop problem of this app in samsung phones this is not going to open on any condition;0
Suspicious app. The latest update requires soooo many permissions and access to personal sensitive data. Also previous versions worked as intended on very few days. Even the most basic features requires payment to be made. Really unhappy with the app. The purpose seems defeated. Brilliant concept but poor execution.;0
Very bad application. Rather horrible and frustrating user experience. Difficult to understand and use. I paid for the app to become pro user. Now I can't start any session because either I have too create a room with friends or I have to join a room which I don't have code for. Why do I need to add friends. None of my friends use this app. This made me stuck in the app, and not able to use it. Plus, where is my mobile phone usage statistics - as it claims to provide to pro user.;0
Always getting hanged.Not opening.;0
When ever I go for more than 1 hour it gets crashed Pls do something;0
Installing is very slow;0
The app is crashing nd getting stuck;0
I can't sign in😡;0
Keeps giving permission errors even though I granted all permissions. Seems no longer compatible with my device.;0
After 1 week the app crashes and I have to install it again. Please fix the bug.;0
Too many bugs;0
Keep on crashing everytime. Need to uninstall and then reinstall the app again and again.;0
Only deserve big zero. Because 1) I reinstalled this app 17 times in a week. No other app crashed this much times past 1 year in my phone. Your concept is awesome.. thats is why i installed this much times. But it needs a good developer....not just like todays...NOTE : Your 4.20.1 updation failed to solve this issue..;0
I dont know....why this app isn't getting downloaded .... I can install any other app except this..... I accidentally uninstalled it ...but now i am not able to reinstall it again...pls help me.....i even talked to google and followed their steps..i was a pro user...i couldnt download;0
Forest, I change to new phone but I lost my account. Please help me. I already paid before;0
I really like this app but since few days, this app keeps stopping. I have to re-install it in order to make it work only for once. Again it stops after planting for just once. I am so irritated that i am uninstalling this app permanently.;0
When downloaded the app,it worked completely fine for about 2 days then on the 3 day the app was not operating.;0
Why this app is not installing in my phone;0
Haha you are helping by planting tree , But for that if you want to use music you should pay to devloper , What a way to get income. very nice 👍;0
All most all the features over here are for paid...;0
The app keeps crashing man. I've had to redownload so many times. What was the point in paying for this if its not even going to work.;0
Pro user here: I have 2 issues 1. After I clear/kill the app (swipe away in the multi-task mode) the Forest app ceases to work and I can use any other app. Please fix this. (Pixel 2 user) 2. Why can't Pro-users watch an Ad to double their coins? We should have the liberty to avail this feature too.

Okay ive already subscribed for pro version in another device and now in this device it is not showing how to login... It always asks to go pro version again and again.. Please help me with this situation;0
I put a tree and complete it's process. I get a notification that my tree has grown but when I open the app, The tree is withered. This has been continuing since oct2019 I've checked all my settings in phone so don't you ask me to change my permissions. There are bugs from your side. I simply want a app with tree going on sending notification when I open other app. Just give the version of 2018 back. It was best.;0
The app keeps crashing on my device everytime I need to delete it and re download it from play store. It wastes my mobile data and my time taken for redownloading it. I am a user of pro version. It's annoying that a paid version of the app keeps crashing;0
Suddenly the app will stop working and I have to reinstall it again. And each time I install this app I'm loosing my data . App is excellent but this issue is horrible. I already sent mail addressing this issue but no response and same thing is repeating. I'm facing the same problem again. It's horrible. It's becoming worst it's not at all working;0

After purchase of pro version I lost all of my 500+ coins.;0
Had to reinstall this 3 times now. I already turned off the auto update feature. I keep losing my data.;0
Error issues are so much;0
Why it is not working properly ? It is stopping when I try to open. Do I need to go premium?;0
Ths app keeps stopping;0
I hate that after i study that is, after planting a tree. I have to set my break time and also start my study time again that is, plant. It should be continous without a distraction and without me having to pick my phone again. Like, e.g i shoud be able to set it that i will study for 1 hour intervals, ring, break for 5 minutes and start timer again WITHOUT PHONE PICK UP. It should ask how long per session? Will you take a break? How many sessions in total and then it stops. Reduce coins too.;0
Keeps crashing. Won't start.;0
This is such bad app I have ever used .I buy the paid version of this app but when I open the app it ask me to buy paid version again.Money also deducted from my account and I used paid version for one day but after one day when I open the app it ask me to buy pro version again.. Please resolve my issue or refund my money ...;0
Deep forest button won't work;0
This app get crashed within a day,I installed it so many times.try to fix this issue. Second thing is that y we don't get notifications after finishing a focus mode. These two are very bad issues which everyone is facing. After 5 days of report also u ppl are unable to resolve this issue. better u return the premium amount to everyone so that we can seek to some other app.;0
My app is not opening .... I have uninstall and then install many times but still facing the same problem;0
Worst;0
I installed it, used it for 50mins and planted a tree. And the app suddenly crashed and kept crashing on my Vivo Z1 pro, so I had to uninstall. Very bad first impression!;0
First it was working amazingly. But don't know what is the issue but the app isnot running anymore. I've lost all my progress. Within a month app rating gone down from 5 to 1 star. I'm feeling very embarassing to say that I hate this app!;0
I am a Pro member, still the app is getting crashed almost everyday and I have to reinstall the app everytime I use it. No support from the app developer. Seriously pathetic. Will not recommend to anyone;0
Gets crashed after 1-2 days;0
Wth , why can't I open the app !!? Ever since I buy vip then have this problem !! When I not vip , the app don't have problem !!!!😡😠😤😤;0

I have only 86 coins. But I couldn't start the count down as it has no such option. It has only and option as ' unlock it' what's that . Please fix it. It took my whole time inorder to search about that. But failed. How can I unlock with 86 coins. They don't have any alternative ways to go inside the app. It helped me in the morning but now it's making me angry;0
I cant download this app.it is really frustraiting;0
Useless.Works even after switching to another app.The deep focus mode never turns on.Im fed up.;0
Why it doesn't open in my android. It really sucks. Please do something.;0
Used for less than a day and then when I tried to use again the next day, kept crashing. Had to clear data to get the app working again but lost my progress. Was planning to use for a couple of days first as trial before getting premium but not anymore.;0

I still can't sign up or log in. Store is empty and it crashes when I press the premium tags in store. Connection errors(Tells me im not connected to a network). Deep Focus still lets me browse other apps.;0
It is 3rd time my app is crashing...every 3rd day it crashes..I updated still the same issue..my all data gets erased all the time...it's so frustrating;0
Your app does not allow to block apps for free. Then there is no use of the app. We would still take up mobile phones if we are addictive to our phones. We are not here to grow trees, we are here to reduce addiction with the help of trees and it is not possible to study without blocking apps and we also need a few apps to study also. Plz fix it I would surely give 5 stars.;0
it just crashes every time i want to set timer for no reason!!!;0
The app keeps crashing. I've to clear out all data to use all over again which is frustrating.;0
"Been reinstalling and restarting my android for few times, nothing helps but keep saying ""Forest has stopped"" why?? I just installed it for less an hour though. Really need this app. Also been reporting. Please fix this";0
This app is not working in my phone samsung galaxy m31 Can you please fix it;0
This app is not responding after updating. I am a pro user of this app and using this from last month. But after updating it at first the app store was not opening, now the whole app stopped responding.... Pl solve this problem...;0
Changed from 4 star to 1star. Basic features (allow list for example) have been moved from free to premium account. For someone like me who has been using this for years this is really bad user experiences. Unfortunately uninstalling and moving to competition.;0
After using for 2-3 days it fails to open even after clearing cache. Only option is reinstall, IF you do that you will lose your Forest earned completely. This isn't fair Team.;0
The app suddenly close and never open again. I installed 3 times the app and the 3 times happened the same thing. Is a shame;0
I was looking for an app, in order to stay focused and be more productive. Ads and coins don't work for me. I would say they're more distracting.;0
"used this app on my old device and it was good. and then i change to a new phone and the app crashes every time it says that "" Forest updated "" although i didn't enable the auto update function. i'm very disappointed because i already bought the premium. fix it please.";0
It does not work as it supposed to. I clicked the side button (button that pops up active apps), go to the home page from there, accessing other app, and the app still planting the tree even though I 'quit' the app;0
"Its not working on my phone. Whenever I opened the app it pops up with a message saying ""Foreset stopped"" . I would love to use this app on my phone .";0
Actually, at first I really liked this app. It motivated me to stay focused. I had 93 hours of forest and 2156 coins. I saved some for a new tree. Then came the update and I couldn't open the store anymore. If I tried, the app would only crash. I tried everything imaginable and finally decided to reinstall the app. Well, everything was lost. Every tree I planted, every single coin. Okay. Sad but okay. Just want to check if I can open the store now. Yeah. I couldn't.;0
It is not running in my phone...;0
Worst app ever thought it was good quality but no! This app really annoyed me now you have to pay to study properly;0
I have been using this app for a while now and I suddenly couldn't open it. It keeps crashing and I have to uninstall and install it multiple times just to work ONCE and then it will crash again. I hope you fix this because it's a bummer that I lost all my progress.;0
This app is not working and gets stopped again &again;0
This has become the second time since I reinstalled the app All the previous data had been erased and it keeps on crashing for some unknown reason;0
Chinese;0
what???? too buke in here;0
Not working now after updating;0
The idea is great but the app keeps crashing every 2 days! I need to uninstall and then reinstall it if I want it to work. Plus all of my progress is gone. Can't sign up either 👎;0
Not working;0
After the update it is crashing most of the time I open the store.;0
I love this app..but after updating i cant even open the app in my phone and cant getting any new unlock tree... Please help me to use this aap;0
After updating this app is not opening in my phone...i m using this app since 1 year now its not working... Please do something;0
I downloaded this app many times but every time when i open the app it abruptly stops and I am unable to use it. I am unable to open it because it immediately shut downs as soon as open the app.;0
Crashing;0
Keeps crashing;0
This is super interesting;0
App is great but it is crashing frequently since last update.;0
I can't access the app. At the initial use I am able to use it but after like 2 minutes I am being kicked out of the app.;0
Baska cihazda uygulamayi acabilmek icin uygulamayi satin aldim, ama asla memnun degilim, bosu bosuna almış gibi hissediyorum cok pismanim. Chrome uzantisi kesinlikle kullanisli degil hic bir fonksiyonu yok, bilgisayardan uygulamayı kullanamıyorsam satın almış olmamın da bir manası yok. telefondaki uygulamada store açılmadığı için satın almıştım ama bilgisayardan bir faydasını göremedim, telefonda kendi kendini kapatıyor, bilgisayar için telefon uygulaması gibi bir uzantının olmaması çok saçma;0
I uninstalled this app by mistake.. And when I installed it again it's not opening... Please correct it.. I need this literally!!;0
It's better;0
The purpose of this app is great and is very affective till the time the app opens normally. However, every other day I have to reinstall this app as it stops working, which is very annoying. I might have to look for an alternate app. There are serious bugs issues for android which needs fixing!;0
"This is a good app.... but the only problem is I cant use it properly.... because if I have planted a tree and come back to plant another one.... or to use any option in the app, I cant do it. It shows that ""unfortunately forest has stopped "".... there is no problem with my phone.... please repair this problem.... I liked the app.... but this problem is just annoying me....";0
Edit to reply: You never used to need all these dodgy permissions. What changed? Why do you need to read my notifications now? Update: used to love this app. Now it needs a bunch of sketchy new permissions to do the same job it used to do: keep you from using your phone. So so disappointing as now I have to let the app read all my notifications (????) or it becomes useless.;0
From the beginning of downloading this app everything was perfectly fine, I would have given it 5 stars about 2 weeks ago. Now I have given it 2 stars because as I try to open store and get new plants and trees the app crashes and closes so I am unable to get new plants. PLEASE FIX!;0
It was working fine until i had to install it again.Once i had installed it, it woukd come on as normal but then when i went in settings to put my premium in (Since i bought that) and then it just shut off abd said it wasnt responding no matter how much i tried even re-installing it..didnt work.;0
This app stops working everytime I install it. I have already taken its subscription but now everytime I open it crashes. I have reinstalled the app several times but the problem isn't solved.;0
I have enough Google Play Credits for Pro Version but while making payment a lower amount is shown. What's the problem?;0
Please check fast.. This app is not working properly.. When I open the Store for taking another tree, then the app exit.. I reinstall But again it shows the same problem...;0
The app was amazing but lately it's been crashing a lot and i had to uninstall and reinstall it and yet it keeps in crashing i lost my data and it's frustrating;0
There's so many bug. Like I need to reinstall it every day! 😥 You ask me to Use the feedback form so I can be helped but it is also not responding. All these happen after I purchase the premium. I believe in the advocacy of this app but hey! Please fix the bug!;0
The app's motive and idea is awesome. But when you press the home button to exit the app, the tree still keeps growing which should not happen. Exiting the app by pressing either back button or home button is the same. Please see this issue. I mean the plant should wither when a person exits the app by pressing home button.;0
I used to love this app and used the whitelist feature all the time so I could study PDFs on my phone. I redownloaded it recently and discovered they now put the whitelist feature behind a paywall, which basically defeats the purpose of the app for me, still a good concept but that was a big downgrade;0
I'm shocked and disappointed to see that suddenly my records from the past few days were gone, it was okay last night but when I opened the app, my trees were gone. I availed the premium version of this app, but I didn't see this errors coming. Please let me understand why it happened.;0
Everything is good, except it crashes every 2 days and I have to reinstall it;0
It is awesome app..but if it would contain the 'PAUSE' button..it would be more meaningful, as when one need to attend something in between the activity..he can't give up the tree. Moreover it leads to false analysis of focussed hours.;0
After using this app for two months, it suddenly started not responding. So I have to redownload it, nd now my all data has been lost(all the tree species nd focused hours). Plesae provide sync option so that we don't loose it again. Thank you!;0
The App is crashing while unlocking new trees.. I am not able to Unlock New Trees though I have enough coins with me;0
I have purchased the app on Play Store in September. Now that I have switched devices, I have downloaded the app again and I am trying to log in but it seems like I need to buy the app again. I haven't switched platforms, I have been using android and I am still using Android. How can I access to my premium account and my data without paying again? I have been trying to contact the support team for more than 5 days but nobody is answering;0
Something weird is happening! I got a message saying that my tree has grown even if I didn't grow one ( after I click on give up button) or even started a new one afterwards!!?? Why this is happening??!!;0
Even after reinstalling, doesn't open properly. Planted for 2 hours and now to stop timer when I opened, it doesn't function. Asks for clearing history and to start afresh. Disappointed after latest bug fixes.;0
Why does it keep crashing!!! Please fix i am premium user and it annoys me to keep reinstalling. In general i support the cause behind this app and easy application. Looking forward to hear back from you. Best Regards Adriel;0
I've saved enough coins but it won't let me buy a new tree. After clicking unlock, it just goes to a white screen. Felt disappointed because I've saved coins just to buy the tree that I want. Hopefully this gets fixed or something.;0
It's just an ordinary built-in timer, with enhanced graphics, which doesn't notify at the completion of duration set. No other purpose it serves.;0
Great app! but there is an error when I try to open the store to unlock new trees or songs it says (error: 664) I hope to fix that problem soon;0
Loved this and used this like crazy, but recently it's been crashing unexpectedly and clearing my history even though I'm a pro user. please fix it ASAP!;0
It keeps crashing on my android device. In every 24 hours i have to uninstall and reinstall the app to use it. The error message pops up stating that this app keeps closing.;0
I've been using this app for a really long time. I have new phone and when I logged, all my trees disappeared, but planting time remains the same.;0
alot of bugs, such as the friend list is inaccurate and also when you leave the app long enough it will sleep and n function, please fix asap;0
After updating ..the app is crashing ..its not working;0
I've premium version but I'm still bombarded with adverts. Also try to make this app a little bit more interesting and fun to use. Change the ugly colour scheme;0
worked just fine until last month, but the feature to double coins through an ad is lagging a lot...I updated the app but the problem as persisted;0
This app is absolutely nice app but problem with this app is it shows app stopped after some use and this happened every time with this app only don't know why ?;0
please add night mode! I study at night and the bright green screen hurts my eyes. Realluy consider this as an option tha many of us who use this app prefer a less bright screen that is better for the eyes.WE WANT NIGHT MODE!!;0
"Why does say ""an error occurred (error 664)""when I open the store to buy trees";0
App is great....but it gets closed automatically before a session ends and my plant gets ruined..;0
I can press middle button and start using Instagram and still count down continues;0
I'm not able to log in into my another mobile after payment, please provide a solution;0
Its not working i am installed this app after 2=4 hours worked then after using it doesnt opened...... Pro version buying says errors;0
i bought the premium version, and now it can't even work properly for me. Everytime i try to open the app it fails to start and i have to clear all the app history for it to start. I don't understand why my app is in the chinese version and not connected to google play. Please help.;0
"I used this app for years - until the recent update where you now have to select ""deep mode"" for it to work properly. However, ""deep mode"" means giving permission for the app to read messages and contact details. I can't understand how this invasion of privacy is necessary and I have unfortunately deleted the app.";0
Loved this app until the recent update. In order to access deep focus mode I have to grant permissions for the app I don't feel comfortable with granting and I she never had to grant these permissions before. Without granting these permissions the app is rendered useless/ a fancy timer and I'm now looking for a similar app which won't be so intrusive on my privacy. Buying the pro version was a waste of time. Two stars for what it used to be otherwise it would be one.;0
Since the last update, I dont get notifications when the tree is finished. I have already checked the FAQs, I followed the tutorial for the settings, I also contacted to the Support, but nothing has changed. I am very disappointed, because I purchased the full version, but there is always some problem with the app. (I have Xiaomi Redmi Note 7);0
turned deep mode on and it's not working. I'll give it 5 stars when it works again;0
Good but needs simple improvement = It should really have more ringtone (and a light notification) options for when the time is up. I don't want to that horrible alarm sound or have my phone vibrate after every study session in order to know when to take a break. If you don't add more sounds, please give us the option to create customized sounds/ringtones. Also, for the S9, it is unable to make a noise in silent mode, even when I give the app exception permissions.;0
Why this app not giving any notification sound after the set time?? (Everytime After updates) this is not the first time this happen. Need to unistall n insall again for the sound. N after that, all ur progress n track in the past are all lost jz cz u hv to uninstall as there are no more notification sound. (Ps : Phone not in silent!! );0
Loved this app until the recent update. It won't let you use deep focus mode without giving access for it to read your text messages. Sorry, that's a ridiculous invasion of privacy. With deep focus turned off it's basically a fancy timer. Wish I hadn't paid for the pro version. Gave an extra star because it used to be fantastic.;0
I loved this app until the latest update. The latest update requires you to give it permission to read your messages otherwise leaving the app does nothing to the tree. What's the point in this app now? Just simply growing a tree whilst I go about my usual business on my phone. There is literally no point to this app anymore unless you pay or give it access to your messages/data. Really disappointed that the creators have completely undermined the whole point of this app. Shame shame shame.;0
Just stupid. Got the paid version. Confusing interface. Too many options and paid for gimmicks. Where do you press start? Asks for too many permissions for what it does. Intrusive popups. Constant error 608. . Where do you press start? Constantly asks to login. Also, show a timer FFS. And still i get adds to double coins.;0
Ads don't work to double points anymore;0
Why the 'deep focus mode'? It defeats the purpose of the app now. Enabling it requires permissions that a user would not be comfortable sharing! And I even paid for the app recently. Disappointed.;0
I really love this app, but I can't find any way to make it work on my new (Huawei Y7) phone! I've followed all the instructions in the FAQ and tutorials online, but my trees still continue to grow regardless of whatever other apps I'm using. I hope this compatibility issue is possible to fix and that it gets fixed soon, because I absolutely love this app otherwise.;0
I used to love this app, but it updated and is requesting access to all of my contact information & content of any messages I send or receive. Please revert it back to how it was :( I don't mind if my tree accidentally dies from my news app, but I do mind if this app reads all of my texts. Thank you, and I hope this is quickly resolved.;0
It's a really nice app but it doesn't make a notification sound on my phone no matter what settings I change. Almost defeats the purpose when it can't tell you the time is up.;0
I don't like the new update with super focus, the fact that I can leave the app without my tree dying defeats the whole point of the app. If I want to turn on deep focus which is basically the normal function of the app before the update I have to agree to forest reading my messages, which is ridiculous. I bought the premium version of this app, I would love if they didn't spy on me;0
Syncing doesn't work. That was the whole point of upgrading to the Pro version. I log most of my time in the Firefox browser plugin, and it never shows up in the app. I also lost my account. My account wasn't authenticating, so I logged out. When I tried to log back in, it didn't recognize my email (even using Forgot Password). I ended up creating a new account with the same email I know I used before, losing all of my coins. You guys should look into any backend issues with syncing and accounts. Thanks.;0
Update: I did all the steps.. still not working... It is getting frustrating 😓 I really love this app. But off late it just keeps crashing. Can anybody help? Updated: Thanks for the reply! There was no auto update option in my phone settings. So, I have disabled auto update in google play. Will it work?;0
I loved this app until everything was blocked behind a paywall. I just wanted a place so that I wouldn't get distracted when doing homework on my phone. The fact that even whitelisting is blocked makes it so I can't even really use the app. I'll probably just have to look for another app because this app now expects you to have multiple devices, while I have only have one, rendering this app useless.;0
Really loved the app until the recent changes w.r.t deep focus mode. Liked it better when it was the default setting. Now the app requires lot many permissions to enable that which I'm not comfortable to allow. Including reading notifications. Guess I will be using it less and less and eventually uninstall;0
At first, i really loved it, it was helpful. Not until i lost my coins. It would prolly be great if u can at least log in to save ur earned coins, but if u try to log in, a payment will pop out.. Uninstalling this now and will try another app. So sad i had to say good bye to this app. Its so cute but its so stingy..;0
This app is causing me a lot of trouble.... whenever I close the app and open it again, the app says that forest isn't working....so I have to delete and download it again and use it 10 times a day.....and also I have paid premium membership. I have an android phone;0
Awesome idea. I liked the app so much I bought the premium version on my last phone. Now, that I've switches to a new one, it doesn't let me restore my purchase. I tried deleting all other accounts and still can't restore successfully.;0
The recent update is bothering with all the permission we need to omit from google. The previous version is way better and i feel like the latest update strips me off my privacy. By floating app you mean, if i left my bank app open and used this app will that also allows the app tp float ofln top of that? Really bothersome. I been a member for almost 2 yrs now and this recent update kinda push me off tract of a possiblity of leaked bank info or important private transactions.;0
Motivates me to actually do my daily tasks! But lately it has been crashing!!! And has Chinese characters and such i keep uninstalling and installing it but itd crash again. Please fix this!! 😭😤🙏🏻;0
Used to really love this app and it really helped me start working until I found out that none of my trees die when I switch apps. Tried all the instructions in the FAQs section of their website but nothing worked. Great idea but super disappointed it doesn't work in my phone.;0
It was working fine until recently, I bought new bush but when I have successfully planted (it told me it was successful) I saw it planted the last tree I had chosen on previous study session and 4 out of 7 trees were dead (even tho it said I planted 7 successful trees). The notification also doesn't work;0
I just bought the pro version, great app but some menus fail to load, achievements, store and so on just load continously, fixing this would be great. I reinstalled the app but it did nothing. Also random menus sometimes fail to open completely.;0
Cool concept but an app like this requires too much focus of its own which only pulls attention away from your intended project. Maybe it would be better with a more comprehensive tutorial but I doubt it. I prefer something straightforward, like Screen Time.;0
There is a problem with syncing my trees. And now that I've it working on my single device,it shows me to log in everytime I try to buy a tree.;0
Works okay... But everything costs so much in game currency. I am very sick of hearing the rain in the forest and that one mourning dove. Was really excited at first for this app. Kind of disappointed that your reward for staying on task is so minimal.;0
This was a great app, until the update 😔 please fix the bugs and errors. The previous version is a lot better. I already updated to the latest version. There's always an error when i go to the store.;0
Needs sketchy permissions to work properly! It used to not ask for these permission like allowing it to see my messages/personal info and control my apps. Like what?? Idk, it sketched me out. I used to love this app but it changed!;0
"Not sure what the point is when you can still access any app without interrupting your trees as long as you leave this running in the background? Note: the ""lock forest to stay in foreground"" option is selected";0
I wish there was a clearer distinction between the Pro and Free modes. All the popups I found during exploration just deterred me and I found the timer didn't even work properly. It was pretty though and I like the concept.;0
Absolutely loved the app until the newest update. Sorry but the deep focus asks for too many permissions that weren't there before. (Thank you for your prompt response);0
I was disappointed coz it did not make any sound notifications once the tree has been planted. After following all instructions and enabling all permissions for the past few days. Still no luck.;0
I really love this. But when I want to use it for second time, this apps crashed. I've uninstalled for many times but it still the same. Please do something;0
The latest update seems to have disabled notification sounds. I have tried every suggested solution and it still doesn't work making Forest and Sleeptown effectively useless for me. They were good when they worked.;0
So it was good until yesterday .. Whenever I tap on the store it keeps refreshing and never opens, I can't unlock any tree or even check them out. I sent a picture . Thank you for the quick response.;0
I love this app, it helps me focus on studying. And I'm keen on trees, it's so amazing Edit after 2 days in free version, i can't open it anymore. I don't know why. I deleted it and downloaded it again. But, after 2 days, i can't open this app;0
Used to be so great but for the new updates.. What's the point of Deep Focus option? It was well when it was simple and effective..;0
I used to really love this app, but lately it won't notify me when the timer is up. It's hard to keep track of how much you're working;0
Please give us a way of disabling the red notification dot. It serves no purpose if I can't tell what it's for. Get rid of it or make it more clear what it's indicating. UX should never be an afterthought.;0
I'm a pro user, worked great initially but it is not opening and continuously stopping. Please fix this asap.;0
Waa supposed to try premium but my payment won't push through. It keeps saying that I have the wrong google password when in fact I inputed the correct one.;0
From what I remember, the whitelist feature used to be free. Very disappointed in this now being a paid feature;0
I find the concept of this app absolutely stupid I don't think people are gonna care about if a virtual plant dies if u use an app and the only thing it does is give u a notification as an incentive. What the app should do is whenever someone opens an app forest should open and display over the app this will prevent others from casually using other apps while their work is in progress.;0
This has helped me so much ❤️ I love the app but I swear my coins disappear?!? Anyone else having this issue?;0
Crashes all the time;0
Confused I planted a tree but instead of killing the tree, i can just leave it running in the background, and the tree still grows;0
Nice app but I want to unlock the whitelist feature but it's not working . Please look to it as I want to unlock the whitelist feature for free .;0
The app used to work perfectly now it lets me do anything without the tree dying I apologize for two stars but the problem is very annoying;0
When I close forest from resent apps then I can use all apps even I on deep focus mode. Pls fix this problem.;0
I like this app, but its useless. If i go on a different app, it just gives me a warning and carries on. Would be better if there was some sort of consequence for using other apps.;0
Good app. Sadly it onlt worked for a day. Now it crashes instantly.;0
When i lock my screen , the trees will die . So many time i reinstall app and give all permition but no positive result .;0
Keeps hanging even after you actually pay money for the premium version.;0
Why don't I get any notification when the time is over? It's very disappointing. Pls fix this;0
Cannot create new tags. Even deleted a few to test if it was because I had reached an undeclared quota;0
Confusing and what they don't tell you before you download is that you have to pay for mostly all the features;0
There should have deep vibration mode after completion of 25 min...initial version had that setting...I am unable to notice the completion of task as it vibrate for a moment only..plz rectify it...Otherwise this is an excellent app!!;0
Super;0
This is good, but i can't use in my phone for more than a day, Its not opening in my samsung note10 lite. Please suggest a way to rectify this issue.;0
The purpose of this app is great and is very affective till the time the app opens normally. However, every other day I have to reinstall this app as it stops working, which is very annoying. I might have to look for an alternate app. There are serious bugs issues for android which needs fixing!;0
I just update this app & now app not responding 😥;0
Its really nice app for making us focused but every day it doesnt opens and all my data goes ad every day i have to install uninstall very annoying now fed up plzz fix it as fast as u can getting so much irritated 😠😠😠what d hell. Yar every two days this app is geting crash and doesn't open just tell wwhat to do such a headache;0
Edit to reply: You never used to need all these dodgy permissions. What changed? Why do you need to read my notifications now? Update: used to love this app. Now it needs a bunch of sketchy new permissions to do the same job it used to do: keep you from using your phone. So so disappointing as now I have to let the app read all my notifications (????) or it becomes useless.;0
Crashing again;0
can't open this app;0
i recently started using this app more and i love the whole concept of this, but i have a lot of problems. 1. i'm updated to the latest version om the play store but on the app it says i am still on 4.13 so i can't get the new trees in store. 2. i want to buy premium but the methods of paying are in yen only but i need to pay in cad since i am in canada this is very frustrating and i hope you could let non premium users make a forest acc because you cant save your acc data otherwise :(;0
I have enough Google Play Credits for Pro Version but while making payment a lower amount is shown. What's the problem?;0
App is not even opening, wt is the point then;0
doesn't work anymore, I can not go to the store to purchase different tree species anymore, forest stops responding and I'm back on my home screen. I can't have any sounds and the coins I earn disappear ): I don't like it anymore. it's pointless, but these glitches have actually made me more desciplined, and I don't use my phone even without the fear of the plant dying. the app sucks and I can't care more about reaching out to the developers /:;0
The app is not opening please fix it It was running smooth before.;0
Its a good app. Its crashing on a daily basis;0
(pro user) I've been using this app for a long time and never had any problems with it but recently the app keeps crashing and even after re-installing it (works for a couple of minutes), it crashes again! The only way to actually use it is to use the forest extension on my laptop. This is getting really frustrating and I actually liked the app. Can you please fix this issue? Because it seems a lot of other people seems to be experiencing this.;0
Nice;0
The app is good, but there are glitches. After some time when the person tries to open the app. It showed to clear the data of the app. This deletes all the storage of the app the coins collected, the forest made. This leads to the disruption of the person's analysis of their focussed work. Hope you'll soon rectify this error. And hope the soon comes early.;0
App kept on crashing. I had to delete and download the app three times this week alone. I love the app. It has been very helpful. But this issue has been very annoying;0
Very nice 👏;0
It requires some pretty intense permissions in order to provide the best experience. It may work for you, but it didn't really work well for me.;0
The app's good but after the update I'm having issues like the app's not recording the info after the completion of the timer, it just crashes and starts from the beginning.;0
This app is still not responsinh in my phone it keeps on closing i have upated it for like a thousand time;0
This app stops working everytime I install it. I have already taken its subscription but now everytime I open it crashes. I have reinstalled the app several times but the problem isn't solved.;0
i bought the premium version, and now it can't even work properly for me. Everytime i try to open the app it fails to start and i have to clear all the app history for it to start. I don't understand why my app is in the chinese version and not connected to google play. Please help.;0
start crashing right after 2 days..but the idea is good;0
It is very good but if i don't use it everyday than all my coins are gone and i have to replant it.;0
"This is a good app.... but the only problem is I cant use it properly.... because if I have planted a tree and come back to plant another one.... or to use any option in the app, I cant do it. It shows that ""unfortunately forest has stopped "".... there is no problem with my phone.... please repair this problem.... I liked the app.... but this problem is just annoying me....";0
This app is wonderful but every time i click the store icon , the app stops suddenly If this issues is solved by developer I'll definitely give 5 stars;0
The app was amazing but lately it's been crashing a lot and i had to uninstall and reinstall it and yet it keeps in crashing i lost my data and it's frustrating;0
Everytime when i open this app it gets closed and says forest has unfortunately stopped. And two stars for i think this is the best productive app for studying and focusing;0
From the beginning of downloading this app everything was perfectly fine, I would have given it 5 stars about 2 weeks ago. Now I have given it 2 stars because as I try to open store and get new plants and trees the app crashes and closes so I am unable to get new plants. PLEASE FIX!;0
After updating ..the app is crashing ..its not working;0
Well I saw a lot of people using this app, and base on they're ratings they say it's good but for me It's not, the app constantly crashes if I click some buttons inside the apps, It always crashes whenever I try or need to use it, Please fix it I really want to use this :<;0
Not working great;0
Please check fast.. This app is not working properly.. When I open the Store for taking another tree, then the app exit.. I reinstall But again it shows the same problem...;0
The App is crashing while unlocking new trees.. I am not able to Unlock New Trees though I have enough coins with me;0
Everything is good, except it crashes every 2 days and I have to reinstall it;0
Worst ap;0
It was working fine until i had to install it again.Once i had installed it, it woukd come on as normal but then when i went in settings to put my premium in (Since i bought that) and then it just shut off abd said it wasnt responding no matter how much i tried even re-installing it..didnt work.;0
It is awesome app..but if it would contain the 'PAUSE' button..it would be more meaningful, as when one need to attend something in between the activity..he can't give up the tree. Moreover it leads to false analysis of focussed hours.;0
I hate when the sounds ads come out out of nowhere, eventho i close this app in the background;0
It is very interesting app I like this app very much;0
I don't get any benefit by using this app..But picture quality is nice..;0
turned deep mode on and it's not working. I'll give it 5 stars when it works again;0
I can't use it after updating this app that's the drawback of the app otherwise it's quite good;0
alot of bugs, such as the friend list is inaccurate and also when you leave the app long enough it will sleep and n function, please fix asap;0
why does this app crashes so much!!!!!!!;0
Something weird is happening! I got a message saying that my tree has grown even if I didn't grow one ( after I click on give up button) or even started a new one afterwards!!?? Why this is happening??!!;0
"i just downloaded it and used it once (set timer 2 hours). after the timer finished, the app wont open several times until it told me to erase all app data :( my treeeeeeeeee 🥺😭 so yeah, not good app but it kinda cute";0
The app is crashing a lot and I have to re-install it averytime I want to use it. I really like the app but now it's irritating. I hope the issue to be resolved as soon as possible because I really need this app.;0
After using this app for two months, it suddenly started not responding. So I have to redownload it, nd now my all data has been lost(all the tree species nd focused hours). Plesae provide sync option so that we don't loose it again. Thank you!;0
A few months ago i downloaded this app and it's good. But recently, i can't open this app anymore. Tried reinstall for many times but still crash. I always update this app but still the same;0
worked just fine until last month, but the feature to double coins through an ad is lagging a lot...I updated the app but the problem as persisted;0
I can press middle button and start using Instagram and still count down continues;0
I've premium version but I'm still bombarded with adverts. Also try to make this app a little bit more interesting and fun to use. Change the ugly colour scheme;0
I want to learn about it;0
This app is absolutely nice app but problem with this app is it shows app stopped after some use and this happened every time with this app only don't know why ?;0
It really motivated me to focus because of the tree, but imagine to my dismay when it crashed and all my past planted trees deleted and all my coins lost and I can't even retrieve them. I know that the reason for this app is for the user to focus, but it's just dishearting to see all your planted trees lost in just a snap, is it because I'm just a free user? I'm planning to upgrade once I collected some coins and tree but now it's all lost, never mind. I uninstalled because of disappointment.;0
It's okay but not amazing;0
"Why does say ""an error occurred (error 664)""when I open the store to buy trees";0
I'm shocked and disappointed to see that suddenly my records from the past few days were gone, it was okay last night but when I opened the app, my trees were gone. I availed the premium version of this app, but I didn't see this errors coming. Please let me understand why it happened.;0
I keep having to uninstall and install the app sonce it keeps crashing and doesnt open.;0
please add night mode! I study at night and the bright green screen hurts my eyes. Realluy consider this as an option tha many of us who use this app prefer a less bright screen that is better for the eyes.WE WANT NIGHT MODE!!;0
It would be nice if we could see others who are studying at the same time (toggled by global, country, and friends) for added competitive spirit. — Also change color themes so we can choose colors other than default green. — The features are very limited compared to other study apps. I want to use Forest but really, it is a like a kitchen timer and never had major updates with feature additions. Every update is a tree reskin lol ヽ(*´□`)ﾉﾞ;0
Great app! but there is an error when I try to open the store to unlock new trees or songs it says (error: 664) I hope to fix that problem soon;0
Why does it keep crashing??I love this app but every now and then it keeps crashing and I have to reinstall it everytime. PLEASE FIX IT;0
I've been using this app for a really long time. I have new phone and when I logged, all my trees disappeared, but planting time remains the same.;0
I have downloaded it 4 times because the app opens only on the day of download...the very next day it won't open n i have to install it again;0
No Doubt This is a Great App but it is now causing errors. App Crashes all the time when i completed my first session of Study. Now I am Facing very much Problem.Kindly work on this issue.;0
After I purchased the pro version. All my previous tress were deleted. Contacted support. They told me to log out and for the past couple of days I have been unable to log back in. Unable to view friends list or plant trees with friends😑 the support team is also not helping me quite well.;0
I used to love this app and used the whitelist feature all the time so I could study PDFs on my phone. I redownloaded it recently and discovered they now put the whitelist feature behind a paywall, which basically defeats the purpose of the app for me, still a good concept but that was a big downgrade;0
Gud app;0
I love this app but it's crashing very frequently and it's very annoying.;0
Keeps crashing all the time and doesn't open;0
It's a good app, but from last two times it crash out and say to restore it which leads to all my previous trees to die, whenever new updates come!!;0
Please help!!!! I have installed this app twice first time it works for 2 days and then got crashed and I have to reinstall and due to which my data got removed. And again it works for 2 days and crashed.... Please help;0
My app is crashing every time..I've updated it and reinstalled it several times yet the problem is same;0
Frequent crashes;0
i like the idea of planting trees and making a forest..which is really satisfaying. But this app doesn't notify me when the timer is up and it's time for break.. i have to check if the timer is still running and then set the break myself..which is the worst part! and it doesn't allow me to set multiple timer with breaks in between! if they can fix these issues..it would be a useful app;0
writing this is not too good forest stay focused is good it what picture is good we can study while using our friends by opening are Bluetooth Wi-Fi and all of them but I am not happy from this forest stay focused we cannot give only one star otherwise I may give it a zero I am fad from this forest stay focused and am going to delete it's was trap am requesting please download this app it had lots off lots off lots off lots of AD so you don't like lots of AD no so don't download it please.;0
It's too heavy And doesn't have so much options I mean 62mb🤯;0
When I'm plying video on another app which is in whitelist, then my plant die 🤔🤔😭😭;0
Please help me I really love this app and addicted to it but it fails to open & restores by clearing history after every 5-6 hrs of use;0
Paid version has main features, otherwise useless app;0
I used this app last year and found it helpful. However, now when I downloaded it, I saw that there was a large number of bloat messages and permissions. Not finding it helpful anymore.;0
It gets closing very often. I had to reinstall it plenty of times which is frustrating;0
I really appreciate your quick response but there doesn't seem to be any improvements even after following the steps you asked to. The app is still the same and it doesn't open at all! This is disappointing now;0
"I used this app for years - until the recent update where you now have to select ""deep mode"" for it to work properly. However, ""deep mode"" means giving permission for the app to read messages and contact details. I can't understand how this invasion of privacy is necessary and I have unfortunately deleted the app.";0
Nop...you have to by all the main things...doesn't worth it;0
This app is really good , I just loved using it but the reason for giving 2star is this app keeps crashing. I had to uninstall the app and reinstall it every single day as a result all my progress is used to get deleted. If this system was ok then this app really deserves 5stars. Hope you look up to this matter;0
Motivates me to actually do my daily tasks! But lately it has been crashing!!! And has Chinese characters and such i keep uninstalling and installing it but itd crash again. Please fix this!! 😭😤🙏🏻;0
Its crashing again and again!;0
It keeps crashing on my android device. In every 24 hours i have to uninstall and reinstall the app to use it. The error message pops up stating that this app keeps closing.;0
It's getting stopped many times;0
Crashes all the time;0
The app keeps on crashing everyday I open it , even after I got a pro account . This feels really irritating .;0
I like the app and its concept but it crashes way too much. I almost have to reinstall it every time I need to run it.;0
Its not working i am installed this app after 2=4 hours worked then after using it doesnt opened...... Pro version buying says errors;0
"A good app for tracking productivity, but that's all it does. I think it needs to provide a bit more motivation to do those high focus tasks. So far the only ""reward"" is a few points which we can save but it might as well not be there because its so low. The purchasable items are over 2000 points, which will take a long time to save. So the app does get a bit boring after a while. That being said its still good for its primary function as being a ""tracker"". But I think it can be way more.";1
This app has really helped me to focus on other things I want to do. I find it satisfying seeing plants grow the more I use this app and detach myself from my phone. However, I'm only giving 4 stars. Many of the trees and plants cost 1,200 or 2,000 coins and even if you complete a timer that's set for 2 hours, you only get about 69 coins. You have the option to double that by watching an ad but needless to say that's not gonna help much. If this were to be worked out, I'd rate 5 stars.;1
"The app is highly recommended and one of the popular ones. But after trying many other apps, it can use more features than just ""plant trees"" as reward and blocking mode. Plus most items in the shop cost a lot of coins, which means you have limited resources to decorate your forest with a free account. So the app will get boring to most of the free users after some time. The app is good, but it should upgrade to more exciting features (like daily plans, cheap shop items, etc) for free users.";1
"my review used to be 5-star, and I wrote a whole darn paragraph about how amazing forest was. it still is ! however, whenever I enter the app, the app immediately kicks me out !! please fix this, I've tried reporting a problem but it's been days and I haven't gotten back from anyone and the problem is still not fixed !! I would really love to give forest 5-stars again so please fix this, I love forest :"") update: tried uninstalling and installing the app, still no change !! :((";1
Hello, as I updated the app to the latest version I could not open the in-app store to check out for the newer trees and sounds. When I clicked on the store the app automatically logged me out of it. I refreshed my phone a number of times and it still happens, I assume it is some bug? Please acknowledge this and fix it. Thank you.;1
Very good efforts Everyone who want to focus in their life, make their time more productive should definately download this app. It is very helpful. BUT the only bad thing about this app is that it requires money to create an account. See, users always seek to things or features that they can get for free. I think making the creation of an account free would help your app to spread amongst people.;1
It's a very great app, really good one,it's motivating and you just addict yourself to your work just to collect the coins and open other features.I really appreciate the way it's constructed and definitely recommend it. But the reason I reduced one star is because you didn't add the screen rotate feature. Please do add because I really need it due to some problem.I love this app and that's why I really need that screen rotate on. Please,I request you to do it and I'm really happy the features🙂;1
It's a good app, keeps you focused, you can buy different trees, But recently, I've developed a problem with it and I can't buy any more trees. When I try to, it glitches out :( so I'm stuck with 10 thousand coins but I can't buy anything with it Edit : that problem is fixed. Thank you !;1
It's a great app for staying away from the phone while attending to one's tasks. As not all tasks are born equal, I'd really like to see taller trees for longer focus periods. It would be rewarding, plus the forest would look nicer and unique based on one's day;1
i dont really know what to say because the app keeps crashing before i even try to open it, i dont know if its because of my phone or the app. it wont open. however, the developers were quick to respond and recommended a solution. ill be back to edit my review and see if it works :);1
It's really nice. I want to upgrade to premium. My language is set to English but options during upgrading are set in Chinese. I don't understand it. So i can't continue with the upgrade. Can you assist me how? Thank you...;1
This app is amazing except for one problem. When I got the premium version, most of my progress was erased! I'm glad some of it remained, but I worked for so long on that! Can you do something to fix that? Thanks.;1
I really like the app, love my forest and stay at a higher level of concentration. But I apparently reached the limit of real-trees, which is only 5 and way too low! Otherwise a 5 Star experience!;1
nice app but the free version is really limited. should allow at least 1-2 apps for whitelist, and more in premium. I just want to be able to jot notes/thoughts, that's it.;1
For those that need a little help in the anti-online distraction stakes. The app is fun to use and is working for me. I like the little, built in rewards. I have the Google Chrome extension plus the phone app so that I lock myself out of all the websites such as Twitter and online news. But I would like a 'rest day' function though. I was nearing my 30 straight days of concentration reward and had a day off my PhD... I sit down to work the next day and find that I've been reset to zero. nooooooooooo fair. we all need a day off.;1
Love this app! However I have one request. I want to be able to set a tag before I plant a tree, otherwise I have to update it all the time after the tree has grown. I'm not sure if there's already a way to do this.;1
I think I'm getting more done, world domination here I come. I have premium version, I use the Deep Focus which prevents you using select apps (you can always give up but I find just the reminder that in trying to focus is enough to keep it going) but sometimes it doesn't realise I have the app open so I end up getting distracted. Also, I'd really like an automatic focus to activate at set times. I'm thinking in the evening when I want to get ready for bed. Still, it has stopped distractions;1
Have been enjoying using this. Helped in many ways. I would love to see auto planting the next forest after a configurable break. Those things would be a great add to the app;1
I'm using the app very often and it's very helpful for productive use of time . But I'm troubled with installing the app repeatedly as it won't open after certain time period from installed moment .;1
I enjoy the app but for some reason the end noise once my trees are planted no longer happens apart from that I enjoy the reward of planting for tasks a d seeing the results;1
Really nice app, the older version with the display on the lock screen showing countdown was useful.. please bring that back.;1
so far so good and almost perfect app, it really helps me stay focused by reminding me to go back to the app whenever I leave, pro features are definitely worth purchasing. One more addition I'll like to see is the ability to sett up a timer chain like let's say 25mins-5minbreak-25mins so I don't have to manually go on a break and then back into another session all the time;1
This app has really helped with my productivity alot so much so I decided to get the premium version. I only have one issue and that is, I wish there could be an option to add extra time to a session, for example if I set the time for 20 minutes but my work session requires me to do 25, that's 5 minutes I cant add on the app and it really frustrates me, I know other apps have it and really hope you guys can add it too.;1
This app is surprisingly helpful in stopping you from using your phone. The fact that the more coins spent on the app will plant more real trees making it extra fun.;1
Just got it. It says i have to be a pro version user to enable the setting shere if I close the app it effects the trees. I think its called Extremely Focused or sometning along those lines. It seems to be challenging to find this option to get the pro version. any help?;1
I like the app a lot and got the pro version as well. The only thing I'm missing for 5 stars is a stopwatch function. Sometimes I want to study something until I'm done with it (e.g. go through a stack of flashcards before going to bed). Currently I have to guesstimate the time it will take and set a timer for it. I'd love to just measure the time with the app and get the tree when I'm done with the task.;1
This app has helped me in so many ways!!! ❤️ This app helps you focus in your work, if you set the Deep focus mode, your tree will either if you leave the app. So, as you are working, a tree starts growing. You can choose how long you want to work for and the time of the break as well! I am actually having my break now. Definitely recommend, no ads, but you have to be a member to do certain things.;1
this is a super helpfull app. It really motivates me to stay focussed and easily tracks my hours. I would however like to continue growing a tree after a short break in stead planting a new one. I work for short periods of time separated by 5 to 10 minute breaks. As a result I can't grow any trees beyond the first stage. I hope this feature could be added.;1
Serve it's purpose, but it can be run in background which should be neglect the whole Idea of note using Phone when focusing on other things;1
Cute and creative tree designs, simple interface and easy to use.;1
This app is very good. Thanks for building the app. It makes my time table easier. Now i can study with enough time. and I also do other works by this. there would be 5stars for this app, but i'll give it 4 stars. Because, there is just one music track free. other one costs 500coins. you should unlock at least 2 music tracks. Overall, I recommend y'all who wants to improve in study and decrease laziness.😄;1
Using this app is better than just setting an alarm for study. You get to see your forest grow which can give you a sense of pride for the work you've done. Only drawback is that if you use deep focus to limit your use of the phone, you have to pay for premium in order to whitelist apps. You'd want to whitelist apps in order to use any tool like the calculator or the internet. Locking off whitelisting could hinder the benefit of the app depending on the person. For me though, it's pretty noice.;1
During a planting process, i have completed my task and want to do something else , but there is no task completed button or anything like that, so had multiple dead trees :( But overall very interesting and unique concept and great functionality. Thank you, for helping me to stop procrastinating. And i will give it a 5star when the above mentioned issue is fixed.;1
"This is a cute app. I enjoy the extra incentive to keep focused on what I'm doing and not get distracted on little things, blogs and notifications. Growing a cute forest or garden over time brings some joy to my productivity. 💕🌳🌹🌺💐🌲 Edit: I also love that there's no subscription or intrusive payment walls so that makes this app 5🌟";1
This app is really beneficial specialy for studying. Please add more music with higher quality. Or s.th new to buy.;1
My favorite app for studying! I love the music and sound effects and how chill and relaxing this is! would give 5 stars but I think you should remove needing to get pro for accounts, friends and planting irl trees, I want to help plant more trees but I don't have pro.. and playing with friends is more motivating, but overall love this and totally recommend!;1
Great app, I just wish there was more. Planting a tree is fine, but it would be so much more engaging for me if there was a garden to take care of, or a camp of some kind, something personal and customizable that would mean something. It bothers me not having the control where to plant the tree.;1
Wonderful meditation app that keeps you away from your phone. My only complaint is lack of background ambiance choices. I'd make all the current ones free and add more of them at a fair price. I highly recommend this app with that considered.;1
Better app than others pomodoro timers. Just one thing which i would prefer is that inspite of simple font style make the font style to set as per the default font of the phone. I mean that i use some other font so for me this application fonts looks quite boring which doesn't make it fit for me or maybe for other users as well. Rest everything is excellent.;1
Perfect but I also use the chrome add-on and it duplicates the simultaneous focus periods and the stats show 2x of my actual focus time. Can you add also a pause period that will not let you to leave the app but run to an emergent issue just in case, then turn back without killing your tree?;1
Good app - the guilt over killing a tree is quite effective (for me, at least). Big wish though - the app forces the screen to stay on which drains battery life, but doesn't support horizontal screen orientation so plugging in the power cord to the bottom of my Galaxy s10 is super awkward. Please add horizontal screen support!;1
I liked using this it really helped me to avoid phone and staying focused . But I have an issue I bought the pro version of this app ,after some days I deleted and reinstalled this , and my pro version was gone 😔 ........ I Support that don't buy pro version of this app not worth it .;1
Great app and I totally love it. But recent deep foucs mode asks for permissions which makes me uncomfortable. Like access to all my notifications including my messages, ignoring battery optimization to allow app to run always in the background. These are my main concerns.;1
I just started with Forest and love it so far. It's very engaging and I want to grow a beautiful forest! I'd love to be able to program a full pomodoro sequence of 4 times 25 min focus, 5 min breaks and then the last break is 30 minutes. Pre-programming such complex cycles of my choice, for example one for work, one for social media, one for reading.... would be very useful.;1
I'm giving this app 4 stars because if you don't have the paid version you can't add apps to your whitelist and your tree will die if you exit the app which i think is really inconvenient and although i understand the creators need a source of money to keep the app going at least this feature should have been free. But overall the app design is really cute and simple and it has helped me focus on my studying more;1
Ignore battery optimization is always turning off automatically without using the app for long time;1
Its really helpful but it stops guiding u back to the app once it is removed from recent apps but still go on counting down and the tree wont be dried.. So u can use phone but wont be bothered by the app at all.. I request u to fix it soon.. Thank u...it is fixed in the updated version;1
Very helpful, there's ofcourse an alarm clock or a timer to do the job but this is kinda satisfying. Also the statistical analysis helps me understand the time I actually spent getting stuff done rather than just staring at it.;1
Really helps me work more efficiently. Only thing you could add is some sort of labelling to allow you to see how much time you have allocated to different tags each day. Also- make the bar chart colour coded corresponding with the different tag colours.;1
Clean app and works well. I was really hoping that my time NOT touching the phone would help grow a forest, but it seems like I have to maually set it, and then only at a 120 minute max. I'd love a more passive mode to help incentivize me from wasting hours on the phone. That or being able to set LONG hours;1
Amazing. This helps me not do stuffs on my phone while I work or study. The only thing is the fact that whitelist is for people with Pro, so I can't use my calculator. Weh. My only suggestion is having whitelist for everyone, but only AFTER whitelist is available to everyone, will I give it 5 stars.;1
I'm not getting free coins thru video. It is showing some error 0. ple fix this asap. This is happening very often now. I have updated a lot of times, but still I'm not getting free coins.;1
I like this app so much . It make me stay Productive. I wish it had a pause button too... but it made me focus in my studies. As a student I would like to recommend this app to you guys;1
I have been using this app, this is just one gorgeous 'stay focused ' app, but at times when I want the app to open it shows stopped and I have to reinstall.;1
Really helpful, but would be even more helpful if there were exceptions for authenticator apps like Google authenticator or duo, it's annoying when I lose my progress because I have to perform 2FA for login.;1
I dont get the end timer alerts. It has been happening for while now. The planting timer will end but I will not get notification alerts. I get alerted when I open the app though.;1
This app is helpful to say the least. I use it to get work done and it is simple to look at but I think it must be very well designed because i have gotten a lot of tasks done now.;1
For some reason I set a white list and after a while it resets by itself, and the worst of all is that it actually adds TIKTOK always in exceptions even thought I unselect it all the time... Are you kidding me?;1
I really loved it and purchase the app after using it more than a year, just for planting a real tree after focusing many hours, But Tree stoped withering after purchased the app! I want to know what's wrong?;1
Love the new usability and strictness over apps without worrying about killing my tree absent mindedly. Saves me so many hours a week. Wish the timeline had a visual update + the a pop up for my tag when I plant because I find it very easy and inconsequential to forget;1
I really enjoy using this. Sadly I couldn't find The Cake Tree..though I updated the app. 😣;1
The app is just awesome now. Thank you seekrtech for fixing the bugs;1
It gives good positive feedback by growing a forest and seeing it grow as you stay focused;1
"I don't know what happening but the store doesn't work anymore and i keep getting this ""error code :664"" ... Edit 09-07-20 : i don't know what happened or what u did but it works just fine now, thank you ^^";1
Helps to motivate me to finish my assignments🌸 I wish it was like the old update for the plants though... the minutes you spend working grows different stages of the plant for the free plant. That one was more fun.;1
It is going to help you if you really want to focus. But when after I activate deep focus mood it still excess me to enter my other apps some times. Overall it really help to do better.;1
Crashes on opening the store. Please fix it.;1
I have some suggestions to make this great app better 1. Be able to see the hourly breakdown of all your tags 2. Choose which tag to allocate to your study session before starting the session;1
An excellent app for focusing on whatever you are doing..I would recommend this app for people who are easily distracted like me.;1
App is good for the purpose it serves...but maximum features are available only in the pro version for which I took away one star.;1
Nice experience .this app more valuable in my study timing concetration.;1
Good if you want to stay focus but you can't open any other apps if you want just like i want to open the calculator but it won't let you open the app.Otherwise it is good .;1
This app is helpful 👍 😀 but should have some more section like tasks or something for students;1
The 4.8.6 version works just fine, when i get out of the app it comes up immediately. Now i have to get back manually, even answering call causes my tree to wither (xiaomi redmi note 5);1
This app is very productive but trees and plants in this are very costly .Hope the developers reduce the costs and provide more features in free version because pro very users are very limited Thanks;1
I have pro account but the aap is not so well managed as there is no reminding alarm regading end of time and no alarm for break over as well which makes this aap less productive.;1
Simple yet attractive, minimalist app for you to build your focus. Do give this one a try.;1
It's actually very effective for me. Nice design. Easy instructions. Nice for beginner who want to be a productive person.;1
It is great . But i really want to suugest that u shold also add a option for pausing the countdown because i think everyone needs it. Rather than it , it is fabulous;1
It's a good app I just wish non premium members could set certain apps your not allowed to go on because if you don't have that there's no point in having the app;1
Great app, helps focusing, very calming. But it would be better if the real forest planting was free.;1
I came here after watching himeesh madan video and like the review of this app but before installing it i checked from which country this app is o found it was Chinese so i became sad and started finding it's alternative and then i revisit the site and i searched almost for hour finding from where this app is and finally i found that it was from taiwan so i became so happy and installed it.;1
This is really very good app. I would be happy if it notifies us after completion of the time;1
Nice concept, nicely designed but the graphics could have been better.;1
Great app, very helpful and super productive.;1
It should have an option which gives no time range, and one can on and off the timer as per his requirement and accordingly trees are planted.;1
So far I really enjoy this app. I would love more trees and flowers that grow with the longer focus time like how the pine does.;1
Great app. The only issue is that the app doesn't open after the first day.;1
I can't access to my account since the last update and I paid premium, what's happening?;1
I really love this app,specially the different sounds are in this app was too good,I think this is the best study app 😊😊;1
I love how this works, but maybe increase the amount of coins you get.;1
Great and awesome app for a student who wants to study but is distracted.✌👍👌;1
Why is not any option to silence the notifications while planting the seed so that we don't get distracted in between if someone messages us?;1
Wooowwww😚 it's really very cool app..✌️ I like this...I m able to focus on my studies with its help💛...it really a time consuming app💖😍....thnxxxx q forest for helping me from distraction 🤗🤗;1
This app is nice. Helps me to concentrate on my work.😃;1
Very nice app but there's no notification after finishing the time.;1
Very usefull app .. if u get distracted from your phone , u should use this app .. it is very easy to use , simple and interesting...;1
Everything about the apps is great except that in order to have just an account you need to pay;1
Thanks for fixing the problem. I've been using it efficiently now. It helps me to be consistent and productive during this lockdown:);1
Good;1
Everything is great seriously there's nothing to complain. But there's one thing, which until one gets to know is not an issue. When the app is run in the background in deep focus mode it's all good but if it is remove manuall from all tabs in background then any app can be accessed which wasn't allowed earlier. And the most annoying thing is that the plant still grows on without being withered. Please can some updates be made to fix this problem or there's way out, please let me know.;1
I love it. I'm like playing a game w/o using my phone but if you think about it, I'm actually playing a game using my phone!;1
not mutch. but does the job;1
Not bad;1
I think its a great app, however, i came to this appexpecting a whitelist, wich i didnt get because i have to pay it. This made the app so much worse, if im using my tablet, i need to make work profile abailable to use in order to be in my classes. I can ask if you can add the option to watch an ad to select whitelist, that would definately be a 5☆!;1
This app is helpful 👍 😀 but should have some more section like tasks or something for students;1
It's really nice. I want to upgrade to premium. My language is set to English but options during upgrading are set in Chinese. I don't understand it. So i can't continue with the upgrade. Can you assist me how? Thank you...;1
I really like the app, love my forest and stay at a higher level of concentration. But I apparently reached the limit of real-trees, which is only 5 and way too low! Otherwise a 5 Star experience!;1
Good app....please add another nature tones for the update...;1
It's an interesting app ! Try this app To focus on your goals in more interesting and more fun way . By the way , trying this app for the first time !;1
Fine..;1
Cool;1
Good, free coral;1
Im loving this app But sometimes it shows 'forest stopped working' please fix the issue😕;1
Cute and creative tree designs, simple interface and easy to use.;1
I have been using this app, this is just one gorgeous 'stay focused ' app, but at times when I want the app to open it shows stopped and I have to reinstall.;1
Relaxing after the use;1
Very good efforts Everyone who want to focus in their life, make their time more productive should definately download this app. It is very helpful. BUT the only bad thing about this app is that it requires money to create an account. See, users always seek to things or features that they can get for free. I think making the creation of an account free would help your app to spread amongst people.;1
Aplicativo top. Mas por favor, adicionem mais cores. A quantidade limitada me atrapalha. Abraços;1
Very usefull app .. if u get distracted from your phone , u should use this app .. it is very easy to use , simple and interesting...;1
Good app;1
i am now so addicted to this app, since the last update the app is not opening only on my Samsung phone. I don't want uninstall and then install it or i will loose all my progress. what do i do?;1
Serve it's purpose, but it can be run in background which should be neglect the whole Idea of note using Phone when focusing on other things;1
It gives good positive feedback by growing a forest and seeing it grow as you stay focused;1
It's great but I need more clear instructions.;1
Good;1
Love this app;1
It's a very good app that help you stay focous . It definitely worth a try.;1
Just got it. It says i have to be a pro version user to enable the setting shere if I close the app it effects the trees. I think its called Extremely Focused or sometning along those lines. It seems to be challenging to find this option to get the pro version. any help?;1
Ignore battery optimization is always turning off automatically without using the app for long time;1
Amazing app for improving productivity;1
Good;1
fun!;1
Good but I think there should be a section for important dates for free users;1
I am starting my journey. Today is my first day. After few days I will tell what's there in my heart;1
Its actually gd..but u should increse the forest facilities n dimension by that itll be more fun to use as well as to focus.;1
It's a very great app, really good one,it's motivating and you just addict yourself to your work just to collect the coins and open other features.I really appreciate the way it's constructed and definitely recommend it. But the reason I reduced one star is because you didn't add the screen rotate feature. Please do add because I really need it due to some problem.I love this app and that's why I really need that screen rotate on. Please,I request you to do it and I'm really happy the features🙂;1
If you want to be productive;1
Ok;1
Really nice app, the older version with the display on the lock screen showing countdown was useful.. please bring that back.;1
Great app;1
"The app is highly recommended and one of the popular ones. But after trying many other apps, it can use more features than just ""plant trees"" as reward and blocking mode. Plus most items in the shop cost a lot of coins, which means you have limited resources to decorate your forest with a free account. So the app will get boring to most of the free users after some time. The app is good, but it should upgrade to more exciting features (like daily plans, cheap shop items, etc) for free users.";1
Really good app;1
How to use whitelist;1
Good one;1
Its not showing my forest i reinstalled the app multiple times...can u please help?;1
Good;1
Great app, very helpful and super productive.;1
อยากให้มีจับเวลาไปเรื่อยๆได้ หยุดอ่านตอนไหนค่อยหยุดเพราะบางครั้งก็ไม่สามารถกำหนดเวลาอ่านได้แต่อยากรู้ว่าอ่านไปกี่ชั่วโมงแล้ว;1
Great but you make the forest more rewarding.;1
This app is nice. Helps me to concentrate on my work.😃;1
It's a great app for staying away from the phone while attending to one's tasks. As not all tasks are born equal, I'd really like to see taller trees for longer focus periods. It would be rewarding, plus the forest would look nicer and unique based on one's day;1
Pretty Good. Just the shop Items are really expensive and takes alot of time to actually get one.;1
When my phone is ringing, although I didn't answer,my tree is killed,what should I do???also voice call or video call in what s app cause the kill the trees;1
I enjoy the app but for some reason the end noise once my trees are planted no longer happens apart from that I enjoy the reward of planting for tasks a d seeing the results;1
nice app but the free version is really limited. should allow at least 1-2 apps for whitelist, and more in premium. I just want to be able to jot notes/thoughts, that's it.;1
This is a good thing to have;1
It's a good app but when I have entered in this app after some weak it automatically get close;1
Should be available in landscape mode too;1
I like it very much but its should be free i mean the pro thing;1
Good;1
Nice game but it makes me feel like l have FOMO on my favourite apps 😒😒😒😒😒😟😟😟🙁🙁🙁☹☹☹;1
This app is really beneficial specialy for studying. Please add more music with higher quality. Or s.th new to buy.;1
The app is just awesome now. Thank you seekrtech for fixing the bugs;1
App s not opening...its vry hard to uninstal .. and instal again..plz fix tis prblm..otherwise app s too gud...;1
Love the way they keep updating new species of tree , keeps u motivated and kind of provides satisfaction at the end of the day ,;1
เป็นapp ที่ทำให้มีสมาธิในการอ่านหนังสือมากขึ้นแต่แอพเด้งบ่อย อยากให้ปรับปรุงและพัฒนาต่อนะคะ;1
It's a good app, keeps you focused, you can buy different trees, But recently, I've developed a problem with it and I can't buy any more trees. When I try to, it glitches out :( so I'm stuck with 10 thousand coins but I can't buy anything with it Edit : that problem is fixed. Thank you !;1
Wonderful app...love it;1
Great app! But something about the Pro ver...can you make it like a bit cheaper cuz I'm a malaysian and the cost is a little high for me to purchase it;1
Nice well done;1
Great and awesome app for a student who wants to study but is distracted.✌👍👌;1
I can't obligate myself to study because with the free version you can leave but that help me do my work and when I will have to work again (school) I will be able to do it without it.;1
Nice experience .this app more valuable in my study timing concetration.;1
Have been enjoying using this. Helped in many ways. I would love to see auto planting the next forest after a configurable break. Those things would be a great add to the app;1
Gut😊;1
Works fine, but the free version is missing quite a few features. If you wish to use it you will need to pay for it, which is fair as it supports the developers!;1
Can you add more trees like wisteria or maple trees which look more real in next update. Please. It's very good tracker and my study hours has also been increased.;1
I can't access to my account since the last update and I paid premium, what's happening?;1
It would be perfect if it have website i can browse on my notebook;1
The best friend & application!I always study with forest❤;1
Hello I really love this app. I wanted to add a small suggestion. Most of the classes and study tools I attend are pre recorded video classes which are not allowed on laptop etc for copyright and privacy purposes. These can only be accessed via phone. So if there is an option to add just one app that can be accessed during the planting, that'd be brilliant since we can study online while avoiding other distractions. Thank you;1
Its A very helpful app .in your life.;1
This app is surprisingly helpful in stopping you from using your phone. The fact that the more coins spent on the app will plant more real trees making it extra fun.;1
This app is amazing except for one problem. When I got the premium version, most of my progress was erased! I'm glad some of it remained, but I worked for so long on that! Can you do something to fix that? Thanks.;1
"my review used to be 5-star, and I wrote a whole darn paragraph about how amazing forest was. it still is ! however, whenever I enter the app, the app immediately kicks me out !! please fix this, I've tried reporting a problem but it's been days and I haven't gotten back from anyone and the problem is still not fixed !! I would really love to give forest 5-stars again so please fix this, I love forest :"") update: tried uninstalling and installing the app, still no change !! :((";1
Wooowwww😚 it's really very cool app..✌️ I like this...I m able to focus on my studies with its help💛...it really a time consuming app💖😍....thnxxxx q forest for helping me from distraction 🤗🤗;1
Love this app! However I have one request. I want to be able to set a tag before I plant a tree, otherwise I have to update it all the time after the tree has grown. I'm not sure if there's already a way to do this.;1
"A good app for tracking productivity, but that's all it does. I think it needs to provide a bit more motivation to do those high focus tasks. So far the only ""reward"" is a few points which we can save but it might as well not be there because its so low. The purchasable items are over 2000 points, which will take a long time to save. So the app does get a bit boring after a while. That being said its still good for its primary function as being a ""tracker"". But I think it can be way more.";1
Good for those who read offline but not for those who have online studying platform.;1
It's fun;1
Great concept, but I only gave 4 stars because I would have to buy the premium version to be able to use other apps along with the Forest app. There are many different scenarios I would need to use another app. For example, I may need to use my calculator for my math homework or I will oftentimes use my phone for references while I draw. It's much harder to focus when I can't use the resources on my phone while I use this app. I love the idea of the app, but I really need that one feature.;1
Hello, as I updated the app to the latest version I could not open the in-app store to check out for the newer trees and sounds. When I clicked on the store the app automatically logged me out of it. I refreshed my phone a number of times and it still happens, I assume it is some bug? Please acknowledge this and fix it. Thank you.;1
Crashes on opening the store. Please fix it.;1
I really enjoy using this. Sadly I couldn't find The Cake Tree..though I updated the app. 😣;1
I took a star off b/c the alarm for reaching a goal has never worked for me( over 6 months) love the concept of planting real trees. It's not very different from a timer but it does let you keep track of progress in different areas if you use all the features like tags or different trees. I would love if I could see the progress while the tree is growing more visually so I feel like I am making progress but that's mostly b/c my timers are usually set for 2hrs.;1
"I purchased the premium version over an year ago and I can say that it's really worth it. Of course, you can use it for free but this app really helped me when I needed focus (before an important exam) so I've got the premium version more like a ""thanks"". I love that I can sync my phone with my laptop. What I don't like is that sometimes my trees die without a reason (it's really annoying). Anyway, great app! You have my respect!";1
I do not have the premium version, but this app is great for helping me with my procrastination by setting goals with rewards, which in my case is decorating my forest, and helping me live up to them and not quit. It helps me set a goal at the start, and Ali's FINISH it and not get distracted or give up halfway.;1
"I'm so happy that I found this app , I've been having problems sleeping at night and for months I couldn't sleep finally I searched up ""Calming"" and this came up , at first I was like ""ugh it's not gonna help"" but now I am so thankful I found this app it's so smoothing and I can grow my trees and listen to calming music! So I fall asleep and my trees grow! Thank you so much for making this all , I love that you can turn off your phone and the app continues to grow my trees and play music!🌳🌲";1
I love this app. It really helped me a lot to focus on my studies. I actually used to get distracted very easily with the mobile notifications and had an urge to check those, but this app prevented me from doing all those and completely focus on my works. It also motivated me to complete my works faster. This app is brilliant in my opinion;1
Man, it's amazing.. It's a kind of tme management app which is made lika a game. It's quite easy to use. I just have one.... issue. Inam a free user amd I notice that almost all of the options are only available for premium users. So, kindly make at least one of the options (like tags, real forest, etc.) free. Thanks!;1
I absolutely love this!! I love using the deep focus mode often and it keeps me from getting distracted on the phone. I love the concept of growing trees and your own forest—in a way, it feels like a game, and that's really lovely! I also like all the different sounds that they offer. They put me in a study mode and is really useful.;1
It really helps me save my time for more important things and it's also fun because you can look forward to the coins and trees. However, I bought the pro subscription so I can set my allow list but isn't working well I even tried turning everything on but it still disabled some apps and paused music on YouTube music though it didn't block the app. Another one is that the new exclusive trees in the shop cost too much. I was willing to get them if I could get all for around ¥500~1000;1
I love it, and it works sooo well.. I have adhd and im VERY easily distracted.. This kind of gives me a sense purpose when planting little trees.. And oooh my goodness, its sooo sad seeing them die and wither away 😓😢. And the cute little island with all your previous trees is super rewarding to see. Like yea.. I did that.. UwU..;1
Very helpful app... I used to follow the 25 - 5 rule by using the timer in my phone... But it was time consuming and very very boring... Happy I found this app at the right time....😄😄 Can you please add a thing to the app? When I use deep focus mode I would need a app to run to study.... So give permission for one app to run even in deep focus mode please.... I would love it to be added...😄;1
Love this app. Simple yet effective. And I think for most users a upgrade would not be required. Though you can use pro after you have spent a lot of time with it. In a way to give back to the community.And to new users I would say that you should watch that little ad because it's going to take a long time to buy trees.;1
2019: 1 star This app was very good with helping me not use my phone... but every time I switch my phone back on it doesn't work.. please work on this as I really liked the app. Edited: July 21, 2020 Whatever issue this app had has been sorted I believe and it seems to be working now. Love love LOVE forest;1
The app is just too good. Has helped me a lot to focus. No complaints when it comes to the concept, I even bought the pro version. But the app keeps crashing, which forces me to keep uninstalling and installing almost every 3 days. It becomes very annoying.;1
Update: Thanks for the fast response! I have a suggestion: I find it very tempting to turn deep focus off all the time. As I am not very intrested in the leaderboard, it would be really helpful if turning deep focus off would affect my coins instead. Tnx! :);1
This is the reason I get straight A's I'm continuing with my studies and doing well in these times.The only problem I have is that once you get use to the rain sounds make focus it takes a WHILE to get use to another sound but in conclusion I really LOVE this app ❤️;1
Only day one but WOW. It's dumb how distracted we get from our phones. This has kept me focused for 45min study sessions during they day, with 30 min breaks. The material I'm studying is so dry so this really helps. If it keeps working I'll upgrade to premium. Also downloaded the night version. Keep up the good work!!!;1
At first I didn't know why this app had such a high rating but now after downloading and using it, it had helped so much on my studying time! I really reccomend this, it'll really help out those who had troubles in staying focus!!;1
Only thing that does the trick. Keeps me focused and off my phone when i need to work but also keeps me off my phone at night when i need to sleep! I adore the tree varieties and motivation to plant real life trees. Absolutely 0 complaints from me, very happy customer. :);1
I have been using this application since almost three years now, tried many other 'productivity' applications during this time, but keep coming back to this one! Love it for its simplicity, esthetic appeal! 🙌;1
It rly helps to lock ur phone so that u can stay focus. I think this premium is really worth it. Around $3 for forever premium! Different species help to motivates me to study because i want a variety of different trees so my forest dont look so dull. So how to get different trees? Study and earn coins!! Really love this app alot. I never regretted paying for premium. Keep it up!!;1
It's easy on the eyes. Simple interface and it keeps track of my habits. I've used it before and I just got backt to it again in hopes of syncing it with my tablet.;1
Very good app. It helps me a lot and it is very addictive as well. It will help you a lot for focusing and get your things done.. purely and truly satisfied 🤗;1
This is perfect. Recently switched to pro version. Totally worth it :) Please add an alarm system when the tree is successfully planted. This will help people who follow pomodoro techniques like me.;1
When you update the app, it stops working and you lose all the trees planted. I reinstalled and again it stopped working. The developer should look into this.;1
Last time I rated the app because there was an issue with the opening . But now it is fixed , I am very happy to say that this app very nice to use and manage.;1
Omg, at first I was litteraly confused how to control myself on social media and my studies. But Now I have this app.. whenever I start its time. And then in a minute, like *I want to look my instagram... and my friends post... Actors post.. VSCO... whats hapening in todys world? * I want it really really bad.. and as you see I spent my time mostly in my social media. Than my studies. And its not good for me. But then I saw this forest, and it changed my Life.;1
"Love this app The thing that I loved the most about this app that shows the word ""GIVE UP"" instead of ""CANCEL"" or any other arbitrary word , which makes you feel guilty when you intend to turn off the timer.";1
Super helpful for keeping me focused and studying, the drive to not want to kill a tree I've started is surprisingly strong - keeping me off my phone! Nice flexible functions to tailor to what I need and options for sounds.;1
I came across Forest while looking through simulation games, and like the 'leave your phone alone' angle. Motivational messages display as the timer runs, and if you're doing something where you're going to be away from your phone anyway, why not set the timer and plant a tree? You can double your earned coins by watching an ad. Other than that, as are very minimal. It's a focus game, after all.;1
I love this, it has legitimately helped my focus and productivity a ton during this pandemic. I had a lot of trouble focusing at home when my college went online, but this is simple, clear, pretty, and very satisfying. The free version has all I needed but I upgraded just to support the people who made this. I use this daily, even months later. I've recommended it to family, and I'd recommend it to anyone who needs some help staying motivated and focused during all this!;1
Very helpful in staying focused on a work. I mainly use this during studying to stay focused and to track the amount of time I have spend. Is a wonderful app.;1
My productivity has increased ×10 times just because of this app. Now not only can I stay focused and not get distracted by my phone but also keep a track of my time spent and my daily,weekly,monthly or yearly productivity. One suggestion though, please try new features like scheduling and other such features. I love this app!❤😍;1
Please add in a pause button, so that if any unpredicted action comes over, that doesn't distract the focus time.;1
Loving it. It helps me focus on tasks and get on with work. I use it to revise and when writing;1
This app is awesome, only thing I wanted was to be able to pause the timer but even with out that feature it is brilliant;1
I love this app! I'm always motivated by gamifying things, and this is pure fun. While the app seems to focus on less screen time, I'm using it as a Pomodoro Timer for focusing on the things I want to get done, like writing time. It's great fun and I have the pro version. I can highly recommend it!;1
Very lovely app. Timer + statistics + it's beautiful. Don't care much about else. It just works;1
Great app! Optimally used if you're also away from other sources of distraction (people, TV, computer, etc). My only gripe is that I wish there was a silent notification that either vibrated or lit up my phone to let me know my study session is over so I can take a break. Sometimes I forget to check my phone!;1
Honestly, one of the most brilliant apps to use if you need help focusing on work. You'll not regret using this app!!!;1
A very good app for people who can't focus and have background noise Pro tip - When set the timer plug in the earphones and onn the sound ❤ Loved it;1
This is a fabulous app! It helped me to stay focused when I had to work on my online homework. Now that I'm stuck at home because of quarantine, Forest helps me to concentrate on my work instead of all the distractions around me, like my phone. I love the sounds on the app like rain and birds chirping, and I like how it can let you play your own music too. It was very helpful for studying, and helped me to stay off my phone. 5/5!;1
I love the minimalistic design of this app. Focusing and buying new tree species, deep focus mode, planting real trees, daily/weekly forest, etc. A these features are motivating to keep working. It doesn't have any annoying unnecessary features. I really love the tree species and for me that's probably one of the coolest parts cause I get to plant specific trees for each activity and look at my forest. I don't keep many apps but this is one of the best apps I've ever had. Will always keep it.;1
"Great app! Pro mode is well worth it for the Allowlist mode if you're like me and can't keep your grubby little hands off your phone. Also, kudos to Forest for changing the app's ""Whitelist"" and ""Blacklist"" modes to ""Allowlist"" and ""Blocklist"" in the wake of the George Floyd protests and BLM movement. It's a subtle change, but it sets a very important example that I hope others follow.";1
This app has been an absolute lifesaver since having to work at home. I dont use it every day but there are some days where it's been too easy to get sucked in to my phone and starting this is usually enough to get me focused back on work so I only have to use it once or twice. It would be nice if it had an option to keep upgrading your tree if you keep focusing longer than your timer. I tend to set mine to 10 minutes every time because a timer going up works better for me than one going down.;1
I love this app. There could only be one checklist option, it would be perfect! ❤️;1
Perfect works but please add more hours to focus because 3 hours is too short for me. And add Indonesia language.;1
I tried hundreds of apps and thousands of ways for being focused, nut nothing helped me then I found this app and I am staying focused. This is the best one.;1
Edit: Thanks Forest team for fixing this bug! I give you back the 5 stars! Been using it for around two years, always liked it until a new update recently where it does not notify me anymore when the focus period ends. It would be better to put the feature back in to help users maintain mental energy sustainably.;1
Really cool app. Helps you focus if you are always on your phone/ screens. You can plant a virtual tree and if you go on an app it dies. All the trees you plant are put in your personal forest. The more you concentrate the more coins you get and your can buy sounds and different trees. If you pay you can use your coins to plant trees in the real world. I highly recommend this app to anyone.;1
Amazing app to help you complete focused work without falling into distractions. You plant virtual trees and get coins when they grow up. You can accumulate the coins and exchange them for either new types of virtual trees or to plant ACTUAL ones. So, not only it helps you in being more productive. But also, it lets you contribute to the environment.;1
I expected that the more one would stay focused, the more trees would add up to my garden giving rise to forest. That would have been really cool. If this feature is added, surely this app deserves 5 stars because it's simple and easy to use. You don't want a productivity app to do complicated itself that it takes more time from you than you want to save.;1
Really great. You get coins when you grow trees (the more time you study for the more coins you get) and with the coins, you can buy different white noises for when you focus, and different types of trees. I use it to study at home and it feels really rewarding and disciplined. Also it's really cool watching your tree grow as you work! :);1
"First read of this app in the book ""In-distract-able"" as I was struggling to focus my time working from home. It's such a basic tool for motivation but the simplicity is what makes it so great. Especially good for those who like the idea of growing virtual forests and having visual feedback to how productive you've been!";1
This app is fairly effective at gamifying my approach to staying focused. They have also taken care with features to make my user experience smooth and return control to me. I went ahead and purchased for some of the additional features because the price was very reasonable for the continued work they are putting in. One thing I think would be great if they could keep it as minimal and simple as the rest of the app is to let me customize self tracking that I have to do with the tagging.;1
"I love how you are able to gamify something as ""boring"" as being present, productive and focused into something so fun, altruistic and interesting as creating your own forest. Thank you for this app.";1
a cute and fun way to help you focus and track your records.;1
Best app ever ..... i have used .... i was not able to focus but it motivates me .... and im happier than ever .... it rewards me a tree for my whole focus.... and it works extremely well . In my view its the best app for students who think that they have sitting but lack focus.... i hope this works always the same ... i'm having regards for the team who created this app.... thank u so much.....;1
This is a great app. I would definitely recommend this app. It helps to study and not get distracted because of your phone and this is something fun like it is an app for productivity but is like a game. Although there are some options with which we can get out of the app and use our phone but this app just makes me want to study and not cheat to use the phone. I love this app. This app does not even force you to rate it I am writing this long review for the first time. I definitely love it 😍;1
I have to reinstall it everytime, because it is not opening sometimes. And sometimes it starts responding in some other languages and can't login to my premium account. All these happens after i bought the premium version. This is such a helpful app. So i hve no other choice than reinstalling it everytime. Please fix this...! I need this app...!!;1
Best! experienced real improvement in focused time. , Highly recommended for study and focused work.;1
but it keeps crashing in the middle of a sessio . also i keep having problems when logging in. so i only fix it by uninstalling and reinstalling it 😞 please fix this bug.- previous review i did send my problem to your app platform and apparently i just have to disable auto update from both playstore and the appstore of oppo. thank you!;1
Just I love it. I don't know this app. Once I open YouTube and see what is the best apps for student. And it tells 10 apps. But I can try only this app. So it will be very helpful, greatful, joyful and totally it suits me. It is very helpful for all. Your's, Deepika;1
No complain just amazing! But I want to see more features like to create an automated pomodoro type session where I set the planting time & break time and it will go off automatically when I start. There will be definite sessions like 30 min with 4 sessions and 5 min interval in each sessions. So I don't have to set the planting time nor break time everytime I finish planting a tree. Also it would be nice to have to do task list with planting session.;1
Yeah i love this app. Inspired by the idea. Try planting a tree when you are havings stuffs to do, but you seem to be wasting time scrolling. That would be the real way of utilizing the app. And youve got different trees to grow :). Kudos to the creator.;1
If you are struggling to become productive and cant get any work done then this is a good choice! Make sure you write down what all things you need to complete on a specific day set a timer for eg...1 hour or according to your convenience how much time it will take to complete that task and complete it and you wont be able to use your phone which will prevent you from procrastinating!;1
I don't know why but the satisfaction of planting a fictional tree successfully is so addicting! And it's a good thing because while it's growing, i actually do something productive. Cheating while the tree is growing just doesn't feel right therefore, to my surprise, finished so many tasks i was due. Today i woke up and i had this urge to plant a fictional tree and get to work. This never in my life happened before! Truly the best app and i strongly recommend you to use it from today, daily!;1
I love this app,helps me a lot in focusing :) btw(not related to my review)when I was playing forest rain sound coincidentally it started raining🌧️;1
This app is perfect for students and for doing work in general it helps me focus and stay away from social Media apps so that I don't get distracted from studying;1
"I liked this app....also the way it has organised and even it helps a lot ...not only in study also in other work and i like this appp....happy to install it..... ☺☺☺☺....";1
Beautiful, easy to use, not too bad on storage space or battery usage, and definitely effective! It leaves encouraging (or sassy XD) little messages to help you focus and stay off your phone. I definitely recommend this to anyone who has trouble staying on task or who gets easily distracted, like me lol;1
Great app to keep you focused on the tasks at hand. The minimum time that I could set to grow the tree is only 10 minutes. Wish the minimum was for 5 minutes. Great app and the pro version is only $5. That money is really worth the spend.;1
The perfect app for procrastination for my school work. Instead of just blocking apps from your phone like similar apps to forest, everytime you complete your work you feel rewarded through growing a tree. I had an issue with the pro version on my device but this was quickly resolved through contacting the developers. All around very satisfied with this app.;1
This app is perfect for getting work done and is a great way to keep track of progress!;1
Wonderful app to stay focused and feel productive. Even if you didn't get your task done in the time window, you have a great little tree! You can put yourself in deep focus mode which kills your tree when you leave the app, which is awesome for keeping off social media and mindless browsing.;1
Keeps me on task. I get easily distracted. I live phone games. I needed something to keep me off social media and off my phone while working. This is awesome because I still get to play a game while not allowing myself to be distracted for a certain period of time.;1
this app is great for focusing and studying. and i will definitely recommend it to a friend. but theres a problem: i understand it blocks other apps to avoid distraction like google and youtube. but you must aslo kno some of us use google to do researches so please have options on which apps to block. thank you;1
It's a fabulous app for focused concentration onto a task. It's smooth and has everything you may ask for. The background music theme is pretty nice. App crashed way too frequently earlier, there was an issue with a phone makers update. Resolved .;1
Really helps me stay focused. I tried out many apps but this one works best for me.;1
Love this app! Without this running, I am constantly picking up my phone when I should be working. But this helps keep me focused on my work. Plus I love growing all the little plants, and seeing how many I can get in one day!;1
This app is very good since I love nature and doing things involving nature, at school, =￣ω￣= I Raye this 5/5 since its a great app that helps me with tine management ︶w︶ *Thumbs up* This app also gives calming audios that makes me focus on my work better... I also found this app from NataliesOutlet! She is the best too! UwU Thx for this amazing and super wonderful app! ☜☆☞◌⑅●♡⋆♡LOVE♡⋆♡●⑅◌;1
I like this app because it helps me staying focus when I'm studying, doing chores, reading or speaking with friends. We are so attached to our cellphones that sometimes it's difficult to stop looking at it so it helps tricking yourself to believe you received some kind of reward.;1
This app helps me to stay focused. And it's really convenient since there's a background music you could play. Having something to look forward to after you finished studying/working is really rewarding, the trees are a great help.;1
Its a very good app . It helps me stay focused . I like the features of this app . It is very easy to use . One feature which I personally love about this app is that we cannot exit this app until we are done with our work but if we did that that our tree will die . It also helps me stay productive . 👍👍👍;1
Hi Forest dev team. I wanted to thank you for creating such an awesome app. The only problem with the application that i can use any app() without killing the tree by just clearing the forest app from recent app list/overview. In other words, U can cheat the app. Suggestions>>> 1. Either disable the recent app list/overview. 2. Or, kill the tree if a user clear forest app from overview/recent app list. Thank you;1
It is kind of motivating to not leave what you are doing. For instance, the message displayed everytime I unlock my phone during a planting, makes me realise how many times I am tempted to leave it and if it was really a tree it would have not been able to grow with this attitude. I return to my work believing I am adding something each passing moment to my goal.;1
App wasn't working earlier in my phone due to some settings. They responded quickly and the app works fine now. This is really the best productivity app there is. It not only helps you to stay off your phone but also motivates you to be more productive in order to grow your forest. If you can afford, do buy the premium version because then you can plant real trees and there is nothing better than that!;1
The app kept crashing but i reached out to the support and they helped and fixed the problem;1
Love this app, bought the Premium (so worth it!) Helps me be productive and keep track on how I spend my time. It's more fun joining timed sessions with other Forest users;1
I love this app !!! I get distracted a lot so this really helps stay on track also the design is really cute and it's just good. I didn't pay for the premium but you still get a lot out of it;1
It's really fun and rewarding to see my trees being planted and grown in the forest whenever I finish the focus timer. This app has helped me get through some of the more dreaded block study periods in my school life, and continues to help me stay focused whenever I should and need to be.;1
It's great for me, gives me the motivation to stay off my phone not just for studying but also being active. Best phone detox! I really love the concept of buying trees and shrubs too. A game for lazy tappers I guess 😂✨;1
Edit :wasn t able to choose anything from store but now i m able to unlock trees and sounds again. Could it be battery optimization settings that bugged me? Thank you so much :) I used the app for 7hrs yesterday I couldn't believe I left my phone for 7hrs!!!;1
This app really draws my attention. Forest not only sends out meaningful messages (protect the green environment and save the future), but it is also a friendly reminder for me of staying focused on study and work, instead of being distracted.;1
I've never had a problem with this app, and it really does help me to be focused on whatever I'm doing.;1
Thank you. Great work, thanks for fixing the isshe I was facing.. Great developer;1
Great little app! Love the sounds, in particular cafe Paris. I did have some issues- twice had to reboot, once because the sound wouldn't stop, and once because it never stopped bringing me back to the app. But all in all a great app.;1
I have just found out about this app. I just love it the thought of contributing to trees and sudden reminders about not killing them is not for the faint hearted. I persevered and won some coral. Just delightful the sound of the rainforest is a wonderful calming touch. Smashing 🌳;1
Great focusing app! Love seeing my progress on the forest map!;1
Wonderful app. Super productive. Work gets done easier. Faster;1
Just awesome!;1
Very helpful and fun to use.This is the best focused app for students.;1
Wonderful application, thank you.;1
It's amazing;1
I'm a huge procrastinator! My problem is usually starting my assignments. This app is great! You can leave ur music playing and just focus on your work;1
Slowly but Steadily improve my performance and productivity on learning. Keep all us excited with more features, thank you.;1
First, this app amazing ....i raly appreciate this...so i enjoyed this...it's very useful to manage my time productively ...i love this app🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩;1

Awesome app. It really helps me keep my focus. There are ads but the app is well worth them.;1
Usefull app;1

Love the reward system with the trees being planted etc. Really helps me stay on task and very user friendly!;1
Well done for making this app. This is such a great idea to finish the task, homework and all focusing things to do without distracted. Thanks for the maker of this application.;1
Love it tq;1
Good game;1
Thanks to this app, i can be more focus now on my studies.;1

Best app I ever have;1
Awesome app for self motivation;1
Wonderful!;1
This is the reason I get straight A's I'm continuing with my studies and doing well in these times.The only problem I have is that once you get use to the rain sounds make focus it takes a WHILE to get use to another sound but in conclusion I really LOVE this app ❤️;1
Whoooo.NOT BAD.ITS VERY NICE;1
I do not have the premium version, but this app is great for helping me with my procrastination by setting goals with rewards, which in my case is decorating my forest, and helping me live up to them and not quit. It helps me set a goal at the start, and Ali's FINISH it and not get distracted or give up halfway.;1
Excellent;1
Good app for focusing on studies and staying away from phone;1
It has helped me to increase my study time from 1to 3 hours in one study lap;1
So good;1
Fa quello che deve in modo super personale e inusuale.;1
Tbh I love this, IDK why!!! Thanks developers;1
It is great, now I can be focussed because I care about my little make belive forest...;1
Nice app for study thanks;1
This is perfect. Recently switched to pro version. Totally worth it :) Please add an alarm system when the tree is successfully planted. This will help people who follow pomodoro techniques like me.;1
Perfect works but please add more hours to focus because 3 hours is too short for me. And add Indonesia language.;1
Best app for focusing;1
It's awesome app;1
a cute and fun way to help you focus and track your records.;1
Helps me focus a lot!;1
Perfect;1
I've never had a problem with this app, and it really does help me to be focused on whatever I'm doing.;1
GREAT APP HELP ME DURING QUARANTINE SO MUCH.;1
Great for focusing;1
100% Good and Productive App For Indian 🇮🇳 And Love Taiwan not China;1
Great for studying and getting away from phone.;1
Best productivity app. I am, being a miser Indian , still bought the premium version. It is so good worth every paisa;1
Loved it;1
This is the best focus time ever 😭💜;1
Very effective, however for the past few weeks (maybe months), the countdown timer continues despite opening apps out of my whitelist.;1
This app is very amazing it keeps focused;1
good app;1
Good app;1
Helps me focus.;1
I love it. Useful and cute!;1
Great for tracking your productivity and gives you a dopamine hit/reward (Trees) for being productive;1
Perfect app for phd student who has smart phone and need focus in his/her studies.;1
The best app ever.;1
Wow i love this app!!!;1
Amazing app..it helps me to concentrate on my work and get rid of my mobile during study time;1
Last time I rated the app because there was an issue with the opening . But now it is fixed , I am very happy to say that this app very nice to use and manage.;1
Great app to stay focused on work and study tasks;1
Its very useful;1
bagus;1
Best app to maintain focused;1
Very helpful app to keep up your productivity;1
100% recommended, best app of this kind;1
Es una app que motiva a la productividad, tiene bonitos árboles y vale la pena comprar su extensión de paga :);1
I just love this app.It help us to stay focused in our work. 😘;1
A very nice app really reccomend;1
This app is wow ❤;1
Love it really fresh idea;1
it s absolutely amazing. it helps me focus and i am motivated to grow trees in that time.;1
good;1
I like this app;1
Good;1
"I'm so happy that I found this app , I've been having problems sleeping at night and for months I couldn't sleep finally I searched up ""Calming"" and this came up , at first I was like ""ugh it's not gonna help"" but now I am so thankful I found this app it's so smoothing and I can grow my trees and listen to calming music! So I fall asleep and my trees grow! Thank you so much for making this all , I love that you can turn off your phone and the app continues to grow my trees and play music!🌳🌲";1
Amazing;1
Great!!!;1
Good;1
it's a great app;1
I somehow feel bad about killing trees even though they aren't actually real! This app is a great way to keep yourself focused.;1
Best app ever.....just wanted the premium version features for free as I can't afford it;1
Loved the App..... Wonderful....;1
One of the best app 👍;1
It's easy on the eyes. Simple interface and it keeps track of my habits. I've used it before and I just got backt to it again in hopes of syncing it with my tablet.;1
Really useful;1
Good one to focus and encourage environmental resonsibility;1
This helps me a lot to get motivated but i hope there's an option to log in thru facebook so that it is easy to find friends who use the app and plant together;1
Haven't tried it yet...;1
Its good☆;1
Do not use this app, lost all my data (something like 3 years) go ahead and read other have the same problems, I even have premium. Now its impossible to login back with FB or email. Really, really disapointed. Developers dont answer any emails.;0
Really liked the app and have been using premium but now I want to transfer to a new device. I can only doing this by signing up but whenever I go to the sign up section and type my email and password nothing happens and it asks me to sign up again. Really frustrating. If you guys can solve this it will definitely be 5 stars.;0
Very frustrated with this app. Was using it to track goals, paid for it so I could save data in preparation for switching. Setup new phone, try to login and FB login no longer works and email not recognized. Great app, not worth paying for at all.;0
Worst App. Requires premium membership to sync data even after signing up with Email. What's the use of signing up with Email if you cannot sync the data. It's just a calender without premium membership. Better to use default inbuilt calender app to track your progress than using this application. I've lost all my progress that I've been tracking from 300 days. Shittiest app ever.;0
[Privacy] Don't install this app. I purchased pro version [IAP] of this app in 2017. In 2018 dev mysteriously resets my account and when I contacted him, he gave me a password in plain text. So, he has my email address and password. I hope you understand that he has my data. I would urge you to switch to any open source app. Please care for your privacy.;0
Update: dropped 5 star rating to 1star. App will not sync. I have it on Android and iPad,and neither one of them will sync to the server. App store shows 8 months since any updates. Would not have paid for premium if I knew it wasn't going to be maintained. Original review: I wanted to make something like this myself, but they've already done a great job. I feel more obligated to the daily habits I'm trying to build, and it's great that it tracks my completion streaks.;0
*Update* 11/02/20 USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! As expected, no contact from developers. App has not been updated since 2018. This app was great for a month until it kept freezing my phone. A de/reinstall has now lost all my data and looking at other users with this issue, it looks like it is lost forever because of the sync function never working and no contact from developers. Very upset and disappointed.;0
I just bought premium and realized I made a mistake right away! It told me to register to sync my data and I did. Sync option wouldn't do anything. I wasn't able to set a username because of some unknown error all the time. Then half the screen was empty and I decided it was a glitch and reinstalled it and now ALL MY DATA IS GONE! So stupid! I just paid 10 bucks to be able to create more than 5 habits and I lost everything! Don't recommend this app, so disappointed...;0
I paid for habitbull premium for the sync functionality, which fully does not work. I've tried reinstalling the app, reinstalling android, getting a new phone. No luck. Emailed habitbull a month ago and still no reply. If I want to take a backup I have to screenshot everything. not ideal Apart from this the app is decent. It's got a cute meme;0
NOBODY USE THIS APP. Read all the forums. The app does not support the sync once you've bought premium. Everyone's saying the same. And the devs DO NOT RESPOND TO HELP REQUESTS. I have an error that makes me unable to sync due to a connection error though clearly I am connected to the internet. I am a premium user. The app is great but please help me with my problem. I'm tired of taking screenshots of all my pages every week as my remedy for the sync error.;0
Update 2020: sadly they didn't reach out to me despite me paying for premium version. Lost my account and no means of logging back in. Otherwise, the app is good especially the UI. Like this app but until recently I had to change phones and the database could not locate my email and the app changed names and logo so it's all confusing. If you could help me locate my account as I bought the premium version but couldnt log in to my account. Please help because I want to use this great app!;0
The app itself is great. I used it quite regularly a few years back but when I tried to use it again it seems that the 'new' owners don't acknowledge their 'lifetime' subscription. Sure hope my emails get more results besides ... /ignore kthnxbye Sent an email ... they said they opened a ticket and then ... crickets. Nice .. thanks, downgraded to;0
I have an error that makes me unable to sync due to a connection error though clearly I am connected to the internet. I am a premium user. The app is great but please help me with my problem. I'm tired of taking screenshots of all my pages every week as my remedy for the sync error.;0
"The idea behind the app is good. Although, after paying for premium, the promised cloud sync does not work (several users mention the same issue). There is no way of backup the data either. I cannot see any feedback from devs here. Switched to a different app: ""Habits.""";0
Decent, but premium features like Sync do not work, can't even reimport data you exported yourself. Had I realized this I would have never have bought the app, it's just false advertising. I now have to figure out how to port my data to another app where it won't be inevitably lost.;0
This app seemed to have all the features I wanted, but the sync did not work after I paid $10 for the sync feature. I emailed their support with no reply. Very bad customer service.;0
I have been using the app from the last 3 years. I am a premium user. When trying to sign in a new device and sync, it's not syncing. I need my data. please help with this issue. Even after reaching to the support team tonnes of times no one is responding. So i am changing the rating from 3 to 1.;0
"Don't install this app.This is forgery. I've used this app for more than 2 years when I changed my mobile phone I couldn't login when I logged in it says ""this email account is not in our database"" I have the mail to prove that I had had the account in the App.I mailed the company 4-5 times but there's no reply. 2 years of my habit data is lost.";0
"App was good in past but not anymore, it has stopped sync and many bugs creeped in due to no maintenance and update since. As per details in app Page, last update was on 28th Jun 2018, but still it is the first thing that comes in results when I search for ""Habit"" 😲 I guess Google should stop advertising an app that is not managed since years.";0
Does not allow tracking of more than 5 habits without upgrading. Unable to remove or hide features that are of no use to me. Do not recommend. Waste of time.;0
I have tried a lot to set up reminder..but unfortunately it's not working which is pretty excruciating as a new user. It seems good initially but this is pissing me off. Do ler me know I can fix up this ..;0
Worst app,, Now I just know that only 5 habit can track freely , there above premium, also payble Back up, But Developer are never inform first.....;0
Limited to 5 habits in the free trial. Waste of time. This is not a useful free trial for me. I have 7 things I'm tracking;0
The widget doesn't work properly. It only works when i open the app first and then go to widget again. Kindly fix this;0
Haven't been able to get a reply from customer support since August 2019 - if you can't get your email registered you can't use this across multiple devices. Super disappointed.;0
"2018-11-19 -it seems useful, but it crashes on my phone 3 - 15 times a day. 2019-04-13 - No update, this app would be great if it didn't crash just about every time I go to my home screen from *anywhere*. Also there have been no update, and no responses to the roughly 75 - 100 error logs that I have submitted. I paid $5.00 (US) for a ""life time subscription"" to the premium version. DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY !!!!!!";0
None of the reminders work, notifications turned, only when do I open the app do I get reminded of my activities;0
I paid for premium when transitioning to a new phone, and my history was transferred. I recently had to un+re-install the App for personal reasons and it does not recognise my account anymore. Creator contact has not responded to numerous courteous emails. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. Wish I could get 3+ years of data back. I loved the App, and the App itself is 5 stars but will only rate 1 due to reasons above. Would change to 5 stars if resolved.;0
Unrecoverably crashed, reinstalled. Then the data partially gone. Pretty disappointed. No response from the devs. In hindsight this is an app that haven't released for more than a year, so could have been expected. Data is not critical of course (bunch of date markers), but it feels like all those habits disappeared with the data :/;0
DO NOT PURCHASE! The app works as it's supposed to, with exception for the added purchase features. I bought the app so it could sync up with multiple devices, that feature does not work despite following the FAQ as to why it might not work. I have tried their support ticket system which had an automated response, but they have yet to respond despite me trying multiple times to reach them and ask for assistance or a refund.;0
The app hasn't synced for nearly 9 months despite being a premium user. The support team haven't acknowledged my email. It's a good concept but they've failed to make it work and don't provide customer support. Check other reviews. Go to play.google.store on a web browser. Select My Account and go to order history. Select the ... and it offers you an option to request a refund. That should get the developer to either repair it or take off the premium services it is falsely selling.;0
The Premium version of the App does not sync across multiple devices. I use an android phone and a chromebook and it still does not work. Don't bother with Premium.;0
"Updating my previous review. I recently hit the two year mark on one of my habits, yet the app only shows me of having 30 days. This is the same bug I reported last year. It appears that it does not recognize some of my habits over the New Year. I've reported this problem four times now and have never heard back from anyone. I'm giving up on this app, and suggest you do too. ""I've used this for a couple of years. There was a bug where one week of my tracking wasn't recognized by the app. This happened the week of New Years. I reached out to the developer five times about it and never heard back. Unfortunately, this has become an unreliable app for tracking.""";0
The app itself gets the job done, but it will not sync and the developer is not responsive to questions. Don't waste your money with premium. You won't get what you pay for.;0
Sync DOES NOT work! I've tried multiple times to get it to work and my internet connection is just fine. Had to switch phones when my old phone died and can't get my old data back on the app because sync doesn't work. Also no way to import data. Great app if the feature worked or could import data, but rendered useless because of this. So if I switch phones or have to reset to factory standards, I lose everything. Paid quite a bit for this app just for this feature alone, but it DOES NOT work.;0
"After purchase, sync is not working. Then y sholud I purchase this app. Profile name is empty, while editing it says ""something went wrong"". And app is completely crash now. Not at all opening.";0
Such a bad experience. I bought the app and now it says they can't find my email id in their database. I am trying to reach them for 4 days. No response. just automated mails. so pathetic.;0
This app would be great if they would just stop locking people out of premium. This has happened with several users for months and still not fixed. I got a new phone and can't use this app because login with Facebook won't transfer. This is my first one star review I ever gave an app and to say I am disappointed. Just use one of the many other habit trackers.;0
Many bugs: - Some deleted habits appears suddenly, combine with current ones - Some habits: successful days not linked each other. (I'm a premium user);0
Find a new app. Overall if you havent noticed, the dev's left this app. As of recently, the servers are dead. This means you cant make an account, forums are gone, motivation pictures gone, etc. Find a new app,;0
I bought the premium access and then when i change my phone, i never could get access to the premium version again... I wrote them an email 2 month ago and i havent received answers yet.;0
I purchased the app to make full use of it and add many habits with a reminder for each. But the reminder doesnt work at all. Initially for some habits it used to remind randomly but after a day of purchasing none of the reminders are working :( please solve my issue as i really wanted to use this app to its potential.;0
When it works it's great but after using it for a while and paying for the ability to export and sync data, all my data is gone. Every attempt to contact them goes unanswered and the last update was over a year ago. They're willing to take your money but not to update or support the software. Use this at your own risk.;0
"Good app, appallingly bad support. Paid for premium and enjoyed the app for 2 years. Old phone died now can't restore the data on the new phone. The ligin is not recognized. Noone replying to the emails. So much for ""premium""... Quick googling reveals many people experience the same... Frustrating";0
After installing this app my phone received an increased amount of spam calls. After removing the app from my phone I received fewer spam calls. It might be a coincidence... But it might not be.;0
This app claimed it was syncing to the cloud. When I lost everything on my phone and had to reinstall it, signed in, and tried to sync ... there was nothing. I have an open support case that nobody at Habitbull has responded to (#900271) Do not trust this app or whether it will backup your habit tracking data. Terrible customer service and fail of an app.;0
Paid for premium. Sync does not work. Publisher does not reply. Started reading reviews and found numerous people with the same problem. Going to try to get my money back. Nice app if you don't care about backups or syncing between devices or customer support. Switched to Goalify and finding them extremely responsive;0
App no longer supported, data loss likely: Was a great app until I needed to migrate to a new phone. The sync feature never worked, and I lost months of habit data. I tried contacting the developer via the supplied email, but zero response. I used to recommend this app to many people, but I'm done with it.;0
"Pathetic. I was totally in love with this app until I changed my phone. I lost the phone, and when I installed the app in my new phone, everything was gone. My habits, data for last one year, every damn thing. And I have purchased premium of the highest cost. There's no way to restore my data or contact the devs. If you cannot save on JSON file of mine in your cloud, please explain why I should buy premium? There is a sync option in the app. Don't tell me I should have manually ""synced"" my stuff";0
The problem I have is that if I set a habit to be every Monday and Wednesday, for example, and I follow it successfully for a few weeks. Then if I just want to change the days, it discards all my previous progress, which is stupid. I just changed the days and the app can't understand this.;0
It's a great app, used it for over a year happily. Even paid for it. Recently had to switch phones and when I reinstalled on my new phone the sync function doesn't work. Without sync i've lost all my data. Tried emailing the developers for support but they don't reply.;0
Very expensive for a simple app, and quite useless without buying the premium. Only tracks 5 habits? Lame. I can't believe this is the app advertised in the play store, and still has a high rating because it is garbage. Sounds like even if I bought premium it would be worthless for transferring data to a new phone as the app claims, I won't even risk it.;0
Twice lost all data b/c wouldn't sync. Had over a year of data. Had premium and still didn't make a difference. Moving on. Just done. So upset!;0
You cannot add more than 5 goals in basic, and the premium is expensive;0
Excellent app, highly recommend, have been using this app since it was first getting established and was advertised on reddit. However I cant log on anymore :( I had access on my old phone and now on my new one it says my email address is not in the database! How can I get my access back? This is the only app I like!;0
"has lost features over the years. back when i first used this years ago when it was called habit bull, i could set goals like, ""do this thing x times a week."" that doesn't appear to be an option anymore, so this app has become effectively useless.";0
Paid for the premium app last year, now there is no history of my email address ever being registered despite me having the confirmation emails from them when I first paid for it. Lots of complaints on here. Get one of the open source habit trackers & back it up yourself to cloud storage rather than spending money with devs who change the app name slightly & try to charge again. Seen this happen so many times.;0
I was enjoying this app and decided to buy the premium features. But they took the money and provided nothing at all. I tries contacting the developer via Email and no answer at all. Stay Away.;0
This app doesn't let me log in to my previous account. Once I skipped the initial registration page due to some network issues, I tried logging in but it only shows Sign Up or connect to Facebook which I definitely don't want to use. When I use my previous account on Sign up it tells me that the email is already taken. Please fix this issue.;0
not a bad app but the worst customer service and thw widgets dont work once you pay for premium! just use the free version. your more likely to succeed if you focus on less goals at one time anyhow! DONT BUY PREMIUM!! WHEN IT TURNS OUT IT DOESNT WORK YOU WONT BE ABLE TO GET A REFUND!;0
Don't buy the premium version of this app. Synching doesn't work. Stick with the free version, which would be 4 stars;0
I bought the premium version of this app and it doesn't work. The reminder does not function, which basically renders the app useless. I emailed the support team and I haven't gotten any response or acknowledgement of receipt. I want a refund. What a waste of my money;0
Developer is non-responsive. For some reason when downloading the app from the play store it associates with the incorrect Google account. I have verified I am downloading the app with my intended account, however it continually associates with the wrong account. It's not really a big deal, but I was planning to upgrade to premium with my play store credits. The account this app associates to does not have any.;0
For anyone who wants to use this app: Devs stopped updating this in 2018. So they won't reply to your queries and/or issues. Look elsewhere...;0
Last updated 2018 really!!!! I am a premium user and it crashes sometimes. Bad investment.;0
This is the free version. The paid version is $7.99, the Platinum version is even more. You can only track 5 habits in the free version. Developers must be paid, but a lack of up front honesty makes this product undesirable. (I should charge for this.) Do not install. #doughymiddle;0
Soooo disappointing. Had to find a substitute for my Habit Minder app when I moved to Android. Habit Tracker seemed. The interface is great, love the tracking graphs, but its reminders don't work consistently at all - which defeats the whole purpose!!! Really miss my Habit Minder and hope they make an android version soon.;0
"I bought premium and now I can't login to the app using Facebook. (and I can't login any other way) I get this message: ""Login Failed: You can't use Facebook to log into this app or website because there's an issue with its implementation of Facebook Login.""";0
If you pay for premium, you won't actually get the premium services (as other reviewers have noted). Troubleshooting steps from their site don't work, and no one responds to the support email. Contact Google and they'll reject your refund request.;0
Hello Team, I bought the complete package in Feb 2015. However when I am trying to use HabitBull Premium + Extra, it says no account found in database. Can you please help me with this? Your support team is also not responding to the the ticket which i have raised earlier Support Ticket Opened [#388906];0
App works but I got very disappointed after I purchased the premium features only to discover that sync between devices doesn't work, and that the app developer is completely unresponsive to my support requests, so I wasted my money and am not able to get a refund.;0
I just paid for premium as I was told by the app developers that it would enable me to sync my data from my old android phone onto my new android phone. But it fails everytime I click 'sync'. I sent the developers my feedback but they won't get back to me.;0
"Got hold of the Premium version with high expectations but was disappointed on getting to know that the habits created on a device is not appearing on another device with the same account. Going back to ""Loop"".";0
It's not working properly, always fails to Remind, no more reminder notification, this feature suppose to work for free version, if the promise features in free version doesn't work how can I get confident to buy paid version , request team to fix this issue;0
Confusing. Used to be better long time ago, not anymore. Confusing usability.;0
This was a great app but it hasn't been updated since 2018 and sadly it be can become unusable in an instant with no fixes in sight. I cannot recommend this app. I would try something similar maybe open sources, or with dev support;0
Cash grab, and nothing more. Purchased the app a year ago but now due to an issue on the account being asked to pay for it again. Very disappointed and no response from seller. Last update was 1 year ago so as far as I am concerned the developer abondoned it.;0
The app is very good. Giving one star because, data sync doesn't work even for paid version. So if you change the phone, you lose all tracking history. And as others reviews are saying there is no service by developers.;0
I bought the Premium version and it will not sync. I have snet numerous requests to support and have received no responses;0
"Had accumulated 5 habits that lasted 17 days and counting (now using a different app.) This pathetic app that I paid premium for, would not sync. ""Check internet connection"" every damn time. I paid for the damn app, sadly probably past my refund day!";0
Can only track five habits without premium 🙄🙄 five habits I can just write down in a notebook instead of waiting my time with this app, I wanted to use it to build good habits for 2019 but I'm not gonna pay money to do something I can do with a pen and paper;0
It's been 1 week since I'm using the app. The reminder system worked fine for 1day and from next day the reminder system stopped functioning. Really disappointed. May be uninstalling the app after few days. Hope this helps.;0
I paid for premium, then followed (twice) every single instruction in the FAQ section regarding how to sync data between devices. Syncing did not work. I wasted 2 hours of my day trying to get this app to work.;0
Below Expectation... I purchased this app based on glowing user reviews, created an account in order to sync across my devices, however I find that if I create a habit on one device it doesn't show up on my other device. This needs to be addressed immediately.;0
I lost a couple of years worth data of my habits! I had purchased the premium for sync option. Syn hasn't been working. Extremely disappointed! No reply to emails from you guys! How is this app Editor's choice!?;0
I have paid for premium however it will not let me use its features. I get a message asking me to upgrade to premium everytime I try to add a new habit. if I follow the instructions it just tells me I already own the product. Thanks for stealing my money.;0
The reminders don't work. No noise. No vibration. I even bought premium to see if that would help. No luck. If I wanted a place to just mark my progress, I'd keep an Excel spreadsheet.;0
The notification and alarm functions don't work.;0
Thought there's be at least a basic timer for tasks but there isn't. You have to time yourself elsewhere and enter it on this app. I'm uninstalling because as counterintuitive as it sounds, this app is not a productive use of time.;0
I bought a new phone. Reinstalled this app. Years of habits log, gone! I thought this thing syncs in the background? As some folks have commented, syncing no longer works. No updates. No support responses.;0
Beware - no replies for supoort. I bought this app and switched phones. The app does not recognize my PREMIUM account. I have emailed them 3x with no response. Sent a copy of my receipt and spent time trying to get help... Now I Will spend time giving reviews every time I think of this until it's resolved. Addendum: it's been 4 days since I wrote this... And no reply or offer to help. Speaks volumes.;0
I paid $10 for the full feature set but this app crashes 10-20x per day. I just use it for the widgets and it still crashes over and over and over. Super annoying.;0
The app was last updated on 2018. Looks like the devs abandoned it. I've been having trouble with reminders (a key feature of the app) but haven't heard back from the devs. :/;0
I like the app, but I don't like rating apps, and this one constantly nags you to do so with no option for it to stop. Even with the paid version, so 1 star for being annoying after I've given them my money;0
"I had and paid for the premium version back then when it was called ""Habit Bull"" I loved it but since now they changed to ""Habit Tracker"" I no longer have the premium add ons and they expect for me to pay again. No thanks.";0
awsome application.. i purched it.. but i just want notifation should be blinking on phone like alram clock .. plz add this type of features.. the thing diplys in notifaction should be flash on main screen From last 10 month it's not getting synchronising.. Plz do something @developer We paid for it;0
Thought it was great until I had to reinstall it due to notifications and widgets not working. I can now not login as I'm guessing it's trying my account to my Google account rather then the actual email I used to register;0
2019/10/24 - revised from 5 to 1 star. App is dead. All my data gone. Never again trust an app you cannot export and organize your data, and to a universal format. Avoid as others said recently.;0
Don't buy! Can't login on the app after having paid premium since it was HabitBull. Many people with same problem. No updates for more than a year.;0
why do email ID and password Aap email id qu magate ho eese aapako kayaa 👎👎;0
Do not use this app, lost all my data (something like 3 years) go ahead and read other have the same problems, I even have premium. Now its impossible to login back with FB or email. Really, really disapointed. Developers dont answer any emails.;0
None of the reminders work, notifications turned, only when do I open the app do I get reminded of my activities;0
The notification and alarm functions don't work.;0
Very frustrated with this app. Was using it to track goals, paid for it so I could save data in preparation for switching. Setup new phone, try to login and FB login no longer works and email not recognized. Great app, not worth paying for at all.;0
Just 5 habits free !!!!!!;0
Worst app,, Now I just know that only 5 habit can track freely , there above premium, also payble Back up, But Developer are never inform first.....;0
No longer reminds me to do stuff. Looking for another app now.;0
There is a big banner of a cat and a dog with sime motivational lines on the home page. Also, i can't set up reminder every 2 days although i can set up a habit every two days.;0
limited number of habits only 5;0
[Privacy] Don't install this app. I purchased pro version [IAP] of this app in 2017. In 2018 dev mysteriously resets my account and when I contacted him, he gave me a password in plain text. So, he has my email address and password. I hope you understand that he has my data. I would urge you to switch to any open source app. Please care for your privacy.;0
App keeps crashing;0
The widget doesn't work properly. It only works when i open the app first and then go to widget again. Kindly fix this;0
I purchased the premium app back in 2014, and now that I am trying to use it again it won't recognize me as a premium user. I've contacted support and they have never responded any on my tickets. Poor customer service. I want a refund, or my premium account.;0
Does not allow tracking of more than 5 habits without upgrading. Unable to remove or hide features that are of no use to me. Do not recommend. Waste of time.;0
Worst App. Requires premium membership to sync data even after signing up with Email. What's the use of signing up with Email if you cannot sync the data. It's just a calender without premium membership. Better to use default inbuilt calender app to track your progress than using this application. I've lost all my progress that I've been tracking from 300 days. Shittiest app ever.;0
Can only track 5 habits at a time;0
Really liked the app and have been using premium but now I want to transfer to a new device. I can only doing this by signing up but whenever I go to the sign up section and type my email and password nothing happens and it asks me to sign up again. Really frustrating. If you guys can solve this it will definitely be 5 stars.;0
Limited free goals.;0
This app seemed to have all the features I wanted, but the sync did not work after I paid $10 for the sync feature. I emailed their support with no reply. Very bad customer service.;0
You cannot add more than 5 goals in basic, and the premium is expensive;0
U bought the app but can't reach my premium account;0
Limited to 5 habits in the free trial. Waste of time. This is not a useful free trial for me. I have 7 things I'm tracking;0
I have tried a lot to set up reminder..but unfortunately it's not working which is pretty excruciating as a new user. It seems good initially but this is pissing me off. Do ler me know I can fix up this ..;0
Force closing on Android 10;0
Haven't been able to get a reply from customer support since August 2019 - if you can't get your email registered you can't use this across multiple devices. Super disappointed.;0
I've been using this since 2015.now with new phone. It didn't sync and expect me to upgrade again. Fix it please. Else. It will remain at 1 star. My feedback 👆🏼 posted few weeks ago was ignored. Uninstall for good!;0
Was really enjoying the app but now the widgets stopped working.;0
Only 5 habits;0
I bought the premium access and then when i change my phone, i never could get access to the premium version again... I wrote them an email 2 month ago and i havent received answers yet.;0
DON'T PAY FOR THIS APP IT'S OUTDATED AND NOT SUPPORTED BY DEVELOPPER ANYMORE.;0
Last updated 2018 really!!!! I am a premium user and it crashes sometimes. Bad investment.;0
"After purchase, sync is not working. Then y sholud I purchase this app. Profile name is empty, while editing it says ""something went wrong"". And app is completely crash now. Not at all opening.";0
Only 5 habits. If you dont want to pay it's not worth having.;0
Couldnt create an account, wouldnt let me past the setting up account page;0
Such a bad experience. I bought the app and now it says they can't find my email id in their database. I am trying to reach them for 4 days. No response. just automated mails. so pathetic.;0
Many bugs: - Some deleted habits appears suddenly, combine with current ones - Some habits: successful days not linked each other. (I'm a premium user);0
Confusing. Used to be better long time ago, not anymore. Confusing usability.;0
Stupid app;0
It doesn't work or show any reminders whatsoever and no picturea as it says. I wasted my money;0
Sync problem is a deal-breaker. All that info is now lost. I used it for over a year. :(;0
For anyone who wants to use this app: Devs stopped updating this in 2018. So they won't reply to your queries and/or issues. Look elsewhere...;0
I'm unsatisfied with this application Not show negative feedback so it can't best app;0
Twice lost all data b/c wouldn't sync. Had over a year of data. Had premium and still didn't make a difference. Moving on. Just done. So upset!;0
I love the app, but it won't sync.;0
The Premium version of the App does not sync across multiple devices. I use an android phone and a chromebook and it still does not work. Don't bother with Premium.;0
I have an error that makes me unable to sync due to a connection error though clearly I am connected to the internet. I am a premium user. The app is great but please help me with my problem. I'm tired of taking screenshots of all my pages every week as my remedy for the sync error.;0
I just bought premium and realized I made a mistake right away! It told me to register to sync my data and I did. Sync option wouldn't do anything. I wasn't able to set a username because of some unknown error all the time. Then half the screen was empty and I decided it was a glitch and reinstalled it and now ALL MY DATA IS GONE! So stupid! I just paid 10 bucks to be able to create more than 5 habits and I lost everything! Don't recommend this app, so disappointed...;0
Guess I can't use this app after paying for premium 😧;0
Update 2020: sadly they didn't reach out to me despite me paying for premium version. Lost my account and no means of logging back in. Otherwise, the app is good especially the UI. Like this app but until recently I had to change phones and the database could not locate my email and the app changed names and logo so it's all confusing. If you could help me locate my account as I bought the premium version but couldnt log in to my account. Please help because I want to use this great app!;0
"App was good in past but not anymore, it has stopped sync and many bugs creeped in due to no maintenance and update since. As per details in app Page, last update was on 28th Jun 2018, but still it is the first thing that comes in results when I search for ""Habit"" 😲 I guess Google should stop advertising an app that is not managed since years.";0
Sync doesn't work despite having a lifetime premium account, as others have said.;0
Used to be good, now support is gone and can't sync devices anymore. Pity;0
The app itself is great. I used it quite regularly a few years back but when I tried to use it again it seems that the 'new' owners don't acknowledge their 'lifetime' subscription. Sure hope my emails get more results besides ... /ignore kthnxbye Sent an email ... they said they opened a ticket and then ... crickets. Nice .. thanks, downgraded to;0
Not updated anymore. Unstable;0
Don't buy the premium version of this app. Synching doesn't work. Stick with the free version, which would be 4 stars;0
NOBODY USE THIS APP. Read all the forums. The app does not support the sync once you've bought premium. Everyone's saying the same. And the devs DO NOT RESPOND TO HELP REQUESTS. I have an error that makes me unable to sync due to a connection error though clearly I am connected to the internet. I am a premium user. The app is great but please help me with my problem. I'm tired of taking screenshots of all my pages every week as my remedy for the sync error.;0
Ugly ui jiss. Fb login dosent work.;0
I bought the Premium version and it will not sync. I have snet numerous requests to support and have received no responses;0
Used to be awesome, now I can't sync, log out or save changes made to habits. The quotes is stuck on same one. I have changed passwords, uninstalled and reinstalled, emailed your company and all but deleted app as it no longer keeps record. Please resolve .;0
Spamming me to rate. Well here you go....;0
Update: dropped 5 star rating to 1star. App will not sync. I have it on Android and iPad,and neither one of them will sync to the server. App store shows 8 months since any updates. Would not have paid for premium if I knew it wasn't going to be maintained. Original review: I wanted to make something like this myself, but they've already done a great job. I feel more obligated to the daily habits I'm trying to build, and it's great that it tracks my completion streaks.;0
App crashes;0
This app lost all my data. I would sync every day but when I had to reinstall and tried to sync-nothing. I had paid the money for premium but now it wants me to pay again.;0
"The idea behind the app is good. Although, after paying for premium, the promised cloud sync does not work (several users mention the same issue). There is no way of backup the data either. I cannot see any feedback from devs here. Switched to a different app: ""Habits.""";0
If it's a passion project I'd be willing to support the creator, but this seems to now be held by just a shell holding.;0
Premium does not work. False advertising!;0
Find a new app. Overall if you havent noticed, the dev's left this app. As of recently, the servers are dead. This means you cant make an account, forums are gone, motivation pictures gone, etc. Find a new app,;0
How do i get a refund?;0
I was enjoying this app and decided to buy the premium features. But they took the money and provided nothing at all. I tries contacting the developer via Email and no answer at all. Stay Away.;0
I have been using the app from the last 3 years. I am a premium user. When trying to sign in a new device and sync, it's not syncing. I need my data. please help with this issue. Even after reaching to the support team tonnes of times no one is responding. So i am changing the rating from 3 to 1.;0
Vorrei avere indietro i miei soldi visto che il login non funziona e che non sembra esistere un'assistenza tecnica. I want my money back since I cannot login;0
"Don't install this app.This is forgery. I've used this app for more than 2 years when I changed my mobile phone I couldn't login when I logged in it says ""this email account is not in our database"" I have the mail to prove that I had had the account in the App.I mailed the company 4-5 times but there's no reply. 2 years of my habit data is lost.";0
Decent, but premium features like Sync do not work, can't even reimport data you exported yourself. Had I realized this I would have never have bought the app, it's just false advertising. I now have to figure out how to port my data to another app where it won't be inevitably lost.;0
Do not pay for the app. Sync doesn't work , they dont support the app but they are always ready to take your money.;0
After installing this app my phone received an increased amount of spam calls. After removing the app from my phone I received fewer spam calls. It might be a coincidence... But it might not be.;0
*Update* 11/02/20 USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! As expected, no contact from developers. App has not been updated since 2018. This app was great for a month until it kept freezing my phone. A de/reinstall has now lost all my data and looking at other users with this issue, it looks like it is lost forever because of the sync function never working and no contact from developers. Very upset and disappointed.;0
The app itself gets the job done, but it will not sync and the developer is not responsive to questions. Don't waste your money with premium. You won't get what you pay for.;0
I paid for habitbull premium for the sync functionality, which fully does not work. I've tried reinstalling the app, reinstalling android, getting a new phone. No luck. Emailed habitbull a month ago and still no reply. If I want to take a backup I have to screenshot everything. not ideal Apart from this the app is decent. It's got a cute meme;0
stealing in 2020: make an app, call it HabitBull, make people buy it, remove it from playstore, republish the same app with a different name.;0
Paid for premium. Sync does not work. Publisher does not reply. Started reading reviews and found numerous people with the same problem. Going to try to get my money back. Nice app if you don't care about backups or syncing between devices or customer support. Switched to Goalify and finding them extremely responsive;0
"Updating my previous review. I recently hit the two year mark on one of my habits, yet the app only shows me of having 30 days. This is the same bug I reported last year. It appears that it does not recognize some of my habits over the New Year. I've reported this problem four times now and have never heard back from anyone. I'm giving up on this app, and suggest you do too. ""I've used this for a couple of years. There was a bug where one week of my tracking wasn't recognized by the app. This happened the week of New Years. I reached out to the developer five times about it and never heard back. Unfortunately, this has become an unreliable app for tracking.""";0
This app doesnt sync data.;0
The widget and sync functions does not work on premium. I get the widget error telling me to log in but I already have and even reinstalled the app. Nothing works. Developer, please fix this.;0
No further improvement. UI is kinda suck, there are many better alternatives;0
This was a great app but it hasn't been updated since 2018 and sadly it be can become unusable in an instant with no fixes in sight. I cannot recommend this app. I would try something similar maybe open sources, or with dev support;0
Paid for premium so I could sync between devices, but it doesn't work and customer service will not respond to my inquiries.;0
Paid premium, it doesn't sync at all. Costumer service unresponsive for a long time. Don't spend money on Premium, this app is dead, the last update was in 2018;0
Good app, but no updates even after sending few suggestions. What is the point in buying Paid version.;0
Sync not working. Don't buy in-app purchase.;0
Paid for premium. Does not sync.;0
Failed to connect to Facebook;0
Facebook login fails with an error from Facebook saying the login method hasn't bee implemented correctly.;0
Lost all my data when I moved to ios;0
Hyper masculine tone is very off-putting and irritating. Hint to developers: Women try to change habits too! At least give us the option of just having hints in our own words...;0
Paid for the premium app last year, now there is no history of my email address ever being registered despite me having the confirmation emails from them when I first paid for it. Lots of complaints on here. Get one of the open source habit trackers & back it up yourself to cloud storage rather than spending money with devs who change the app name slightly & try to charge again. Seen this happen so many times.;0
Does not sync across my devices, which it claimed it does. Only reason I purchased. Looking for my refund.;0
It's working anymore after paying for premium;0
Does not log in. After 5 minites it's still trying to log itself in.;0
"Had accumulated 5 habits that lasted 17 days and counting (now using a different app.) This pathetic app that I paid premium for, would not sync. ""Check internet connection"" every damn time. I paid for the damn app, sadly probably past my refund day!";0
Advertises that you own your data and you can export your progress. In reality, they don't let you access that feature without a premium membership. I don't mind paying for features and services, but keeping your data behind a paywall is dirty. I'd recommend finding a FOSS habit tracker.;0
A little too complicated and dictatorial (too many prompts). Plus only 5 habits allowed unless u buy the pro version! 7-10 habits and I may hv left it on my device and give it a proper run. Instead I decided to uninstall and download a simpler version which is more flexible and suitable to my needs.;0
Very simple UI. Potentially too simple and plain but hard to tell without using it for extended period of time, some may like it scaled back look. Can only add 5 habits before having to pay a fee for premium. Hardly enough to actually truly test drive the app before paying. Seems costly for the simplicity of the app.;0
Reminders only pop up when I remember to open the app, which defeats the whole purpose. If the reminders popped up automatically at the set times, I'd give the app 5 stars.;0
Man, this app is great. Simple but complete, which makes it very effective. Customization options for habits are excellent and connecting to specific communities a huge plus. Highly recommended if you want to keep track of your progress towards a goal! Updated: logging features are still as good as ever, but since syncing is impossible, I can't see the forum anymore as my user doesn't properly log in and there is no customer service, I can't recommend it anymore...;0
"very simple app to track your progress towards acquiring a habit, the only downside is that you can't sync the app as it says ""no internet connection"" when there absolutely is. Also, together with this bug all forums are no longer available as well as daily quotes, it's just gone. Previous rating was 5 stars, but with this bug continuing for half a year now I can only give 2 stars.";0
Can't see new topics of discussion. Also can't add discussion topic even though I have excellent internet connection, Wi Fi or Data. Please fix. I have no connection issues with any of my other apps.;0
I like this app, I bought the premium version last year and I still can't synchronize my data, I have to change my phone and I will lose all the data! Could you fix that?;0
I liked the app and I purchased it. But I can't sync any data from old phone. And when logged out of the app, there is no way to login again except reinstall the app. So if anyone is fine with restart all the progress everytime you change phone, this app is for you. But since I like to keep my progress to the new phone, I am stop using this app and find another one.;0
"Good app but don't bother with premium. I bought premium for the ""powerful widgets"" and ability to track extra habits. Don't bother. The widgets are nothing special and if you read the tips section the developer even says it's best to only track a few habits at a time! After feeling ripped off I emailed the developer twice requesting a refund but have received no reply. Great free app but don't waste your money on premium.";0
I loved the app and purchased it to help my son keep up with studying. I paid for the premium account which indicates you can log in on multiple devices both iOS and Android. After setting it up on my phone, which was easy but took some time,when I tried logging onto my son's phone it didn't recognize the account. I contacted customer service but didn't hear back. It's a nice app, really like the features, so this was really disappointing. I could set it up again on his phone but without me being able to monitor on my phone it's not helpful. I still hope someone can help me fix this or I should get a refund for my purchase.;0
It seems like this app is no longer supported. I've paid for premium, but sync stopped working several months ago, and developers have not replied to a support request. So - on moving to a new phone - my habits and streaks are now lost. I can see from other reviews that this is a widely reported issue. I guess the app has now been abandoned.;0
I upgraded to Pro after a couple of weeks & initially excited about the app. Having used it for a while now I'm starting to regret my purchase. There are some pros but more cons. It's buggy, doesn't sync well at all across devices, the UI is very cluttered, the forum needs serious updating, a search tool for eg. The last update was ages ago, given how pricey this is you'd think the developers would make it worth it but they seem to have disappeared!;0
Seems like it could be very helpful. Getting very frustrated with it always opening on monthly view even though I have weekly view selected in settings. Even tried switching it, but no matter what opens on monthly;0
I like how the app has options to write notes/journals for each day. It gives you the option to reflect on how you stuck to your habits. Most other apps don't have this feature. That said, I'm rating the app two stars because the notifications don't work for me. I have set times for reminders throughout the day, but the app sends me random notifications (reminders) when I don't want them. And on other days, no notifications at all. No app updates from the developer in over a year either.;0
The app is good to use overall. Except, as a number of other folks have said, it does not sync. And there is no response from the developer on this issue. Annoying to have paid for an app that claimed the sync feature, when it doesn't actually work. What that means is you lose all history every time you change the phone.;0
Complexity and unavailability of useful feature for free kill the interest. Atleast widget should be available for trials.;0
DO NOT BUY PREMIUM Version!! App stopped synching 7/27/2019 and is no longer supported. I got Premium to sync to new phone since I've been using the app for over a year and wanted to keep tracking. $10 wasted! Very disappointing because basic version is great - simple but fully functional and effective for tracking up to 5 habits. Good visuals and the ability to make notes. Premium = tracking >5 habits and syncing across devices but no more! Would be 4 stars if still supported and worked.;0
I love the ease of the application and the setup. I don't like that the way they send you reminders that are sometimes rude or shame-based. it doesn't make me want to try any harder when I get scolded for not fulfilling my goals. positive encouragement as the best way.;0
Reminders are not working. I have an Asus ZenFone 4 (shouldn't matter) and I have set the reminders multiple times with no success. I feel this is the most important part of this app as I need reminding in order to affectively create a habit. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. My rating my change after feedback.;0
Customer support is completely unresponsive. I purchased the upgraded version and it doesn't sync as promised. There has been no help on FB, email, nada. Kinda sucks TBH. The app is nice. The Android widget is what makes it great. Plz fix the sync issue and I'll update my review if your customer support reaolves the matter and makes things right with me.;0
Only the premium version is good for use free version is a waste of time;0
It's misleading to list data export as a reason to buy Premium, when it is not included with Premium. It would be great if you could change this to accurately describe your three tier pricing system. Additionally, the Platinum purchase option is currently showing me the full price even though it is advertising a 33% off. The greyed out full price is exactly the same as the 33% off price. Will give higher star review when these are fixed..;0
After changing my email, I cannot use HabitBull's premium features. I have tried emailing support--no response--and finding a way to restore the purchase or even purchase it again, but no such luck. I am forever stuck with the app thinking I have pro, even though I do not. It's a shame, really, for what is otherwise a fantastic app.;0
This would be great if it didn't require me to mark negatives. in other words, it requires me to mark everyday I did NOT do something, such as smoke a cigarette or drink alcohol. This is overly cumbersome over time and is going to cause me to stop using the app because I don't want to have to check everything that DIDN'T happen. This could be much better if it assumes I didn't drink or smoke if I didn't make any mark for that day. Or at least give me the option to do it this way.;0
Widget freezes, app does not sync. I had a galaxy S7 edge and just got an S10+. App fails with both phones. Regret spending money on this.;0
Too much configuration, not very intuitive, I'm looking for something simple that only counts something for the day, not to set goals, reminders, notes, and all that overload of information that keep jumping from screen to screen, not looking for enterprise app just for personal use.;0
No Resent Updates, no Local Backup Option. Other than that it's Good.;0
App is very good for what it is, but the sync feature stopped working for me. The FAQ says it's due to a rooted phone but this happened twice on non-rooted phones. HabitBull offers no support to fix. 2 stars bec it works standalone, but if you need syncing know there's a risk of permanent failure.;0
Unable to import any data from the .csv file in cloud!!! No option to get any data back! Bought premium and im not happy. Beware!!!;0
I love that you can chose x amount of days a week to complete a habit, other apps force you to commit to specific days, the flexibility in this app helps me succeed, what I hate about this app is it fails to get my habit completion-for example I did my workout for the day but still receive repeated notices to do said workout for that day. way to drain any joy out of an accomplishment habitbull!;0
Great app in the beginning. But once you start skipping days, the notifications become insulting shaming words. For example, calling me a couch potato. Which I am not. So dumb. What expert would ever say that insults are motivational? Almost none. I'd rather use an app based on the principle of kindness, not shaming.;0
Sync no longer works. Also app has been buggy lately - closes down and does not respond. I'm now using Loop Habit Tracker which is more stable.;0
Can login with facebook because there is an issue with login implementation. Uninstalling;0
While i can understand limiting somethings for premium only, i've never seen an app block widgets behind a pay wall and quite frankly this is only useful to me if I can keep track of things on the homescreen. Maybe I would have liked it but so far i havent used it because i keep forgetting its there.;0
Worked well for a few days and then just stopped sending reminders. The reminders would pop up if I opened the app myself but that's obviously not the point of a reminder. Also, froze a lot. Pretty much useless. When it worked, it was excellent.;0
I really like this app. Enough to purchase the premium a few years back, but the app didn't update to premium for me, and there was no response when I contacted the support. Seems like I'm not alone in this experience. Don't put your trust in the developers!;0
Fine for tracking, but the reminders stop working after a couple of weeks (this has happened with every new habit I've set up, and I have a premium account) and the developer doesn't respond to support requests.;0
The tracker itself is not bad but I set up a notification to remind me to do something and am not getting them. I already checked my settings, all is good. It's nice if you remember to go in and mark done but notifications are not working.;0
I like the overall app. It is the best. But even after setting the reminder for my habits. I do not receive any notification or reminder. I have checked with my notification settings for this app and it is turned on.;0
I had my phone switched off one day at the time my reminder usually pops up. Ever since then I've not got notifications at all, no matter if I try reset them or whatever. Kinda annoying because the calendar app on my phone has also stopped giving notifications lately so I keep forgetting to take my medication.;0
I like that it allows specific habits, I don't like that it does not give proper percentages of how much you've done your habits. after using it about a month i deleted it, because even though i was doing almost every habit 100%, it kept giving me <50%. it was demoralizing.;0
I bought a premium subscription, but I can't get my devices syncing. I'm quite disappointed.;0
I would not recommend this app bc of an essential flaw in design - it doesn't allow you to just type in habit, instead it quizzes you. So, a simple act of just typing what you'd like to do turns into this crazy and overly complicated thing.;0
I'm changing the rating into two stars because the sync feature which previously work fine has no longer work. Looking at the last update I feel like the developer had abandoned this apps, which is quite sad considering this usef to be the best apps on building habit.;0
Worked really well, however the widgets work for a day then won't respond unless removed and re-added. . . Eevveerryy day. won't remember to actually use it without the widgets, so its useless now. not worth paying extra.;0
Good design, simple and clear but with the option to dig down for more details. However, they don't respond to emails and haven't released an update in over a year. Seems like this project was abandoned.;0
Used to be a great app, but I've moved phones, but the sync did not work and all tracking data has been lost. Even after having paid $18 for premium. Very much a shame.;0
Unable to log in, unable to create a new account or link to facebook;0
Really? $8 for a habit tracker? There are other apps that do the same thing for far less money. I don't mind paying for apps, but this seems like price gouging. Oh, and it's $10 if you want the ability to export your data!;0
Free version allows only up to 5 habits to be added, but app description doesn't mention it. Had to spend an hour setting up habits then uninstall the app and find a new one.;0
Can't choose when to start. I like setting goals/habits for advance dates once I'm done with one+. Also, you can't edit a habit/goal to start over, you have to delete and start new. Doesn't save your previous habits/goals to do again.;0
Used to be my favorite app! Changed phones and it doesn't recognize my premium purchase. I've been emailing for support for two months with no response. So disappointed.;0
The motivational messages are annoying. You can only track up to 5 habits in the free version but it is totally not worth paying for more. Good riddance. I suppo this kind of app is just not for me.;0
Password reset is broken, cannot transfer it to a new cell phone. Think twice before buying this app. The habit-related side is good, however - this is why I bought it.;0
Had annoyances with the UI, the font was too big for me and I couldn't see a lot of things at once. And for all its gimmicks, it's really just a simple app.;0
The app has stopped synching and cant get it working very frustrating. I paid for premium and no one replies to help resolve which is a real shame as the actual app when working is very good.;0
Love the app. Would love a version for Windows/Chrome to use on PC. Also I bought a premium version and now when I opened the app after 4 months it has reset itself to the non-premium version.;0
it's not worth the premium. I tried to get a refund because it wasn't what I thought it would be and no one has contacted me. They claim to read every single email but can't reply to a paid customer. I will be deleting this app and regretting the $8 purchase;0
I m just very lazy enough to use this app plus this app is not based on concept of habit building.Let's see how habbit is built u do task u get reward but here for sake of reward u only get Dots connected in pattern that's not motivating instead u can give some offers as reward.;0
I buy the platinum app, but the reminders doesn't work!!! Please fix it! . It's a great app but the reminders are very important to me.;0
Paid for this years ago and used it on another device. Now I have a new phone and when I'm trying to login it says my email address is not in the database.;0
Works OK on Galaxy note 8 but constant crash notifications. Can't even log on to the tablet version let alone sync accounts. In the end all data lost and so am I.;0
Widget Request: please could you add a feature that pushes undone tasks to the top of the widget? Or an option that removes done tasks from the widget.   Good job on the app otheriwise, I'll repurchase if you can add this, love the snooze function.;0
The app is constantly loading and you can't even record your habits, and reminders don't work also, having just 5 habits free is bad too.;0
none of the notifications work. other people in the forums teport similar problems bht no fix. the app is nice but it isnt nearly as functional without notifications;0
I was testing this to replace Fabulous. So far the notifications are not persistent enough. Fabulous is able to wake me up in the morning.;0
i like this app but one thing that i hate , why do i have to be member of premiums ( i mean why do i have to pay ? ) if i want to track up more than 5 habit ? this is a free app right ? please can you consider or change something about it;0
Started off really well but has stopped working properly now. Great shame as it has a lot of promise.;0
Loading takes too long and reminders don't work.;0
Claims syncing but it always fails to sync. Lost all data when got new phone. Donwgrading to two stars.;0
Can't sync!! I paid to have the ability to make more tasks, but that's about all it's good for.;0
Only 3 stars because after the first 5 options No more Then u have to pay;0
great app but waaay to complicated, deleted it and replaced with a different simpler app. interface looks cool though.;0
Free version gives only 5 habits, there are far clearer and better trackers available for free.;0
Love and use the app BUT sync feature does not work and my attempts at eliciting support from customer service have gone unanswered which is disappointing.;0
I don't like the layout at all. I want it to be much more simple and quick to edit my daily tasks.;0
Only 5 free without telling users upfront that you will have to PAY for more. Always about the money. Sorry I wasted time on setting this up.;0
Syncing devices doesn't work, even after reading and applying suggestions in the FAQ of the website...;0
Too expensive and without paying, there's no backup. There's free apps that do the same thing.;0
bought premium version, didn't get upgrade, sent proof of payment, still no response. not good;0
I bought the premium. And I can't sync the data between my devices.;0
Mixed great app but don't by premium. Won't work without play services and developer unresponsive;0
The moderation of the discussion bards in the app leaves something to be desired. Needs better moderation.;0
Two stars because facebook login is not fixed for an year. Is this application still supported by the dev team?;0
free version is all you need, paid version is overpriced and a waste of google credits;0
Hello Habitbull team, I need to check all features in premium version so can you give me access to premium version for 2 days so that I can try all features and check if the feature that I need is present or not and then buy premium version.;0
the layout was good but it only lets you track 5 habits for free;0
Paid widget feature!!!!! One thing that downplays all other.;0
well, It is good and motivational, but I don't get notifications for the reminder. Moreover, you have to pay for the widget;0
not a bad app but DONT pay for the premium. The widgets dont work!!;0
Free version only supports 5 habits which is basically nothing;0
I liked the app until it told me I could only have 5 goals. :(;0
I've set a reminder for me to drink water... It doesn't remind at all!!!;0
Too much fluff. Difficult to see the actual progress.;0
Free account limited to 5 habits;0
The motivation pics stopped at some level and dont want to be changed, pls solve this issue;0
Only 5 items on free version. Would be nice to have that clear so I don't have to waste my time and give out my email.;0
only a few habits for free, not worth paying for;0
An Image is not showed sometimes. Functions are excellent, but the app's UX/UI isn't good.;0
Reminders ain't working!;0
A little too complicated and dictatorial (too many prompts). Plus only 5 habits allowed unless u buy the pro version! 7-10 habits and I may hv left it on my device and give it a proper run. Instead I decided to uninstall and download a simpler version which is more flexible and suitable to my needs.;0
Free account limited to 5 habits;0
Reminders only pop up when I remember to open the app, which defeats the whole purpose. If the reminders popped up automatically at the set times, I'd give the app 5 stars.;0
Complexity and unavailability of useful feature for free kill the interest. Atleast widget should be available for trials.;0
Advertises that you own your data and you can export your progress. In reality, they don't let you access that feature without a premium membership. I don't mind paying for features and services, but keeping your data behind a paywall is dirty. I'd recommend finding a FOSS habit tracker.;0
Very simple UI. Potentially too simple and plain but hard to tell without using it for extended period of time, some may like it scaled back look. Can only add 5 habits before having to pay a fee for premium. Hardly enough to actually truly test drive the app before paying. Seems costly for the simplicity of the app.;0
Only the premium version is good for use free version is a waste of time;0
No Resent Updates, no Local Backup Option. Other than that it's Good.;0
Only 3 stars because after the first 5 options No more Then u have to pay;0
Can login with facebook because there is an issue with login implementation. Uninstalling;0
Reminders haven't been working.;0
I like this app, I bought the premium version last year and I still can't synchronize my data, I have to change my phone and I will lose all the data! Could you fix that?;0
Man, this app is great. Simple but complete, which makes it very effective. Customization options for habits are excellent and connecting to specific communities a huge plus. Highly recommended if you want to keep track of your progress towards a goal! Updated: logging features are still as good as ever, but since syncing is impossible, I can't see the forum anymore as my user doesn't properly log in and there is no customer service, I can't recommend it anymore...;0
I bought a premium subscription, but I can't get my devices syncing. I'm quite disappointed.;0
Sync no longer working:(;0
Edit: Initially gave it 4.5 stars. The app itself still works fine, but the sync stopped working about a year ago. That's the main reason I paid for the premium version. I messaged the developer about it and never heard back. Wonder if it's been abandoned by the developer?;0
Seems like it could be very helpful. Getting very frustrated with it always opening on monthly view even though I have weekly view selected in settings. Even tried switching it, but no matter what opens on monthly;0
I liked it when I first got it several years ago. But after installing it on several devices, I found it does not sync with the other instances of it. After getting no response from their support desk, I uninstalled the three apps from the three devices and reinstalled them using my google account in case I had not logged in with the same account on all. The three new instantiations do not sync. The help desk is non-existent. The idea is good but the app is defective.;0
"very simple app to track your progress towards acquiring a habit, the only downside is that you can't sync the app as it says ""no internet connection"" when there absolutely is. Also, together with this bug all forums are no longer available as well as daily quotes, it's just gone. Previous rating was 5 stars, but with this bug continuing for half a year now I can only give 2 stars.";0
Widget freezes, app does not sync. I had a galaxy S7 edge and just got an S10+. App fails with both phones. Regret spending money on this.;0
Unable to import any data from the .csv file in cloud!!! No option to get any data back! Bought premium and im not happy. Beware!!!;0
Can't see new topics of discussion. Also can't add discussion topic even though I have excellent internet connection, Wi Fi or Data. Please fix. I have no connection issues with any of my other apps.;0
Loading takes too long and reminders don't work.;0
Unable to log in, unable to create a new account or link to facebook;0
The moderation of the discussion bards in the app leaves something to be desired. Needs better moderation.;0

"I've been using this app for more than 5 years, it was great. But currently I changed my phone and found out that syncing doesn't work anymore :( It says something like ""no internet connection"". So at the end I have to use another app.";0
I really like this app. Enough to purchase the premium a few years back, but the app didn't update to premium for me, and there was no response when I contacted the support. Seems like I'm not alone in this experience. Don't put your trust in the developers!;0
Mixed great app but don't by premium. Won't work without play services and developer unresponsive;0
EDIT/UPDATE - Purchased premium. Sync doesn't work. A quick glance at developers FB/Twitter accounts shows that they have basically dropped off the face of the Earth (no activity since 2018). App hasn't received an update since 2018. My suggestion: pick an app that's still actively developed. Exactly what I have been looking for. Fantastic interface and thoughtful design. I'm hooked guys!;0
Worked fine for months, now it doesn't track habits the way I set them. It treats every day as its own success or failure regardless of how I have set it up. Going to have to uninstall and find a new habit tracking app.;0
The motivational messages are annoying. You can only track up to 5 habits in the free version but it is totally not worth paying for more. Good riddance. I suppo this kind of app is just not for me.;0
The tracker itself is not bad but I set up a notification to remind me to do something and am not getting them. I already checked my settings, all is good. It's nice if you remember to go in and mark done but notifications are not working.;0
Can't choose when to start. I like setting goals/habits for advance dates once I'm done with one+. Also, you can't edit a habit/goal to start over, you have to delete and start new. Doesn't save your previous habits/goals to do again.;0
I liked the app until it told me I could only have 5 goals. :(;0
The *only* part of this app that doesn't impress me is the widgets, everything else is beautiful! Good visual layouts, simple quick tracking, but enough features to be flexible for different needs. UPDATE 12/30/2019: The app no longer syncs and does not import data. I've got a handy cvs export with 3,000+ lines of habit data, thank goodness, but can no longer reccomend the app if it requires manual input to restore data.;0
I had to buy this app because I need that larger widget to fit my needs, and you cannot test it out with the free version. Sadly, it's too buggy to be of any use, at least on the AIO Launcher. Still overall better than my last habits tracker, but I feel ripped off.;0
Customer support is completely unresponsive. I purchased the upgraded version and it doesn't sync as promised. There has been no help on FB, email, nada. Kinda sucks TBH. The app is nice. The Android widget is what makes it great. Plz fix the sync issue and I'll update my review if your customer support reaolves the matter and makes things right with me.;0
Only 5 items on free version. Would be nice to have that clear so I don't have to waste my time and give out my email.;0
Love and use the app BUT sync feature does not work and my attempts at eliciting support from customer service have gone unanswered which is disappointing.;0
Worked well for a few days and then just stopped sending reminders. The reminders would pop up if I opened the app myself but that's obviously not the point of a reminder. Also, froze a lot. Pretty much useless. When it worked, it was excellent.;0
Can't sync!! I paid to have the ability to make more tasks, but that's about all it's good for.;0
I really think the math is off on this. Logically it does NOT make sense that if you have a good day your percentage of success goes up by 1, but if you have a bad day it goes down 20%. That really defeats the point of motivation and self forgiveness.;0
The app has stopped synching and cant get it working very frustrating. I paid for premium and no one replies to help resolve which is a real shame as the actual app when working is very good.;0
Used to be a great app, but I've moved phones, but the sync did not work and all tracking data has been lost. Even after having paid $18 for premium. Very much a shame.;0
I was testing this to replace Fabulous. So far the notifications are not persistent enough. Fabulous is able to wake me up in the morning.;0
DO NOT BUY PREMIUM Version!! App stopped synching 7/27/2019 and is no longer supported. I got Premium to sync to new phone since I've been using the app for over a year and wanted to keep tracking. $10 wasted! Very disappointing because basic version is great - simple but fully functional and effective for tracking up to 5 habits. Good visuals and the ability to make notes. Premium = tracking >5 habits and syncing across devices but no more! Would be 4 stars if still supported and worked.;0
While i can understand limiting somethings for premium only, i've never seen an app block widgets behind a pay wall and quite frankly this is only useful to me if I can keep track of things on the homescreen. Maybe I would have liked it but so far i havent used it because i keep forgetting its there.;0

Great app in the beginning. But once you start skipping days, the notifications become insulting shaming words. For example, calling me a couch potato. Which I am not. So dumb. What expert would ever say that insults are motivational? Almost none. I'd rather use an app based on the principle of kindness, not shaming.;0
The app is good to use overall. Except, as a number of other folks have said, it does not sync. And there is no response from the developer on this issue. Annoying to have paid for an app that claimed the sync feature, when it doesn't actually work. What that means is you lose all history every time you change the phone.;0
Really? $8 for a habit tracker? There are other apps that do the same thing for far less money. I don't mind paying for apps, but this seems like price gouging. Oh, and it's $10 if you want the ability to export your data!;0
It seems like this app is no longer supported. I've paid for premium, but sync stopped working several months ago, and developers have not replied to a support request. So - on moving to a new phone - my habits and streaks are now lost. I can see from other reviews that this is a widely reported issue. I guess the app has now been abandoned.;0
The app is constantly loading and you can't even record your habits, and reminders don't work also, having just 5 habits free is bad too.;0
Paid widget feature!!!!! One thing that downplays all other.;0
I like how the app has options to write notes/journals for each day. It gives you the option to reflect on how you stuck to your habits. Most other apps don't have this feature. That said, I'm rating the app two stars because the notifications don't work for me. I have set times for reminders throughout the day, but the app sends me random notifications (reminders) when I don't want them. And on other days, no notifications at all. No app updates from the developer in over a year either.;0
Does not sync;0
worked okay for awhile. sync between devices no longer works and I have the paid for premium account. uninstalled on both devices. sync fails on both;0
I liked the app and I purchased it. But I can't sync any data from old phone. And when logged out of the app, there is no way to login again except reinstall the app. So if anyone is fine with restart all the progress everytime you change phone, this app is for you. But since I like to keep my progress to the new phone, I am stop using this app and find another one.;0
No notification of Habit tracks;0
"Good app but don't bother with premium. I bought premium for the ""powerful widgets"" and ability to track extra habits. Don't bother. The widgets are nothing special and if you read the tips section the developer even says it's best to only track a few habits at a time! After feeling ripped off I emailed the developer twice requesting a refund but have received no reply. Great free app but don't waste your money on premium.";0
Desde hace unos meses no sirve la Sync ni me deja entrar a la cuenta;0
Generalle good and easy to use. Unfortunately the sync/backup feature seems to be broken so I can't transfer habits to a different device. The CSV export is also useless, as theres bo way to open it in a different device.;0
Cannot sync. What is going on?;0
The app doesn't really look like the screenshots. It's also quite outdated in design. If you don't mind paying for it then it gets the job done.;0
I'm changing the rating into two stars because the sync feature which previously work fine has no longer work. Looking at the last update I feel like the developer had abandoned this apps, which is quite sad considering this usef to be the best apps on building habit.;0
Slow updates, bugs;0
please add a feature that make me add a friend to the habit such as habit competition app😥 i can't live without this feature;0
not a bad app but DONT pay for the premium. The widgets dont work!!;0
App is very good for what it is, but the sync feature stopped working for me. The FAQ says it's due to a rooted phone but this happened twice on non-rooted phones. HabitBull offers no support to fix. 2 stars bec it works standalone, but if you need syncing know there's a risk of permanent failure.;0
unable to register via manual and via fb;0
I like that it allows specific habits, I don't like that it does not give proper percentages of how much you've done your habits. after using it about a month i deleted it, because even though i was doing almost every habit 100%, it kept giving me <50%. it was demoralizing.;0
A little too confusing.;0
good;0
the app requires premium membership to use the widget. defeats the point for me;0
I m just very lazy enough to use this app plus this app is not based on concept of habit building.Let's see how habbit is built u do task u get reward but here for sake of reward u only get Dots connected in pattern that's not motivating instead u can give some offers as reward.;0
Worked really well, however the widgets work for a day then won't respond unless removed and re-added. . . Eevveerryy day. won't remember to actually use it without the widgets, so its useless now. not worth paying extra.;0
couldn't login with Facebook;0
It is completely failing on reminders!;0
I regret buying the premium version, a lot of money for only a minor update. I wish I could get a refund. Do not buy the premium version from the app, it doesn't worth your money;0
I upgraded to Pro after a couple of weeks & initially excited about the app. Having used it for a while now I'm starting to regret my purchase. There are some pros but more cons. It's buggy, doesn't sync well at all across devices, the UI is very cluttered, the forum needs serious updating, a search tool for eg. The last update was ages ago, given how pricey this is you'd think the developers would make it worth it but they seem to have disappeared!;0
Please change the logo;0
Terrible UI;0
i like this app but one thing that i hate , why do i have to be member of premiums ( i mean why do i have to pay ? ) if i want to track up more than 5 habit ? this is a free app right ? please can you consider or change something about it;0
This would be great if it didn't require me to mark negatives. in other words, it requires me to mark everyday I did NOT do something, such as smoke a cigarette or drink alcohol. This is overly cumbersome over time and is going to cause me to stop using the app because I don't want to have to check everything that DIDN'T happen. This could be much better if it assumes I didn't drink or smoke if I didn't make any mark for that day. Or at least give me the option to do it this way.;0
bought premium version, didn't get upgrade, sent proof of payment, still no response. not good;0
the layout was good but it only lets you track 5 habits for free;0
it's not worth the premium. I tried to get a refund because it wasn't what I thought it would be and no one has contacted me. They claim to read every single email but can't reply to a paid customer. I will be deleting this app and regretting the $8 purchase;0
well, It is good and motivational, but I don't get notifications for the reminder. Moreover, you have to pay for the widget;0
There needs to be an option on when the habit starts;0
Best habit tracker I've used so far! Very flexible, good data to work with, I find it motivating, and I love that I can chose exactly what I want to work on, right away. The price is also very very good for what it is (thank you for not making it a monthly subscription!!). The ONLY reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I love using the widgets however they are quite glitchy. For example today I have 1 habit that dissapeared from the calendar & check off list. Sometimes you can't tick off;1
Used it on & off for years. Motivational but not annoying like some. Nice design, various views (week, month, specific habit progress). Wide variety of goal options such as doing something x amount of times a week or every x day of the week or month. ALL the stats. You can set a date to achieve the goal (app recommends like 60 I think). Discussion boards. Other features as well, I just don't use them much. All in all, great app.;1
Great for tracking your bad habits, making new good ones, and building a better lifestyle for yourself. Bought the full version for more habit tracking, which is great if you are dedicated, but $7.99 is a pretty hefty price for just 100 habits, some inspirational quotes, and a mediocre social system. It has helped me better myself over the past week of using it, so I'd highly recommend trying it, at least in the limited free version before buying the full version.;1
"Looks like it's not supported anymore. Shame. I used it for about a year and really liked it. Edit - looks like it works again, no idea when it stopped being broken as no dev ever responded to my inquiries about the malfunctions. Four stars because I liked it while I used it but I have found something better (Loop). Instead of once ""per week"" you can set a goal of once per # of days. Works better for me, and is more useful.";1
Really good way of tracking habits and progress (exercise and quality of baby's sleep are my uses). Only 4 because there could be a little more on the customisation front (even if only in the premium version perhaps). I'd like to see something like a target for average number instead of pass/fail, that'd provide an extra way of approaching habits I think. I'm picking at hairs though, it's a very good app, that does the job it advertises.;1
"Tracks many tasks in great detail (statistics available on averages and streaks, etc). It has progressive tasks, so you can check on goals that are multiple times daily (like drinking water) and come up with more info than ""pass/fail"". My only qualm is the color. The display is very busy and colorful. I would also like a quicker interface for ""progressive"" tasks.";1
Great app, really nice UI, no major bugs I've come across. Feedback: Could you guys increase the character allowance for the notes please? It can be frustrating to be recording notes for a day and have it run out of space. Thanks.;1
I'm using this app since a week. Loving it so far. I think some new cool features like challenges would be fun and engaging. Will make it 5 if that happens. Besides, I recommend you to use this app for developing a new habit or skill. The numbers makes you feel good about yourself.;1
"Wonderful app! I'm just wondering if I overlooked something, because if, for instance, I set a habit to ""every 3 days"" but end up doing it every 2 days instead, the app is counting the 3rd day as a fail? Which seems very strange to me, since I actually did better than needed!";1
I love this app. I like how simple it is to use. Worth purchasing. The only thing I wish is that it would open to the weekly spot instead of to a single habit. Maybe there is way to make that happen, let me know! But if you are looking for simple but great habit tracker I highly recommend this one.;1
This has been a pretty indispensable tool for me. It motivates me to do the tasks that sometimes I would really rather not do like put in eye drops or exercise. My personality requires checklists or I'll find excuses to skip doing things.;1
A little hard to use at 1st. However, if you go through the tutorials. The app will help you develop habits. I have been using it for a month and am definitely noticing a difference. If you want to change your habits, download this app.;1
Great tracker! Wish there were more colors to choose from, especially if you have more than 8 habits you're tracking.;1
I like the app. Have been using it for a few months now, and the widgets plus reminders definitely keep me on track. Only drawback I've found is the inability to sync my profile - always fails with 'sync failed, make sure you have a working internet connection'. Have sent in support request, but so far no response. That aside, the app works well, and I can still use it in 'standalone' mode on my primary Android phone.;1
Liked the setup so much that I quickly became a premium user. The widget alone is worth it. I love the flexibility the app allows in specifying when I can work on developing a habit. As I am frequently adding habits, I would like to rearrange habits in the list to make it easier to find them. Hopefully, this is an easy fix. Then this will be a 5-star app.;1
So far so good! It does do this weird thing where it highlights a different app after I've exited the app though... bit of a weird bug.;1
A great app that helps create new habits or break bad habits. If you want to set goals, this is the app to use. Tried many of the same type of apps and this is, by far, the best & easiest to use.;1
A good starter app 4 collecting the data you need to better your daily life. Limited flexibility, in the free version, but sufficient four basic tracking of self-improvement efforts. Easy to get started. And so I can do without cute reminder and encouragement features, they are easy enough to toggle off.;1
This has been a great app to build habits. I would give it a 5 star but your limited to only 5 habits at a time. You can get more but theres a pay wall;1
Happy to see my progress. It's a great app to keep a track for my daily routines and things which I paid limited attention to create that into my regular day to day life.;1
This app seems to work pretty well. The user forums aren't well managed, but remain useful. Habit Tracker has never crashed on me, but it does have the annoying habit of changing where in the UI has focus at the time you launch the app. Fortunately its easy to navigate.;1
I love this app for easily tracking my habits to work towards personal goals. There's only two things that could make this app better: being able to disable decimals on specific habits (to count full numbers would be great as you do sets of a workout and make updating the count easier) and not losing the progress of a goal if you change the specifications to meet it (like going from doing 10 to 20 pushups a day and not losing the streak from before the change was made).;1
this is the best app I have ever used to keep track of my activities.The greatest part is that each time you feel like giving up to achieving your objectives, it will always remind you, which is very motivating. I only have one problem though,having trouble with syncronising my progress, which means if the app was to be accidentally uninstalled and then reinstalled again, then all the progress I had saved would be lost, so this one reason I give you a 4 star rating instead of a 5.Good app though;1
I have only been using this app for about six days, however I'm really enjoying it. I like that you can mess with the color scheme and the encouraging quotes. It's also affordable if you are more than five habits. One thing I think that would be absolutely amazing to have on here is a spot for goals and some kind of daily journal write. Aside from that I love it so. 🤗🤗 If it had a spot for journal writings and goals it would definitely be five ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐;1
A straightforward, no-nonsense app with a vibrant community. I've found it very helpful to start to shape my habits. Thanks to the devs!;1
Using the free version and it's easy, intuitive, and highly flexible...It reflects just what I want to track for five different tasks each week (from simple task tracking of daily meditation to more complex tasks like 3x a week business actions where I log time spent on these actions and notes too!) I've already recommended it.;1
An improvement would be to see running total on all habits page. Quite expensive for what it does;1
Havent been using it for a long time but so far so good. However, the paid version should have more features, such a costomizing your own categories. Also, the widget should be more customizable, such as font size.;1
Great app, easy to use. Custom colours and categories for each habit. Limited to 5 habits on the free version is the only gripe;1
Nice app, would like further customization for habits, such as perhaps scores, the better you tackle a habit (healthier eating today than yesterday resulting in a higher score) this would make the app much more useful for me, otherwise great app;1
It's a good app that lets us develop 5 habits if one isn't a pro user. I think it's a good idea to start small since developing a habit, just one habit, takes atleast 2 months if not mistaken. Overall satisfied.;1
Easy and convenient apps! But the setting to the habits can be more flexible it would be the best!;1
Its great and easy to use but still the developers should try to make it some sort of strict.;1
App is great. Helps me keep track of my daily habits. I like how the interface is simple and easy to use. However, I've been experiencing issues tracking my habits using the widget.;1
The best habit tracker app I've seen, would've done 5 stars, but I feel like something's missing, and I can't quite put my finger on it;1
Fun and engaging way to track your goals and form better habits. I'm still not great at keeping up with it, but the app works well when I spend the time to pay attention to it.;1
good app...but they could add something like notification bar tab or floating widget or something so as to remind us constantly to keep us in check in order to develop out habits;1
Very conveniant and useful. The reminder function is also really nice to stay on top of activities.;1
The simplicity is nice, but sometimes I want something with more detail. I use it in conjunction with another app. If I don't have a lot of time to enter info, it's great for that. I like that you can change the background to dark which isn't so jarring if you are using just before bed and are trying to avoid being stimulated by technology. I do wish, though, that you could change the setup of a Habit entered between a simple click or entering more detail. Right now you have to create a new Habit if you want to change, but then that changes your stats.;1
I've just installed this app and so far, it seems like exactly what I had been looking for! Kudos. I just have one suggestion. The app exits on pressing the back button once. Most apps exit on pressing the back button twice, which works great for the user experience, in my opinion. So, it would be really great if you could incorporate that. Hoping to use this app every day!;1
This app is literally the only thing that reminds me to take my meds. I love getting the notifications and tracking my progress so easily. However I just upgraded to the pro version specifically for the sync capability and...it does not work. -1 star. For $10, I would hope that the one feature I wanted would function like it's supposed to. I'm not happy about that at all. The home screen widget comes in handy so it's not a total loss but that alone is not worth the price. Please fix syncing!;1
It's the best habit tracker out there but it's not the best it can possibly be. After a substantial amount of thought, I succumbed and shelled out the 10 euros for the premium version to be able to use the widget, which is essential to keep me on track. However, the widget doesn't respond unless the application is opened beforehand, so minus one star for that. Also, a true black widget or user-interface would be very nice for AMOLED screens, so fingers crossed for that too.;1
"The one major short-coming of this app. (and most other ""habit trackers"") is that it does not have any option to calculate a total number (amount of hours, etc.) for a week or month--only a number of days or per day...That is a gaping deficit in these app's (with the exception of one or two with less desirable formats), as it is a far better way to track things like sleep which may fluctuate from.day to day. The other dismaying factor is that Habitbull doesn't seem to have any customer service, as I e-mailed numerous times about issues trying to upgrade (because it is a really helpful/useful application), and never got any response in about a year's time. :-\ Aside from the tabulation inadequacy discussed above--which I really hope they'll address/include that capability, it is a really helpful and useful app., and can be especially helpful for people with issues such as depression or ""OCD"" who may have difficulty keeping a handle on self-care and/or productivity (though, it could, also have the opposite effect, if people with ""OCD"" get too immersed in tracking things in their day-to-day :-S). In general, it is a good tool to have, though, and can help you make a lot of progress on things like household projects, etc., but I really do wish that they'd adjust it so that you can calculate a total for a duration of time longer than a day, and that they would also be conscientious about customer service/support and responding to/fielding correspondence and issues people encounter. ~*Kristin Star*";1
The app is good, but I think it's need better graphs and charts.;1
"This is a super cool and helpful app. I love it. My only criticism is that it could be a bit more user friendly... it's easy to set up habits you want to DO (drink 8 glasses water per day) but harder to set up ""I only want this many ___ per week"". Additionally, the funny reminders are funny... because they're ridiculous. I don't think an English speaker wrote them, but I can't convince myself to disable them because they're so strange. 😂";1
This is a great app for me. The app is easy to navigate and the motivational quotes are a nice touch. I give this app 4 stars because I have an issue with the notifications. I want the app to remind me to do a certain task a certain amount of times throughout the day, but it only sends me the notification once I open the app which defeats the purpose of the notification. Not sure if I'm the only experiencing this problem? Other than that, I use this app on the daily.;1
It's simple to use: you don't need to be a coder to figure it out. I like that there's a message board. I am considering using it to form a support group so I can stay on track with my workouts. Also, I didn't realize there are a lot of people who hate themselves for masturbating lol. But it's good they can find support in the message board. I read that you can only have 5 habits you can track. I'm being pragmatic and starting out with 4. But eventually I will need more than 5.;1
Nice configuration settings. Able to set most goals. One setting that I couldn't get to work for me was trying to get a goal for every other day. It seemed to that the goal needed to be completed every second day and comoleting it on off days didn't work. The UI is slightly un-intuitive as well. I don't think swiping up on a goal calendar should swap to another goal. It makes it hard to scroll down to the community form at the bottom if the app.;1
App is nice! It works fine. I think it might just be better if it can give some rewards (maybe points or what) whenever you exceed your goals. I also do not understand some items in the app like the red translucent thing that goes on when you tap the dates the 2nd time and why it decreases % when red. Maybe you can make the app more user friendly. I also sometimes feel offended by being catcalled by the app notifications. I don't think it's appropriate. Still, it's a great app.;1
The app is simple & clean. Tracks Habits efficiently. The only reason I am giving 4 star is because Reminder notifications aren't working properly. Habit Tracker, please fix it!;1
Easy to use and helpful to keep good habits on track.;1
i suggest a positive running tab amd also a negative running tab! i love the app and it really makes a difference in tracking my daily habits. the only thing i have found that would make it better is if i could track relapses. this would require it to allow something that i do NOT want to mark for a day amd when it is marked then it would be a negative. this would help responsibility to be accounted for the relapse. i would like these negstives to be separateky counted from the positive marks.;1
This tool really helps me see my progress so that I can feel motivated to change. When I see that I have been on a successful streak, it helps me believe that I can make positive changes for real and forever. I only did four stars because if you want to track more than 5 things you have to pay. Also, their forums seem to only feature drug and sex addicts. It's kind of creepy really...but you aren't required to participate...so I ignore it.;1
Great habit tracking tool. The widget on the home screen is a great size so I can see quickly how well I'm doing, and the options at set up are thorough. I'm tracking all sorts of things and it's easy to see how I'm doing. Highly recommended. Only concern is I'm having trouble getting a response on a _potential_ issue I have (not sure it's real yet, but if it is I'm concerned). Otherwise five stars.;1
I've had this for about 6 months now and tbh its helped me out. you're allowed 5 free habits. any more than that you have to pay but i think 5 is a great start because you dont want to bombard yourself with too many changes. its simple, easy to use...it takes awhile to form habits so be patient and honest with your entries. it'll help you see where you're failing and succeeding by %. i noticed i did habits because i didnt want to fail. now i notice i perform habits because i want to excel.;1
Great app. Just bought Platinum. My only issue is when setting my goal for a habit. Let's say I have a habit named '1 hour of study'. And I set my goal to doing this 5 times a day. Even if I would only do it twice (meaning 2 hours) each day the app would show it as a streak, even though I haven't reached my actual goal during any of the days. So it does see it as a success even though it wasn't for me. Could you maybe implement an option to make it possible to show those as unsuccessful?;1
"This app is great, closest I've found to what I want! But I wish there was an option to add ""goals"" instead of just ""habits"" and give the goals a bit more options for their completion and reminders. Sure, I want to have the habit of eating healthy lunches, but I also want to record my goal of losing a certain amount of weight over a few months. :)";1
I like this app, I have used it for a while now and it helps. Only reason for 4 stars is that the percentages are frustrating. I managed 122 days straight but it won't change from 98%. I think once you do the full 66 days you should get 100%. Also, would love to be able to highlight a day in the future as a milestone, just different colour so I can say 50, 100 days etc, as a motivator. It's great for a free app. We'll done to the devs on this.;1
Love it! Would like to see a few more details in the graphs. It would be handy if you could scroll through the weeks smoothly instead of one week at a time. The dark version of the app should be the standard imo, it looks cooler ánd it saves power! I'd love to have a timer as an option to measure the amount of time spent on a habit. Thinking of meditation, breathing exercises.;1
"Habitbull is great. I love how customizable it is for making different types of habits. Tracking my current streak is great for motivating me to keep on going. And even if I break my streak, I love that it shows my ""best score"" so I have a new goal to reach. The only thing I would suggest is having a ""user suggestions"" button in the settings. I have emailed about a new type of habit a couple times and have never heard anything back. User feedback is always good for making a great app even better";1
really effective app. best widget of all the habit tracking apps I've tried. But the widget can be a little glitchy and I wish there were a compact version. some of the UX leaves a little to be desired. I'd love to see some small improvements espec to widgets, but still definitely worth using. premium paid user.;1
Great app, easy to use, nice design, motivating statistics and quotes. Thank you developers for this app :). Only one remark from me: if I change the number of repetitions per week of an activity, it changes the whole statistics (also for the previous period). Maybe there could be an option to apply this change only to further period (e.g. when I start an activity twice a week, it becomes a habit and I want to increase it to 3 times a week and I don't want to lose/worsen previous statistics).;1
This is by far my favorite habit tracking app (and I've tried many). I like the weekly view. (I have an unusual use for this app.....I use it to track my kids' school work and I like the weekly view so I can see what they have completed during the week). However, I'm not sure if this app is still being supported? The last update was over a year ago and they do not respond to inquiries. But the app does still work well.;1
Very good and gets the job done, not the prettiest or well designed but certainly not the worst! It's exactly how it's pictured and works fabulously too. No crashing or issues here.;1
"its a good app, the cool thing for me is that you can comment per day, so if you fail with your habits you can find out what things stand in your way, i withdraw one star because i want to make a feature request: when you select ""all habits "" i also want to see all comments (mixed) this way the app would also be a holistic diary , thx :-)";1
Great motivator to keep a habit going. Also good for keeping track of habits you already have. They have great, insightful options that help you set your goal. Tried a similar highly rated app (forgot its name) and this one destroys it. Immediately uninstalled the other one. There are a few quarks here and there they can improve, but overall I really like this app and have recommended kt to friends and family.;1
It's very simple to use. I like that you can set as either a yes/no habit or a rep like two times a day. My only hangup would be that the free version only allows tracking for five habits but that can be a bonus if your just getting started. You don't want to overwhelm yourself.;1
Heyyy dear Developers..!! Love the app.. but have a issue in it.. IDK if it is only with me.. the App doesn't show any reminder after 1 day of setting a habit goal.. only 1st day it does..;1
The widgets look great, and i like the idea behind this app, but it feels like im fighting it to create goals where i would have to start over completely to make it a single task vs a quantity. also my biggest issue is that you cant set a quantity per week, only per day. i want to be able to set x number of hours per week doing a task without any daily requirements;1
Excellent app. Does everything you want a habit tracking app to do. Only complaint is the app counts the current day in your progress with no option to change that. So it looks like you are less successful than you really have been on a daily activity done near the end of each day. For example, if I am tracking going to the gym after work everyday and have been successful for 2 weeks, the app will show me as less than 100% successful until I indicate today is successful. Need to fix that.;1
I very much enjoy this app. it has helped me greatly and its easy and fun to use. There is one issue though. I do not enjoy having an app call me affectionate names such as darling and sunshine. Quite frankly it makes my stomach turn everytime this happens. I like this app so much I bought the premium version but the fact that the app was calling me pet names made me almost delete it. I plan on continuing to use habitbull but I sincerely hope this weird occurrence is changed.;1
"It is such a great app to help you manage your time! I really like the fact that it can set the reminder time in a very specific way, it is perfect for people who have a different schedule everyday. One thing to point out will be the choice of the habit. Although you can type it yourself, wont really affect anything, I would like to have more type of habit to choose except for clicking ""other"". Also, it is sad that you need to pay for back up, but it is understandable.";1
Great app... I am using it for a while... Functionality wise it the best in the market... It can get updated in terms of visuals and performance;1
I would like to set the begin date in the past, then indicate the total number of days and have app calculate end date. i would like to see the end date on calendar, number of days remaining, and an option to have days marked complete as the default. also, stop asking me to rate when i already have please.;1
the app has helped me track my habits and create new better habbits. i have been 7 weeks drinking nothing but water and have been on and off with candy and snacks. just like any other habit tracking app, this will not do the work for you. it is here to hell you keep track of the work you are putting forth, and it does a good job at that.;1
great habit tracking app and you get plenty without premium. I like the premium widgets quite a bit and the extra habits. Would be better if it had the option to flag a habit as skipped rather than fail without breaking the chain for when you can't do it. E.g. In bed early when you have to stay back late at work.;1
The tracker has a clean interface and it's simple to set up habits. I've only experienced one glitch: sometimes when you're looking at the calendar view of a habit the heading won't show up. If I could improve the app I would make the habit description show up in the habit calendar page. Right now you have to click on the habit name to view the description. I would also make an option to include skip days so if you need to skip a habit it doesn't count against your streak progress.;1
Absolutely love this app. 4 out of 5 for two reasons. One, navigation, I think swiping between habits rather than scrolling would be a better interphase and also more intuitive. Scrolling habits only goes one direction, swiping could go both, as long as you're off the calendar. Two, the free version only can track five habits. I'll probably buy the app for full access, because this truly is a good app. However just a few more, say 10 instead of 5 in the free version would've been appreciated.;1
Loved it. Motivates me to keep me on track with my set targets.;1
Pretty good at what it does, exactly what I needed. However, there is a small bug - weekly review widget does not show all my habits. Moreover, I miss a feature to periodically share my weekly/monthly reviews on social media, or with at least with someone. Accountability helps.;1
great app, I just wish one thing could change. some of my habits need a long title, and it doesnt show the full title if I click 'all habits' or even on each single habit. if the title could allow more characters, or another line, I'll add the last star! lol (please);1
Great app for succeeding with your good habits. The widgets are especially useful since you are constantly reminded if you haven't completed one of your habits. I also like the discussion page but I miss some sort of timestamp to show when the post/comment was posted. Sometimes you reply on a post that has been dead for quite a while without knowing it.;1
It is all for me about habits i wasn't able to work on it but in this one it is so helpful just i have one issue i don't know if didn't find it or it is not at the program that if u need to remind your self more than one time in the day i just remind my self once a day i don't know if it in the app or not;1
Awesome App that has really kept me on track. I just wish there was some type of reward system once you've reached your goal. I think regular reminders (perhaps with some form of motivation attached to it) would also encourage discipline and drive.;1
I just downloaded it to see the continuity of work I do. I found it personally useful. 1st : I am reminded by the large display of tracking down my habit. which I wanted to continue. 2nd : Now I can read the comments I entered after finishing the tasks. Now it is becoming habit for me to keep track on my habits that i see improvement in overall doing. i hope i still achieve lot more through this app. I heartly thank to the developers and creators of this app. signing off.;1
I love this app and the widgets are awesome. 1 star lost because I am frequently getting pop ups (about 5 a day) stating it stopped and to restart app. And there is no update available. I might uninstall if this continues and it gets on my nerves. For now, works for what I need it for.;1
I bought the premium version of this app. It is easy to use and I love the reminders sent to my Galaxy watch to keep me on track. I would like bolder colour coding to differentiate the goals being tracked and success/failure indicators. Overall a great purchase.;1
It's a great tool to start, track and keep habits. Since I started using it I've been adding more habits I want to build and this app keeps me organized and reminds me of my habit goals. I get to compete wirh myself and see where I have room for improvement.;1
I like that the app in simple. I turned off the motivational quotes, so all I see is the calendar. And that's all I need to see! One thing I would add, though, is the ability to add exception so missed days don't count against my streak. One of my goals is a daily activity that I can only do at home. When I travel, I miss those days. But I did it every day I was able (i.e. every day I was home), so it's a bit of a downer to be penalized.;1
I really love this app, it helped me quit smoking but I have a few comments I would like to make 1. the badges you receive on certain days are not saved, I think it will be more motivating when you know that you are reaching milestones 2. the discussions I posted are also not saved, I would like to see my journey posts to keep me motivated as well and to also see how other people interact with them. I still love this app a lot and really recommend it;1
Newly installed re: resolutions. Seems to be a bug on Android when I set a target date it sets it to the day after. If I go back in and change it back one day, it keeps it. Please fix. Seems like a great app. Purchased to export data because data is beautiful lol. Thank you.;1
So far, so good. I love the reminders because they check in you throughout the day, rather than just once a day. This has definitely helped me develop a routine. I may keep it on longer than the prescribed 66 days. The app claims it takes that long to develop a lasting habit but the daily reminders help me best. This app is good for that.;1
I love habit bull. I did not expect to feel connected to people when I purchased this app but that is what happened. Realising that other people have challenges with habits made me feel, alive, like I was not alone. I only wish the reminders would play on continuously like an alarm, because sometimes I forget to check things off.;1
App is very useful and is exactly what I need, I just find the layout to be a little complicated. I wish there was an option of a simple checklist of what I need to do today, but instead it's a calender layout with the full weeks of things to do. Apart from that the app is ideal;1
I like this app as it helps to track things that are important for me. I'm still exploring how effective the method is but I like what I found so far! It'd be nice to have a way to see the correlations or tendencies among habits if any. Good job, nice idea!;1
This is a very well built habit tracker. Very flexible settings and easy to use. The main downside is that the app is not being developed anymore. The Pro version is reasonably priced, although some (not me) have had issues transferring between devices. I also hear support is non-existent.;1
Useful;1
Great app, really nice UI, no major bugs I've come across. Feedback: Could you guys increase the character allowance for the notes please? It can be frustrating to be recording notes for a day and have it run out of space. Thanks.;1
So far so good! It does do this weird thing where it highlights a different app after I've exited the app though... bit of a weird bug.;1
Motivational and funny remiders really help in pushing to do the task;1
The app is good, but I think it's need better graphs and charts.;1
Good;1
Great tracker! Wish there were more colors to choose from, especially if you have more than 8 habits you're tracking.;1
Sync doesn't work;1
Best habit tracker I've used so far! Very flexible, good data to work with, I find it motivating, and I love that I can chose exactly what I want to work on, right away. The price is also very very good for what it is (thank you for not making it a monthly subscription!!). The ONLY reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I love using the widgets however they are quite glitchy. For example today I have 1 habit that dissapeared from the calendar & check off list. Sometimes you can't tick off;1
Nice app. the icon got problem.;1
Nice;1
An improvement would be to see running total on all habits page. Quite expensive for what it does;1
Good;1
Good app;1
good app...but they could add something like notification bar tab or floating widget or something so as to remind us constantly to keep us in check in order to develop out habits;1
Great app, easy to use. Custom colours and categories for each habit. Limited to 5 habits on the free version is the only gripe;1
I love this app. I like how simple it is to use. Worth purchasing. The only thing I wish is that it would open to the weekly spot instead of to a single habit. Maybe there is way to make that happen, let me know! But if you are looking for simple but great habit tracker I highly recommend this one.;1
The best habit tracker app I've seen, would've done 5 stars, but I feel like something's missing, and I can't quite put my finger on it;1
Its great and easy to use but still the developers should try to make it some sort of strict.;1
Really nice. It could have a section for addictions.;1
Very useful and encourages motivation;1
Notification features should be free.;1
Good;1
Very conveniant and useful. The reminder function is also really nice to stay on top of activities.;1
A straightforward, no-nonsense app with a vibrant community. I've found it very helpful to start to shape my habits. Thanks to the devs!;1
Easy to use, and has helped me to keep track of my good habits.;1
Easy and convenient apps! But the setting to the habits can be more flexible it would be the best!;1
Nice to track challenges, it gives it's own incentive to keep those day trains going.;1
loving it so far! keeps me motivated :);1
Good as motivation to track and tick off daily goals.;1
A little hard to use at 1st. However, if you go through the tutorials. The app will help you develop habits. I have been using it for a month and am definitely noticing a difference. If you want to change your habits, download this app.;1
Good app. No lags. Does what it says. I'm happy.;1
Happy to see my progress. It's a great app to keep a track for my daily routines and things which I paid limited attention to create that into my regular day to day life.;1
I'm a big kid. I'd love it if the circles you tap to colour in were star shaped.;1
It's a quite useful program. Works reliably.;1
If wish the images of quotes would have the previous option too;1
I like the app but dont like the big list of discussions about guys not trying to masterbate at the bottom.;1
It helps me to change my habbit;1
Simple but effective.;1
Wish it had a little more options but still great and easy app;1
This has been a great app to build habits. I would give it a 5 star but your limited to only 5 habits at a time. You can get more but theres a pay wall;1
"Looks like it's not supported anymore. Shame. I used it for about a year and really liked it. Edit - looks like it works again, no idea when it stopped being broken as no dev ever responded to my inquiries about the malfunctions. Four stars because I liked it while I used it but I have found something better (Loop). Instead of once ""per week"" you can set a goal of once per # of days. Works better for me, and is more useful.";1
Really good way of tracking habits and progress (exercise and quality of baby's sleep are my uses). Only 4 because there could be a little more on the customisation front (even if only in the premium version perhaps). I'd like to see something like a target for average number instead of pass/fail, that'd provide an extra way of approaching habits I think. I'm picking at hairs though, it's a very good app, that does the job it advertises.;1
Great tool;1
Very good quality app for habits;1
Simple yet perfectly helping me achieve my goals;1
Very Helpful app for us to quit/join any kind of habit With the help of this app i have now completed my 60 days of no smoking challenge Thankyou habit bull;1
Already helped a lot. Wish it had more colors.;1
Great for tracking your bad habits, making new good ones, and building a better lifestyle for yourself. Bought the full version for more habit tracking, which is great if you are dedicated, but $7.99 is a pretty hefty price for just 100 habits, some inspirational quotes, and a mediocre social system. It has helped me better myself over the past week of using it, so I'd highly recommend trying it, at least in the limited free version before buying the full version.;1
Good, better than the other apps;1
Good habit tracking app!;1
"Tracks many tasks in great detail (statistics available on averages and streaks, etc). It has progressive tasks, so you can check on goals that are multiple times daily (like drinking water) and come up with more info than ""pass/fail"". My only qualm is the color. The display is very busy and colorful. I would also like a quicker interface for ""progressive"" tasks.";1
Why there is different icon showing of app in play store and different on my phone pls make it same;1
Great app;1
"Wonderful app! I'm just wondering if I overlooked something, because if, for instance, I set a habit to ""every 3 days"" but end up doing it every 2 days instead, the app is counting the 3rd day as a fail? Which seems very strange to me, since I actually did better than needed!";1
This has been a pretty indispensable tool for me. It motivates me to do the tasks that sometimes I would really rather not do like put in eye drops or exercise. My personality requires checklists or I'll find excuses to skip doing things.;1
It's a little too early to tell. So far pretty good.;1
Really remarkable app.;1
Used it on & off for years. Motivational but not annoying like some. Nice design, various views (week, month, specific habit progress). Wide variety of goal options such as doing something x amount of times a week or every x day of the week or month. ALL the stats. You can set a date to achieve the goal (app recommends like 60 I think). Discussion boards. Other features as well, I just don't use them much. All in all, great app.;1
Get me focused and motivated;1
I liked this app it is really helping me and reminding me to do things on time and I am able to be proactive;1
A great app that helps create new habits or break bad habits. If you want to set goals, this is the app to use. Tried many of the same type of apps and this is, by far, the best & easiest to use.;1
Sehr hilfreich.;1
Home;1
I'm using this app since a week. Loving it so far. I think some new cool features like challenges would be fun and engaging. Will make it 5 if that happens. Besides, I recommend you to use this app for developing a new habit or skill. The numbers makes you feel good about yourself.;1
Genial!;1
Can UI can be improved to add habits with more customisation.;1
great!;1
Numerical entries should default to the previous days value;1
Easy to use and helpful to keep good habits on track.;1
C'est bon;1
Loved it. Motivates me to keep me on track with my set targets.;1
Ok;1
I love this app for easily tracking my habits to work towards personal goals. There's only two things that could make this app better: being able to disable decimals on specific habits (to count full numbers would be great as you do sets of a workout and make updating the count easier) and not losing the progress of a goal if you change the specifications to meet it (like going from doing 10 to 20 pushups a day and not losing the streak from before the change was made).;1
Bug has been fixed! Now i can use it with all my devices!;1
Great tool!;1
Using the free version and it's easy, intuitive, and highly flexible...It reflects just what I want to track for five different tasks each week (from simple task tracking of daily meditation to more complex tasks like 3x a week business actions where I log time spent on these actions and notes too!) I've already recommended it.;1
Useful app;1
I have only been using this app for about six days, however I'm really enjoying it. I like that you can mess with the color scheme and the encouraging quotes. It's also affordable if you are more than five habits. One thing I think that would be absolutely amazing to have on here is a spot for goals and some kind of daily journal write. Aside from that I love it so. 🤗🤗 If it had a spot for journal writings and goals it would definitely be five ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐;1
Good app really helpful....but i think it should include permanent tracker in the dropdown menu;1
Great to get started with a healthier lifestyle.;1
Dear Developers, When syncing will be fixed? Thanks;1
Great for keeping track of my workout and non drinking days.;1
Free and easy to track ur new habits;1
It's a good app that lets us develop 5 habits if one isn't a pro user. I think it's a good idea to start small since developing a habit, just one habit, takes atleast 2 months if not mistaken. Overall satisfied.;1
Good one, to keep up the momentum :);1
The app is simple & clean. Tracks Habits efficiently. The only reason I am giving 4 star is because Reminder notifications aren't working properly. Habit Tracker, please fix it!;1
Great!! its simple....;1
Good app to track habits;1
Animations are a bit choppy and mediocre design but great functionality;1
only 5 hapits for free;1
this is the best app I have ever used to keep track of my activities.The greatest part is that each time you feel like giving up to achieving your objectives, it will always remind you, which is very motivating. I only have one problem though,having trouble with syncronising my progress, which means if the app was to be accidentally uninstalled and then reinstalled again, then all the progress I had saved would be lost, so this one reason I give you a 4 star rating instead of a 5.Good app though;1
Easy to use but it seems really basic;1
Love it except I can't change the positive memes at the bottom anymore.;1
Great app... I am using it for a while... Functionality wise it the best in the market... It can get updated in terms of visuals and performance;1
UI/UX can be improved a bit more;1
I love it, simple and effective! Is it right that the motivational pics don't switch anymore? Mine has been stuck on the very same for a year now :(;1
i like the design;1
Heyyy dear Developers..!! Love the app.. but have a issue in it.. IDK if it is only with me.. the App doesn't show any reminder after 1 day of setting a habit goal.. only 1st day it does..;1
"Very good for starting small. I remember downloading a similar app without a limit and I was very quickly overwhelmed by the number of goals I set for myself. I like only being able to track 5, it motivates me to reach those goals as soon as I can so I can set and work towards setting more. I also love the motivational quotes under the ""All Habits"" section.";1
Really helpful if you have executive difficulty. I find it really encouraging to see the graphs and knowing that I'm making some progress. It feels like a little reward to watch it grow every time i complete a step towards a goal.;1
It's done it's job very well for me so far. It prompts me to keep it up to date using notifications and accurately tracks my habits. Be aware that the actual improvement must take place within your mind, the app can't change you. It's job is to track your daily habits and present you with accurate visual data on your progress, it does that job very Well.;1
It's so easy to use and very good in keeping me motivated. I love that it allows me and other users to create a discussion board about our journey. I also like that it shows you your progress and streaks. The colorful design also makes it fun to use. And best of all, it doesn't bother me with ads when i'm using it. I am using the free version and i feel bad that i'm not paying the developer back. I am unable to get the premium version right now but i will surely upgrade when i'm able to.;1
It's so quick and easy to use. Highly personable and perfect for anything you want to track. I have a couple habits on this app and I get to see my record or doing/not doing the habit. I can see anyone making use of this app. In a couple seconds I get my tracking done and can add notes if I want.;1
This is a great app. It makes me feel accountable - even though it's just me using it and no one else seeing the results. I've started with just 4 habits that i want to nail but I can definitely see i will be adding more. Don't get me wrong, this app is not a miracle cure, you still have to actually DO whatever it is you want to become a habit, but it has really helped me;1
This app is really helping me with personal accountability! I adjusted my goals 2-3 times in the first couple weeks (AND DIDN'T FEEL GUILTY), as I figured out how best to set goals that actually worked for me. Now that my goals are better defined and more REALISTIC, I'm encouraging myself with the progress I've made. Each success feeds into a positivity loop and I feel increasingly capable and motivated! ❤;1
Great app 😊👍 love it. Even sends me notifictaions to remind me to mark this day. Also general descussion is a good idea, its very incoraging to see other people on the app strrugling keeping habit of stuff, just makes you feel like you're not alone 👍;1
I've only been on it, the free version for a week to suss it out. So far it works great, and will keep at it for a month to see if it's perfect for my personal accountability. I like the percentage on progress aspect of this. Will need to see a more detailed chart at the end of the month to decide if it's right for me. Thanks for this. Good job.;1
My experience with this app has been amazing. For some reason, somehow, it has been the defining factor in instigating many great core habits that have greatly improved my quality of life. I couldn't recommend it enough.;1
It's not easy to form a habit or break one. But to always keep myself accountable and a good track record for myself, habit tracker is my go-to app for it. It's simple and yet brilliantly made and I thank the developer for this. Please keep at it and thank you making this app;1
Inputting your accomplishment/non-accomplishment is really quick and easy- just click or double click on the particular day. Seeing the whole month with the colour indicators for achieved/didnt achieve for each day is helpful as it's easy to gauge how successful you were that month compared to other months. The motivating messages when you accomplish your goal consistently for a period is a really nice touch!;1
I have tried so many apps but i completely satisfied with only this app.because the font sizes are larger and visually feels good this is really very useful to make what i want so i want to get premium or platinum before that the developer need to solve the drawbacks that is transfering data one mobile to another and clear the different features about platinum;1
The interface is very beginner friendly and the tutorial shows you how everything works. You can share your streaks with others to inspire and motivate them. It even reminds you everyday to use the app just in case you forgot to use it. This app is the best for quitting addictions.;1
This app is simple yet effective in helping you achieve your habit goals. Personally I have health issues which can affect my work attendance. This app has motivated me to push passed thoughts of going home sick and not giving in. As I write this I'm at 106 days without a sick day, which is remarkable for me. It gets 5 stars for this alone!;1
SO helpful in tracking my goals! I was just looking for something inexpensive and super basic but there are a bunch of features I didn't even know about that make it way better than basic and TOTALLY worth the price. Try it!;1
I have been using this app for a while, and I find it very helpful! It's really useful if you try to organise your time and force yourself to learn some new habits like workout, learning some new things etc. Thank you!;1
This is the only thing that has proved successful in getting me to workout everyday! Simple but v v effective and its always a treat being able to tick off my habit as done at the end of the day :);1
Really Good App for tracking! Easy to set, access and monitor. User friendly. With this app I can control my habits. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.;1
I use this app often, it keeps me accountable. One thing I'd add is the ability to clear all the days previously done in a single habit in order to restart it. Other than that, I still use this app daily.;1
Extremely easy to use. Only thing I'm having troubles with is I have an event that I set for 15mins a week, everytime I try and tap that its comoleted it asks me to set the new rule instead of just marking complete.;1
Great habit tracking app. The only things I think could be improved are: goal dates not automatically pushing back to match the day you edited a habit. And being able to edit how you want to track a habit if you change your mind. Maybe I missed something, but it seems like you have to recreate a habit in order to change how to keep track of it (ex. Yes/No or by keeping count with numbers). I highly recommend this tool though, it's a great place to start keeping track of habits!;1
This is a really good app. Unlike some other apps I've tried to use they've kept many features free. I will consider purchasing the upgraded features once my preliminary habits are formed. Very good app.;1
It keeps me honest. I like the motivational sayings. I just wish I could send them to myself at a certain time when I need them most. I've printed out one of them and taped it to my wall. Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps me on track.;1
Such a great way to keep track of your habits. It's great to see the progress you've done in past months too! The fact you can add notes is such a plus!;1
It really helps me to track my new habits and you will be addicted to the new habit without even knowing it. I have been using the app since 3 months and I highly recommend to those who are serious in implementing new habits.;1
Great app. You can set up your own goals in a detail way. Helps remind you of your goal but in a good way. I can stay focus and it pishes you a bit to achieve them;1
Easy to use and surprisingly motivating. I definitely recommend this for anyone looking to form and stick to healthy habits.;1
It's a wonderful app that makes it easy to track habits in various ways. It has many options that help you customize and the streak feature really drives you!;1
Great app! Love the daily reminders! Super easy to use!! I wish that you could do more than 5 habits without paying, but hey, Im cheap and developers deserve to be paid!!;1
One of the best app to develop habits. The special thing is about this app is that it provides a medium to share the experience of other fellows who are also trying to develop the same habit.;1
Love this app. Have used it for years on and off. I love how it provides motivation for real habit creation and success.;1
I have used several habit tracking apps and this one is the best. It is easy to use and I like the way it gives my percentage success rate and my streaks. A lot of the other apps wanted a monthly subscription fee. I paid for the pro version after using the free version since it was a one time payment.;1
It's a nice app. I like the reminders it sends every day. It really helps, especially at the very beginning when I used to forgot to practice.;1
Super helpful for me. Im bad at doing things in a consistent manner but this app has helped me keep track of things. Its daily reminders are also super helpful.;1
Very good app to track the progress of habits. I have been using it for last few days and found it to be very helpful.;1
Excellent app, excellent widgets. I use this with widget as my daily habit manager. Could do with an update and could have other features but what it does (help maintain habit streaks) it does better than any other app I've found. I bought premium one off to use the apps.its worth it for me. Don't usually buy subscriptions but a couple dollars once off worth it. Free to use though, only widgets are premium;1
One of the BEST apps ever invented.if your a genius that also needs to shape up I recommend this app or if you need to get more organized such an awesome app (: Update I can't wait to actually start using this to organize my life for my greater plans thank you for reminder need this 🙏🤍✨✨💯;1
Works exactly how I would expect. I like that I can track multiple goals easily.;1
I'm not the kind of person who can stay loyal to an app regarding productivity for over a few days. But I've been using this app for over 2 months. And I love it! It's great to track habits. You can customize your habits and even add daily notes. Once you're on a streak, it feels harder and bad to break the streak. This is great!;1
Very pretty interface. Easy to look back at your habits and see trends.;1
Tracking my progression on goals has never been easier! This app is so simple, yet it's amazing and I love that you can share your progression with friends for accountability. The only thing I don't understand is the various greetings/notifications they send you in different languages.;1
Helped me make a streak! I am a person who starts an activity with excitement but loses interest eventually, most likely before a week. But this app made me continue because i had to punch everyday. When i crossed 4 days it felt like I should not let it go to waste,let me continue. And then activity like drinking 3L of water everyday was easy to achieve. So when i made a one-week streak of that, the app congratulated me and built more excitement. Rest is history! 💛;1
This app is simple to use and it honestly does motivate me to form new habits. I don't want to lose my streak so I keep going and getting amazing results.;1
Awesome habit tracker, I like that you can go back in time to track a habit you've already started.;1
Its a dammm good app which can help you to build new habits and to leave old bad habits,there is one thing i want to say to dovelopers that you have done a good job,but please increase the no. of habits on which we can keep a check onn in the free mode becuse the people who are aware about themselves aware about there habits are the one who want to become something in life and are not generally silver spoon soo. please try to give some more no. of habbits to keep check upon.;1
Simple and easy to use. I'm using the free version which allows me to track 5 habits. Habits and reminders are customizable and this app has been super helpful in showing me what habits I am maintaining well and which ones require a little more effort on my part.;1
Easy to use, sleek design. Love the funny option for the daily reminders. Keeps me focused.;1
I paid for it so I could track more habits......love it. Always works good,it's colorful and motivating;1
Easy to use. Has everything I want from a habit tracker. Great app. I use it every day.;1
Simple but well designed and attractive layout that is easy to set up and use. I use it to keep me mindful of my eating and exercise.;1
The app is a great tool for tracking goals, which can keep you motivated to continue good habits, or stop bad habits.;1
Really great app. It would be great to see how much money I saved by not smoking. Just an improvement an app developers should think about :) Great job!;1
I love everything about this app! It's convenient, easy to use and it really helps me to track my habits. Just what I wanted!;1
P20 Pro Notifications weren't working but figured it was because of battery saving settings. Really enjoying app now, integration with Google fit is great.;1
It's a good app even if you don't go pro, but it is well worth the money if you do go pro. It's very simple and easy to use. Would highly recommend it!;1
Ease of use and not overly intrusive... The affirmative encouragements help me to pick myself up again... Great job!;1
Great app to track your habits. One thing I like about it that it has a lot of customization which makes easy to described our habits. It has one issue that sometimes it does not notifies of habit. Rest all about this app is good.;1
Love how it's layed out easy to use,but effective just started using it for like a week now and it really motivates you to work on the habits you need and want to improve of your life;1
It works well for building and tracking habits. No obtrusive ads or anything negative so far. Thank you developers!;1
Love it!!! Makes it so easy to track how well your doing with your habits!!;1
Very nice app, has everything required for tracking habit. Please introduce option to change unlock pin.;1
Amazingly intuitive way to keep track of your habits. Visual and assists me in moving forward in my goals. :);1
A very great and easy to use app for tracking your habits. I am really happy 🖤;1
It's very helpful application I like it. I start remark a good result and it helped me to have a new habit .;1
The app is fairly simple and works for my needs. It's also been very reliable on my Pixel 3.;1
Great app to set and keep goals. You get to set up 5 with free app which is plenty. Love it.;1
Easy to use and really helps you to notice when you are not being as disciplined as you thought you were. Great app;1
#NAME?;1
I liked this app so much I actually paid for the full version. Extremely helpful in reminding me about where my priorities should lie;1
I like the design and ease. Best habit tracker I've found.;1
Really awesome app!!! Its definitely easier than other habit tracking apps I've tried, and better designed too. I get a lot of use out of it, so I purchased the full version. If you're trying to keep track of multiple things at once, especially with the goal of remembering to do things, this will help. I have horrible memory due to health issues so I sometimes forget to do basic things, and this keeps me on track.;1
"Well, like anything this app is only as useful as you're willing to let it be.  BUT, if you are committed to either making or breaking (or both!) any habit you can think of, then this little jewel of an app can help you do that.  The idea of ""streaks"" may seem trivial to some, but we all crave this at some level because it clearly marks out your accomplishments in a tangible way.  When you see you have X days of success, you are that much more likely to overcome the impediments you may face.  What's more, this program is highly flexible in the ways you can track any given habit.  I have yet to find a habit and pattern I couldn't set up.  The app is free, although I paid for the premium version because 1) I HATE ads and 2) I liked the flexibility of data export, so just try it and you may find that it changes your life for the better.";1
Really easy to use, it even gives an overall success percentage to let you know how well you're smashing your goals! Highly recommended :);1
I use it for keeping track of tasks after I complete them. I don't want a reminder of a task,I just need to keep track of it. This app allows me to disable reminders. Keeping track of them is as easy as checking off the day. It has the days circled based on how you schedule your tasks. The user experience is really easy. You can create multiple tasks (or habits to be), schedule them separately and keep track of them on one home page. It shows you stats etc to see your progress. Those for whom the reminders cause unnecessary stress (i.e. workout reminders), this app is better than calendar scheduling.;1
By far the best habit building and tracking app I have used and I have tried many. Have been using the paid version for 6 months or more and my routines ane habits are the best of my life. You need more than an app, but having a tool like this is KEY. LOVE the flexibility, simplicity and the streak-oriented design. Thank you HabitBull!;1
User friendly. Great GUI. No bugs so far. Great app.;1
I didn't think this app was much at first, but I soon started to get into the swing of things I've been trying to get myself into for the longest time after installing. There's just something about that feeling of satisfaction when you fill in a circle for completing something. It tracks your streaks and your average progress. It also encourages you with cute quotes about being yourself and being the best you! Forming (or breaking) a habit can be done easily with Habit Bull!;1
I really like how easy it is to use, that it displays your progress in a neat and easy-to-track way, and gives you options for how to measure your success (yes/no per day, #of days per week, days you want to succeed and days you can 'cheat', etc). It's pretty satisfying to tap the little circle for a thing I did and see it turn green and link up with other days! Would definitely recommend.;1
Superb!! Possibly the best app i have ever installed!! There are a lot of things out there that claim to make a differnece, but this one really does. It has helped me develop powerful, life changing habits that i have been meaning to for a long time but struggled to make it stick. seeing the chain of successes builds a resolve to continue that is stronger motivation than I couldve ever expected. Cant recommend this highly enough - especially as there is a free version to get started with!!;1
I've tested dozens of habit and routine tracking apps. The clean layout, useful widgets, and versatility of this one puts it above the rest. Even without premium, it is highly functional. Furthermore, premium is a one-time purchase rather then a monthly/annual fee, which was a deciding factor for me.;1
Fantastic app, which works just as intended. It reminds me of the habits I'd like to track with funny messages (though you can also be notified by normal messages), is simple and motivating (when you reach milestones, etc). I prefer it to other apps simply as it's just habit tracking and not much else, unlike e.g. Habitica, which is just... too much (for me).;1
Very useful app. When seeing the streaks, we will get motivated. Awesome to use.;1
To begin with I already loved this app because it's aesthetically pleasing very easy to use and all in all just keeps me in check with the things I want to keep up with in my life, I was having issues with my phone so I had to reset and when I try to log back in I didn't have any of the data and I had purchased premium and I didn't have that anymore and I reached out to the support team and they were able to completely help me and merge my account so that I had all my data again and my premium again with no issue within just a few hours they are amazing and I highly recommend this app!!!;1
i read somewhere that the only way to know what you are achieving is to track it! i struggled a lot by making my own calendars and marking them ....also not being able to mark my progress when m away from home..! but this app.. its like you have your progress with you all the time... the percentage helps you know how much you are going to keep that resolution you made on 1st January 👍. I am using the basic version right now .. but i Guess i am going to upgrade to the premium version;1
I purchased the premium version so I can use the home screen widgets. It motivates me to stick to my habbits once I see them all the time when I use my phone. I've been using it for 2-3 weeks now and I woke up early, went to the gym, read at least 20 pages and flossed in the evening EVERYDAY. Obviously, is not all thanks to the app, but it does help to track my progress and keep me accountable if I miss anything. Just start with easy to achieve habbits to make it work long term and build on that.;1
This app really helps me keep my goals and tasks organized. I used to use sticky notes to plan out my goals but I find that using this app is more convenient because I usually have my phone with me. I can check my goals any time I want as opposed to having to bring sticky notes with me all the time. I highly recommend this app for people starting out on tracking their habits or people who are looking for a non-traditional way of tracking habits.;1
It's great so far. I can only set 5 goals on the free version, but to be honest, any more than that and I'd be doomed to fail anyway! love that you can see the chain of days you've achieved your goals - I hate breaking that streak! The charts and graphs down the bottom also offer a nice visualization of your success which I really like too. The ability to set reminders for each habit is also good as it can give you the extra kick you need.;1
Excellent app! I love the premium version. It would be nice to be able to log habits multiple times per day too!!;1
Loved it. Use it to reach and track your set goals.;1
Has really helped me track and build habbits. I have used it for a few months now, and I really enjoy the UI, the notifications are humorous (So I don't mind getting them). It's super flexible to input what you want to track and seeing your progress on the calendar is really motivational. having tried several apps like this, this is the one I reccomend.;1
This is an amazing app that helps me stay on track with all the new habits I want to add into my daily routine. I'm so happy my friend recommended me to use it! 🌼;1
The #1 Best Habit Tracking app in my opinion. You can record the amount of activities you do and see the final result at the end of week. When recording your activities, It shows your average amount of the activities done during the week . This app also keeps my life back on track and reminds me what i need to do throughout the day and its very convenient. This app is extremely easy to use and it is free! I honestly wouldnt be able to live without it. Thank you. ❤️;1
I have a serious and long standing issue with procrastinating. Started using the app in yet another bid to get me to be productive. So far it's worked a treat. :) I think the streak keeping is a big part of it, for me. It's easy to keep a habit for a few days but the longer it goes on the more expensive it is to slack off, giving you an extra push to work harder.;1
Visualizing the progress brings motivation to do the habit. It also brings a ton of organization on what you're doing and how well you're doing it. I highly recommend this app. Download it now and create the habits that will change your life for ever! A good starter is to read the bible and spend time with God once a day for a minimuofm of 10 minutes a day. It seems like a like a little. The point of this is to get into the habit of reading the bible to eventually spend hours in God's word 😀👍;1
Liked the color coded style of tracking. Green for good/success. Light red for bad/failure. What I'll love it's an hour by hour option for each day and then an option to view weekly/monthly with each marked/checked hours of each day showing in the week/month view. A long chain of greens all through. Big mental incentive to keep going on. Solid job. Keep it up!;1
Nice app ,very helpful.HT team u can also add some articles related to habit building ,those might be beneficial for someone.;1
I like the simplicity and it helps me track the progress.;1
"Super awesome! I have a tendency to run away and stop using any app or anything else that makes me feel bad when it notices I haven't done whatever it is at all, even for a few days. This just gives me a ""you can do it, let's keep going"" rather than, ""you haven't done x for 3 days in a row"". Although I know the 2nd messages is not meant to make me feel bad, it does. I love this app!";1
I like it;1
Really useful for tracking and no annoying ads;1
Does what it says it will do;1
Awesome app.;1
Keeps me reminded on my streak;1
Very nice app, has everything required for tracking habit. Please introduce option to change unlock pin.;1
My experience with this app has been amazing. For some reason, somehow, it has been the defining factor in instigating many great core habits that have greatly improved my quality of life. I couldn't recommend it enough.;1
Higher app;1
Cool App;1
I paid for it so I could track more habits......love it. Always works good,it's colorful and motivating;1
This app is supperb.....from india.🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳;1
I got a best friend in daily practice;1
Just came here after you becoming sponsor of rewirs channel in utube Well I am thanks full that I got to know about this app by rewirs (that is also a very gud channel);1
Awesome habit tracker, I like that you can go back in time to track a habit you've already started.;1
Well it works for me. Seem to be keeping up with my habit. Slowly introducing a new habit every 2-4 weeks and building up my habits.;1
Easy to use.;1
Awesome app;1
Great aoo;1
Really easy app to use.;1
A very necessary app. It has changed my life very well. Thanks for creating this app.;1
Awesome app.;1
Very pretty interface. Easy to look back at your habits and see trends.;1
I like the design and ease. Best habit tracker I've found.;1
Great app;1
Great way to track daily habits.;1
Helpful 👍;1
Easy to use and surprisingly motivating. I definitely recommend this for anyone looking to form and stick to healthy habits.;1
I 1nterupt People, I'm Stubborn, And I Am Anx10u5!;1
I love everything about this app! It's convenient, easy to use and it really helps me to track my habits. Just what I wanted!;1
Best app ever to track habits;1
This is the only thing that has proved successful in getting me to workout everyday! Simple but v v effective and its always a treat being able to tick off my habit as done at the end of the day :);1
Really helpful if you have executive difficulty. I find it really encouraging to see the graphs and knowing that I'm making some progress. It feels like a little reward to watch it grow every time i complete a step towards a goal.;1
Very good app;1
Such a great way to keep track of your habits. It's great to see the progress you've done in past months too! The fact you can add notes is such a plus!;1
This app is amazing;1
Great app, helps me to keep on track.;1

Great app! Really helpful.;1

Very good app to track the progress of habits. I have been using it for last few days and found it to be very helpful.;1
Overall Best Hebit tracker app - Need improvements in app ui [ For better touch experience ] [ Dark theme not up to mark ];1
car;1
Great and intuitive.;1
One of the BEST apps ever invented.if your a genius that also needs to shape up I recommend this app or if you need to get more organized such an awesome app (: Update I can't wait to actually start using this to organize my life for my greater plans thank you for reminder need this 🙏🤍✨✨💯;1
Works exactly how I would expect. I like that I can track multiple goals easily.;1
This app is awesome!;1
Been using this for over a year. Customizeable enough for the free version + no annoying bits. 10/10;1
It's so quick and easy to use. Highly personable and perfect for anything you want to track. I have a couple habits on this app and I get to see my record or doing/not doing the habit. I can see anyone making use of this app. In a couple seconds I get my tracking done and can add notes if I want.;1
Easy to use. Thank you so much for the app and for helping me lead a healthier lifestyle! :);1
Ease of use and not overly intrusive... The affirmative encouragements help me to pick myself up again... Great job!;1

Great app for making habits;1
Easy to use app, great for tracking habits;1
Not Free. Free upto only 5 Habbits.;1
Wonderful!;1
This app is simple to use and it honestly does motivate me to form new habits. I don't want to lose my streak so I keep going and getting amazing results.;1
Easy to use, sleek design. Love the funny option for the daily reminders. Keeps me focused.;1
Great app. Does what it was designed to do in excellence. Should they allow you to set longer term dates it would automatically double up as one of the best goal setting apps as well;1
Love this app. Have used it for years on and off. I love how it provides motivation for real habit creation and success.;1
Amazing app keeps me in check and credible all the time;1
This is such a simple to track app and has helped me reinforce some.habits which I want to make it a part of my daily life;1
I LOVE THIS APP!;1
Easy to use. Has everything I want from a habit tracker. Great app. I use it every day.;1
REALLY GOOD;1
It's a good app even if you don't go pro, but it is well worth the money if you do go pro. It's very simple and easy to use. Would highly recommend it!;1
I loved it!;1

Heavy;1

Amazingly intuitive way to keep track of your habits. Visual and assists me in moving forward in my goals. :);1
In general, it's such an useful app, of course it helps me to be more productuve.;1
Improve my quality of concentration...;1
A perfect app to keep you on track and motivated.;1
It's done it's job very well for me so far. It prompts me to keep it up to date using notifications and accurately tracks my habits. Be aware that the actual improvement must take place within your mind, the app can't change you. It's job is to track your daily habits and present you with accurate visual data on your progress, it does that job very Well.;1
"Very good for starting small. I remember downloading a similar app without a limit and I was very quickly overwhelmed by the number of goals I set for myself. I like only being able to track 5, it motivates me to reach those goals as soon as I can so I can set and work towards setting more. I also love the motivational quotes under the ""All Habits"" section.";1
I liked this app so much I actually paid for the full version. Extremely helpful in reminding me about where my priorities should lie;1
"This app will create a ""Review my tasks"" reminder when you launch it for the first time and by default will set the reminder to ""5 hours before"". This can mean it will wake you up in the middle of the night with this reminder playing a loud notification sound. It ignores the Do not disturb mode of the phone. It fails to show any visual notification so you will not know why your phone is making sounds in the middle of the night.";0
"Good app, but does not respect ""do not disturb"" mode and keeps waking me up every night. EDIT: the issue is fixed, giving the deserved 5 stars. EDIT2: this is not fixed, after all. Somehow this app not only not respects the do not disturb mode, but also manages to send notifications one hour after I fell asleep. Today it sounded around 4 am!!!";0
I like the app a lot, bit I can not make the notifications sound to work. I have enabled all notifications in setting - both the phone and the app but the only notification I'm getting is in the notification bar? Without the notification sound the app is quite useless.;0
I haven't even opened this app and it's already drained 30 percent of my battery! Wow. Waste of time and space.;0
Key functionalities of the app are hidden behind a subscription of $6.50 per month with the best deal. Simply shameless.;0
Don't offer to send notifications if you won't actually do it. That was the whole reason why I thought this would help me and it didn't. Will be uninstalling.;0
Ads too frequent, didn't even finish setting up first days tasks;0
Not very intuitive;0
I just cannot be notified. Please. Fix it. So I could give 5 stars.;0
Tested on 4 Android versions and devices: 1• Reminders only work with screen on & app in foreground (app doesn't stay in memory!) 2• Can't rearrange hero screen to move graphs to bottom. 3• Every notification 'Perform' button click= annoying popup to confirm AGAIN- can't be disabled!! 4• Needs option for notification X minutes AFTER task start/end (Users need notification to inform what to start PLUS notification option to confirm it's done (at the task end time.)) Subscibe when fixed!;0
Too complicated, wanted to use to strategize for my exam but it was to difficult to add a task.;0
UNUSABLE and BADLY DESIGNED due to being full of confirmation POP-UPS and BUGS. EVERYTHING you do or don't do in and out of the app is followed by dozens of POINTLESS pop-ups which causes the app to CONSTANTLY CRASH! e.g. there's no need to confirm notification button presses! Once there's an option to disable all pop-ups, this rating can be updated to 5 stars and all of us can subscribe to premium. Let's see if the developer is interested in fixing and receiving more subscription revenue;0
Doesn't work at all - as a developer myself, it's clear they don't know what they're doing. It should have every possible one but doesn't have ANY broadcast receivers or persistant notification to keep it alive from Android oom freeing up memory which explains no-one receiving notifications as seen in other reviews. Even when active, notifications only received upon screen on despite battery optimization execlusion or doze completely disabled with root. 5 stars and will subscripe once fixed.;0
$50 for a simple app? No thanks.;0
❌=DO NOT USE THIS APP if you need reminder notifications as they DO NOT WORK even with app visable on screen, let alone in the background! ❌=App is pointless as DOES NOT STAY ALIVE IN MEMORY! ❌=Ignore reviews from users who HAVE NOT TESTED THE APP! ❌=You cannot set a notification after task start time so NO WAY TO CONFIRM TASK COMPLETION! ❌=Widget DOES NOT UPDATE! ❌=Dev NOT INTERESTED IN FIXING- complaints still exist since app creation! ❌=Many better apps to use instead- THIS APP DOES NOT WORK!;0
Crippled version without even a way to purchase outright. EDIT: I'll be clearer. Many apps features are disabled. But there is no way to just buy the app. The only option is some ongoing payment subscription which makes no sense as this app does not provide any ongoing or backend service, it's just an app! and a simple one at that. It's like going to buy a water bottle and going to check out they take your credit card info and charge you the same price every year that you use the bottle. Bottom line, it's just a scummy business practice.;0
"Notifications don't work. It's a shame, because I wanted to buy a subscription. [EDIT] Okay, I already know what's going on. The operating system of my smartphone is MIUI. This app's notifications work when the battery saver mode is turned off. At the same time, in the application settings I have the option: ""No restrictions - battery saver doesn't restrict app's activity."" Other applications similar to this one (ToDo, habits) work with this option and at the same time enable battery saving.";0
All right so to be clear, this app is amazing and I'm really happy to see that someone has made their own version of it! Even though it's such a great program, it became unusable at day one. It had bugs and limitations that hindered what I was attempting to accomplish. Problems such as: inaccurate characteristics, no quick access from rewards to inventory, non removable default achievements, inaccurate values on skills after undoing a task and hidden xp multiplier from skills to characteristics.;0
Enough with the pop-up ads! I don't mind if an app has ads, but if I'm going to be interrupted by a 15 second video every 5 seconds while I'm checking off my list I'm deleting your app. And no, I'm not going to subscribe just because you keep popping up the subscription page. If I have to pay to make the app decently usable, you may as well require I pay for it to begin with.;0
Could be good if basic features like icons weren't locked behind a paid subscription. Update: your calling THEMES an advanced feature because you want to not because it is one.... Sorry but changing the background color to black, which it should be in the first place isn't an advanced feature, it's about one line of code. I'm a software engineer myself and know the difference between the two. Same goes for icons which are essentially to app functionality. Check out Notion for a great example.;0
It seems the app is not build for longer and more complex use. It looks like it can be used for people that plan to follow and develop their behaviour but the level of this app is of a game. Takes too long for resolving the bugs and no reaction to feedback. App crashes when using the calendar options. This should not happend when using payed version of the app. Waiting for improvement or giving up using and paying for this app.;0
"read a negative review which had a reply to someone calling out the subscription, they said all ""major"" features are available for free. No, no they aren't you can't access the calendar at all it's an entire tab on the bottom of the app it's pretty ""major"" in my book";0
app crashed after creating a daily task with 2 day habit. would fail and bring up a warning that the task failed and to press OK. however you couldnt tap ok, it just did nothing. this happened every time. gave up and uninstalled the app. on a pixel 2 XL;0
The app is amazing and has the perfect layout for a list RPG . But there's a subscription you have to pay for. Literally completely ruins the purpose of the app.;0
Decent app but repeatedly asking me to pay a monthly subscription for a fancy to-do list is completely unacceptable. Take no for an answer.;0
Too complicated UI design. I just need a mindless tracker;0
Looks really complicated, and it's entirely prescription based. I felt like I needed to take a class to learn it. There are a lot of apps like this. I'll try another one.;0
There are more effective, and honest, ways to turn a buck in the Playstore. Crippling your app with a paywall only drives home just how unnecessary the app is.;0
The app doesn't notify me when the task is ready to do. Please fix it or tell me what to do. Only when runs the app tasks work.;0
Annoying, obstructive ads. got fed up after one had a fake X button that was designed to trick you into tapping on it.;0
Too much ads appeared out of no where.;0
This app automatically downloaded when i did not ask for it. Very intrusive.;0
Super cool if you're a dude and want one of the multitude of dude avatars. If you're a woman, I hope you want to be a nun, a woman holding an umbrella over a puppy, or part of a couple. Not even kidding. Definitely a guy created this app and had an all guy panel of betas.;0
Rs1050 have been deducted from my account twice for yearly subscription but in the app its showing that i have not purchased any subscription yet;0
The pop up adverts are so loud ... Terible !;0
"DON'T download. After installation my calendar was FULL of commercials! ""You won an iPhone"" events with alarms.";0
kicks me out of the game instantly. Not for me.;0
I'm sure the dev is well intended. Just no for me. UX is terrible.;0
It takes forever to download;0
notification not working;0
Novel, but boring;0
Couldn't figure out how to set reminder times won't do anything other then am;0
This is a really dumb app.;0
Only just discovered there's a bit of a, sub didn't make that clear before sign up no chance its a cheek doing it sneekly you should be ashamed deleted;0
Is quite expensive;0
very bad experience;0
Seems like if I don't want to follow that junk on Instagram, I get - 15 points. Instant uninstall.;0
I love all the recent changes you have made - especially the ability to undo things in the history. Could you please add an option to manually reorder tasks? I would like to put mine in the order that I do them throughout the day, and none of your sorting allows that. Thanks! Update: it's been 22 months since you said you'd make drag and drop sorting an option. I see monthly updates but not the one feature that would make this app user friendly. Don't promise what you won't deliver.;0
Tasks don't update their descriptions until you quit and re-open. Can't set more than 7 tasks without paying an absurdly expensive weekly subscription;0
Crashes on android 4.4 (miui 9);0
Buggy! Won't let me edit rewards. No.;0
My entire plan was suddenly removed;0
This is worst task game in my life;0
The English used is very poor,  thus, if the developed cannot master simple rules of grammar, why should I trust them with such sensitive subject matter?  Uninstalled!;0
Somehow bought it's own subscription? Then I had trouble cancelling. Was enjoying til it stole my money. I never saw any payment authorization window.;0
Uninstall app that wants sell me every small feature  ✔DONE;0
"This app is very, very, very sexist. When you start the app up and go into the ""icon"" menu for the avatar of your ""hero"" character, the vast majority of the icons possibile to select are definitively male.   Worse yet is that all of the ones 'intresting' in thier design - or portray something such as the workplace are entirely male.  The few female icons avalible - more than half not even on their own- are showing an entirely narrow view with a subservient feeling in thier portrayal.   The developers of this app should be ashamed of such blatant misogyny.";0
I click undo but retain the XP. No real theme or this app, very bland. Needs character;0

Very useful but completely loses it's value when you don't get notifications of tasks that you need to do even though you put multiple notifications you could get one and none of the others. Other times you don't even get any I mean how are you supposed to stay on time on certain tasks when you don't even get the reminder? Please fix this problem.;0
A lot of work was put into this. I love the idea of it. I just got this, and I was looking through the app, seeing what I can do. I love the features and what you can do. You can use the app, without buying stuff but what your selling it for is crazy. $46 for one time purchase is a bit much for a task reminder. Or $10-$20 for half or full year. I love the app. I would pay for it if payment is $2.49 one time purchase. Or $12.99 for one time purchase, instead of a 6 months.;0
"So cool, but insanely expensive. Also, wasn't clear how to get started even with the manual. I have no reading comprehension issues, there is just no ""getting started"" section or similar. Then I saw the fees, $50?! WOW that is high! I hate when people gripe that they're asked to pay for apps & am a big fan of supporting developers, but $50 is nuts. This isn't a service one subscribes to, ex. Spotify, and $50 is NUTS to purchase an app. Not trying to be mean & am fine paying but $50 is way high.";0
notifiction is not working properly. When I set a task reminder when it is near finish dead line. App doesnot send me task notification about its deadline. Not Working;0
When I checklist Today's note, automatically Overdue's Note checked too?? what's wrong..??;0
I had the same problem where I started this app in the middle of intense projects and moving so I fell a couple days behind. Unfortunately skipping dozens of tasks was too time consuming and I don't like leaving a bunch overdue. I know partly it's my impatience, so I have two stars. The other is it just isn't for me.;0
Nice idea for an app but don't like the fact that you can't customize the hero to be a woman. Also think the interface could do with an upgrade for a better user experience and the app could do with a lot more refining over all to improve it. Edit - but there are no female icons.;0
One of the most expensive apps I have ever seen or tried. Everything costs money. Subscription? Check. Paid themes? Check. I mean, I spent a fortune on apps, and I am in favor of continuous support, but still. Losing my lifetime savings is just not okay. Reminds me of the app Newton Mail where they went from free to Oh My God This Is Expensive. IMO users would sub way more if the options were affordable. Sorry for 2/5 but if an app is inaccessible due to prices, I can't say that it's an ok app;0
Ok concept, but just takes way too much effort to make the core concept even work on a basic level. Kind of feels like this kind of an app needs some sort of AI with suggestions for every parameter, and sync between different devices, to get the basic functionality into usable state.;0
Annoying backup system. I've had installed this app and logged in with Google account once. I also tried some of the app's features, but I uninstalled again because of reasons. After some times, I decided to install it again. So I made my tasks and the others without logging in first (because I forgot). Then, when I logged in with my Google account after that, it replace my current data with the older one without warning. Now all my newly created, more complete data is all gone.;0
Good idea, implementation to be revised. The management of the task is not clear. The dates are showed in a confusing way. Again, the concept is good, but the user interface has to be improved and updated.;0
auto fail doesn't work properly. Subtasks don't work properly for repeated goals.;0
"I started getting notifications but all came at the same time instead of their specified times, so just removed them and no longer use. Biggest feature I would like see fixed is there seem to be issues with using the ""Today"" option for the task list Widget. Sometimes will only show one task and sometimes when I can complete all my tasks, the next day the list doesn't refresh, still says ""All tasks are done!""";0
Too complicated. I spent a half hour looking at the guide, trying to figure it out. Created new characteristics and tasks, but on the home page, there's no drop-down to choose a task. When I saw I'd have to create one every time, I decided to uninstall. Suggestion: create tutorial. No one has time for the long guide. If we did, we wouldn't need a productivity app.;0
Convoluted way of editing sub tasks and the undo button only works in te immediate moment after checking. Stats can't be reset. All the little thingd take a long time to set up due to the way interface is handled. It's also weird how 'done' can't be hidden.;0
"doesn't do what I need it to do with setting recurring alarms, such as every 3 hours forever. it just says ""how many times"" do you want this to repeat but doesn't let you choose hourly. Just daily, weekly, etc.";0
"Do you love apps that design their experience to be poor unless you pay ongoing ""subscriptions"" for static feature sets that make the experience barely tolerable? Do you prefer having money siphoned from your account over and over again instead of paying a single small fee once for an app, like we used to see? Then this is the app for you! Add one more debit to your bank account they hope you'll forget about (and statistically speaking - you will) for a stagnant app you'll forget about in a week";0
I try to set tasks for only specific days of the week, but it does Not work. After I complete the task that's it. It's done forever, doesn't repeat. Since most of my tasks need this feature to work...the app really isn't good for me.;0
Is a pretty good app but it's got a pretty big issue which is how is it going to keep track of how many things I've done every day if it counts the current activity as if it was done the last corresponding day?;0
Quite good one but I prefer single purchase option. But seriously I like the statistics. Well I saw it automatically logs out and not doing backup.;0
Calendar is a premium feature, making this pointless without a subscription.;0
I was going to give 4 stars, but the app does something kinda sleazy where it asks you what you would rate it and only redirects you to Google play if you said five stars, so I lowered it to 2 stars.;0
Confusing, over complicated, and bland looking. The fact that I had to go delete the habits that it had already chosen for me, made it worse;0
I liked it but most of intresting features was unable until you purchase them.;0
cool idea, but it keeps crashing when you try to add subtasks.;0
I'm not interested in subscriptions. One time fee would be fine by me.;0
Seemed like a great idea, could not for the life of me figure it out.;0
Price is very high for Indian users. We don't get 1/10 of what a US citizen gets paid here so there app subscriptions at such prices don't make a sense.;0
A chore to figure out;0
Kind of ha are to get the hang of. Maybe I'm just stupid! IDK!! But I never did figure it out...;0
I had to put in all the info;0
It is complicated.;0
User Interface is so tough, specially for a new person.. Even there is no guide that how to use.. On front there r those things which r not useful for a working person like those Xp and all.. Don't know how to find week date or tym for an alert.. Not impressive..;0
"Repeats tick now...however I encountered another problem. There's no way to restore ""purchases"". Meaning if you subscribe and than reset/wipe the app or your phone, you can't use the subscription features anymore. And to get it back you have to completely resubscribe.";0
The ads on this app are cancerous and the subscription model for this type of app is ludicrous. Charge a single flat rate.  If the style does change to flat rate/ad free I'll gladly change my review.;0
I really like the application so far. Great interface and feature set. I'd really like to see and would even do an inapp purchase for would be a much larger icon set. I think being able to group characteristics and skills would be awesome too. Even better if the group can collapse. It would also be cool to see a health bar that represents the amount of time you have in a day to be productive. Have it decrement as time passes and maybe make it adjustable for how much time you have in a day i think another tasklist app does that. Overall a great application, I hope you continue working on this application.  Edit: The app is still decent, but taking away the option to just remove ads for a one time price in favor of subscription only has made me decide to stop using this application and change my previous 5 star rating to a 2 star rating.;0
By default, before the current update was rolled out, tasks were set to the date 'today'. Now they are being set to Feb 1, 3880. How weird!;0
So you reskinned LifeRPG? What's different here?;0
I really liked the app but suddenly from nowhere all of my data were gone. One second they were fine then when I connect to the internet, it's back at lvl 0 with the Johnny avatar.  It seemed that there was no way to get my data back. Dropbox saved data seemed to have been overwritten so idk what to do. I feel betrayed being immersed in the apo then suddenly left hanging with the fact that I don't even know what caused it.;0
This app is an excellent idea, if only it worked. I have been unable to move off the home screen without it crashing. Its a shame as it has a lot of potential.;0
Refreshing tasks is a nightmare;0
Not a movable app;0
This is not an rpg!?!?!?! This is a goal tracker with an avatar. Ffs. So Useless.;0
Needs a dark mode.;0
auto fail doesn't work properly. Subtasks don't work properly for repeated goals.;0
Very useful but completely loses it's value when you don't get notifications of tasks that you need to do even though you put multiple notifications you could get one and none of the others. Other times you don't even get any I mean how are you supposed to stay on time on certain tasks when you don't even get the reminder? Please fix this problem.;0
Nice idea for an app but don't like the fact that you can't customize the hero to be a woman. Also think the interface could do with an upgrade for a better user experience and the app could do with a lot more refining over all to improve it. Edit - but there are no female icons.;0
A lot of work was put into this. I love the idea of it. I just got this, and I was looking through the app, seeing what I can do. I love the features and what you can do. You can use the app, without buying stuff but what your selling it for is crazy. $46 for one time purchase is a bit much for a task reminder. Or $10-$20 for half or full year. I love the app. I would pay for it if payment is $2.49 one time purchase. Or $12.99 for one time purchase, instead of a 6 months.;0
I had the same problem where I started this app in the middle of intense projects and moving so I fell a couple days behind. Unfortunately skipping dozens of tasks was too time consuming and I don't like leaving a bunch overdue. I know partly it's my impatience, so I have two stars. The other is it just isn't for me.;0
Seemed like a great idea, could not for the life of me figure it out.;0
Calendar is a premium feature, making this pointless without a subscription.;0
Good idea, implementation to be revised. The management of the task is not clear. The dates are showed in a confusing way. Again, the concept is good, but the user interface has to be improved and updated.;0
Ok concept, but just takes way too much effort to make the core concept even work on a basic level. Kind of feels like this kind of an app needs some sort of AI with suggestions for every parameter, and sync between different devices, to get the basic functionality into usable state.;0
When I checklist Today's note, automatically Overdue's Note checked too?? what's wrong..??;0
"So cool, but insanely expensive. Also, wasn't clear how to get started even with the manual. I have no reading comprehension issues, there is just no ""getting started"" section or similar. Then I saw the fees, $50?! WOW that is high! I hate when people gripe that they're asked to pay for apps & am a big fan of supporting developers, but $50 is nuts. This isn't a service one subscribes to, ex. Spotify, and $50 is NUTS to purchase an app. Not trying to be mean & am fine paying but $50 is way high.";0
A chore to figure out;0
notifiction is not working properly. When I set a task reminder when it is near finish dead line. App doesnot send me task notification about its deadline. Not Working;0
I had to put in all the info;0
One of the most expensive apps I have ever seen or tried. Everything costs money. Subscription? Check. Paid themes? Check. I mean, I spent a fortune on apps, and I am in favor of continuous support, but still. Losing my lifetime savings is just not okay. Reminds me of the app Newton Mail where they went from free to Oh My God This Is Expensive. IMO users would sub way more if the options were affordable. Sorry for 2/5 but if an app is inaccessible due to prices, I can't say that it's an ok app;0
Confusing, over complicated, and bland looking. The fact that I had to go delete the habits that it had already chosen for me, made it worse;0

"I started getting notifications but all came at the same time instead of their specified times, so just removed them and no longer use. Biggest feature I would like see fixed is there seem to be issues with using the ""Today"" option for the task list Widget. Sometimes will only show one task and sometimes when I can complete all my tasks, the next day the list doesn't refresh, still says ""All tasks are done!""";0

Annoying backup system. I've had installed this app and logged in with Google account once. I also tried some of the app's features, but I uninstalled again because of reasons. After some times, I decided to install it again. So I made my tasks and the others without logging in first (because I forgot). Then, when I logged in with my Google account after that, it replace my current data with the older one without warning. Now all my newly created, more complete data is all gone.;0
cool idea, but it keeps crashing when you try to add subtasks.;0

"Regarding the last review, I noticed that multiple widgets of different lists lead to the ""emptied list"" glitch happening more often. Unrelated, but I really love the idea of the new batch action feature. Just wondering why I can't use it to batch fail or batch perform more than one task? I expected that to be the point, but only batch delete and batch skip are available. Batch fail would help with one of the biggest issues to making the app fast to use, which is that failing takes like 3+ taps";1
I love this app, its helped me quite a bit. I would love to provide 5 stars, but I'm having issues with no notifications even though I have them active and the widget is a bit fussy clearing randomly when I finish a task. I really hope these get fixed because then this will be the single most useful app I've ever used.;1
For me is One of the best ways to do stuff and feel like it has some sort of meaning.;1
Perfect for me, takes some serious investment to set up proberly, but absolutely worth it. However, the impact of skill increases on characteristica is not calculated properly and totally different percentages turn out with the same fraction of exp (or identical numbers with a totally different fraction of the exp). Further more, when i use a task that gives me 100 exp, my herolevel gets stuck at 90/25 and doesnt update anymore. If these minor bugs are fixed, i will provide the 5th star.;1
I have enjoyed navigating my way around the set up so far, definitely worth a subscription for the full experience. Shared it with friends but unfortunately it's only available on Android. One major issue though is I can't select the quantity to use for consumables. If you decided to put in 1,000 credits in there, you'll have to click 3,000 times to use it. Takes the fun out of it. Also, wish it had a web page version like Habitica so everyone can share the experience regardless of their OS.;1
"It seems good but there is no way for me to increase the ""art"" category. Music and drawing are not the only forms of art. Please change this. Maybe change art to ""crearivity"" but certainly add more creative pursuits so those who cannot draw or do music can increase it. Also aren't erudition and learning really the same thing? My conclusion is that this app is great but needs a lit of work.";1
I absolutely love this app. I am using for a couple weeks and it is really helping me with my tasks. I tried similar apps and they're not quite as good. Tasks are highly customisable and gives tons of options. So why not 5 stars? Well, there are some issues, but please take them as constructive criticism. 1. It is not respecting the silence mode. 2. Steep learning curve. (Worth it though) 3. Auto failing task with subtask is not working. I will promptly give 5 starts when #1 is fixed!!!;1
This app is almost everything I want. I just wish there was more of an RPG element. I played Habitica and it didn't quite scratch that itch either. Maybe something like small quests that utilize text and dice-rolls that can be improved based on your level in different categories. I'd enjoy the hell out of that, and would happily pay for expansions, additional quests/stories, etc.;1
Strong fallout/ skyrim feel. But full buy price is 45$? Even those games' price are lower on sale. And I bought them on sale. Other sold apps price are usually below 5 dollars. And the default free theme has nice green background but paid ones only have bright white background?? I don't sub apps I buy them.Sub is for something like Netflix and Spotify...;1
This app is very good for keeping on task, and everything is totally customizable. One thing I would improve is the simplisity of it. Right now, it's a bit too much to handle, and if there was an easier way to do things, it would make this app even greater!;1
"I am liking it, the subscription model is a bit steep and harsh, especially for the full buy out at 50+ dollars. A suggestion, I'd like to see two categories under the ""Skills"", one that says ""Increasing"" and one that says ""Decreasing"". I am trying to set up a ""Daily Grind"" negative skill that decreases ""Will Power"" and ""Motivation"", while increasing ""Submission"" and ""Routine"". I've noticed the Dev team is really good at responding, so I am hopeful for a response. Thanks!";1
Really awesome app, I think the best one. The only it lacks web version, since it takes kinda complicated process to create and manage all this tasks and habits. With web version it would be much easier.;1
I've really enjoyed the app and has been very helpful. although to me the app seems like it's not fully finished. I wish the stats you were building actually did something in game. the money also seems kind of pointless. I can buy items that I create but they just adjust your stats which I could easily accomplish through tasks;1
App has definitely improved since my last review! more social features would be really cool. i am subscribed and i would love to see where this app takes off. i have noticed recent stability issues when i'm on the app for a prolonged period. not sure if it's related to the amount of tasks i have, as i use this app for basically all my tasks, including birthdays. the app will slow down and nearly crash after awhile. otherwise, this is still my go-to! 4 stars again!;1
The app is allready great. The amount of customisation is surreal and with a bit of tweaking you can really make it work. The sentimental value you create this way really helped me grow. As the app is rpg themed, those elements could be further enhanced imo. I think a customisable character would be fun. More options to spend the currency other then personalised awards is what im getting at. This way you really build something with the effort you've put in. For the games.. Keep up the good work;1
I like this app, but it really annoys me that it defaults to playing a chime when you first pick up your phone in the morning. When just checking the time, I don't want to be woken up even more. I wish it were possible to just disable that notification instead of disabling all sounds from the app at once.;1
Good App. Lots of customization. But i have noticed an issue with repeating sub-tasks. If a subtask is set to repeat, it won't complete the main task. Seems to complete fine if the subtasks are not set repeat.;1
I'll give it five stars when the widget stops resetting to nothing after I alter things within the app. I have to delete it off of my screen and put it back on in order for it to update.;1
This is a great app for anybody needing some extra motivation or a way to organize their life. I've had some trouble editing or deleting reoccurring tasks, but this may be a device issue, I'm not sure.;1
I think it's a great app, and a lot of fun. I had some trouble figuring things out at first, but everything works. The only complaint I would have is the cost... It would be nice to have some of the features, but they are too expensive.;1
Haven't used it much but so far I enjoy the idea. I would like to suggest adding a notification every so often option. For example, I'm wanting to do 12 pushups every hour, every day, 10 hours a day.;1
"It's a great app and very useful, but I would like for it to add an options. ""Delete after completion."" This means it would repeat until you hit the check button.";1
Slightly Intuitive, should have a tutorial. Other than that, loving it since I love rpg's!;1
Some integrated examples would be nice also an inventory of items to help pick rewards but I have no income so I have to miss out on the good stuff;1
"Hi. I love the app. There's a bug that I want to share. I created a daily task (once a day) but it doesn't go away after completing it from ""Today's"" task. What do I do? Thank you";1
add check system, count system ( how many times) and timer ( count down and count up).. then no need to use other apps...Tnx;1
I really like the app. I'm having an issue though where the widget doesn't populate when a new day starts. I have to delete it and readd it or restart my phone.;1
It's a good app, looks polished and nice. Only problem I have is I have some tasks that repeat themselves even after I complete them, I've editted that they only come once a day but forever stay on the today tasks;1
Nice app. Bug with achievement exp gained. It only adds on to current hero exp without leveling up eg( 144exp/25exp ). Why does skill decay even after doing a task that increases it?;1
It is a lot better than the other apps out. An 8 or 16bit UI makeover would be dope. The pixel look and feel. Always nostalgic;1
Great creative idea that does help keep me on track. I've also used it to start new good habits!;1
Great, but have some issues with the tasks list widget. No way I can complete a task on it without its disappearing;1
Tasks in All tasks group is frequently disappearing & reappearing so kindly fix that bug otherwise app is great;1
THE POP-UP AFTER U CONCLUDE A TASK IS VERY EXHAUSTIVE. IF U TAKE OFF THESE THE APP WOULD BE PERFECT. AND ALSO IF U STAY A DAY WITHOUT DOING THE TASKS, THE APP GOES CRAZY AND STOP PLACING THE TASKS CORRECT;1
Works as expected but I would like for time customisation to be more flexible and precise;1
Good app. Minus a star as you cant manually sort task lists with your finger and change their priority that way;1
Great idea, really creative and love thr preset activities that offer guidance;1
"Add ""negative habits"" which when done decrease coin, xp etc.";1
Really a fun and somewhat complex habit tracker to have. Recommendation : you could include some fantasy quests and creatures and some kind of algorithm that uses the skills I made to be used in finishing the quests and fighting creatures, maybe like dice roll mechanics. Would be fun to see your skill in use, cos just building them up isn't enough. Good job, add this quest system and its a complete app. Also app generated loot too...;1
app has improved a lot since initial launch and it's still my go-to for my daily tasks! still hoping for more social features in the future. also, there is still the lingering issue with a surprising amount of battery use, i think it's still related to the amount of tasks i have (i have a very busy schedule), and it causes my phone to overheat. keep up the good work!;1
A bit underrated. It's a fun way to get things done, kind of like having a video game character. It does take time to set up and some unnecessary options cost money, but it makes getting stuff done feel more rewarding. Good app for parents to set up for their kids as well so they are more motivated and enjoy getting chores, homework, etc, done. :-);1
Personally, taking the time to translate my every task into RPG format is tedious. Pretty time consuming in terms of customization. It's more like an RPG Maker, but to-do style. It's not what I'm looking for but given the developers perspective it's excellent for what it's worth. Flexible, extremely customizable and full of possibilities. Suggestion: allowing to download other users formats they've already taken the time to create.;1
This app is great! I love the idea of turning my daily life like an RPG game. But I have this goal to wash my face twice everyday and it feels repetitive to make two task for the exact same thing. So can you guys make a task where it has to be done twice before the said task is completed? Been trying my hardest to do this on your app, even finished reading the user guide, but it still wouldn't work.;1
Love the way this app is helping me. Its Great feature is the way we can track our own progress because of reward system. 4 stars only because of app's free theme.;1
I really enjoy this app because it stops me from sitting on my butt 24/7.;1
It's pretty nice all things considered, but I have found a few problems with it. mostly the fact that the notifications do not work and by that I mean no matter how many notify alarms I set, none of them go off. I've downloaded this app on several occasions in the past and I've had the same problems each time. The second is that the widget will (quite often) display that I have no tasks when I in fact have about seven on any given day. I'm not taking a star off because of the widget though.;1
I really like it. I think it's a really cool concept to have characters to build up with the habits. Only thing I wish were there is to be able to have notifications for term less habits;1
It's a great app, keep up the good work! It has almost all features I've ever wished for in gamification. But a few things were missing/quite annoying for me and lead me to abandon this app for now. If it helps you I could write you a comprehensive list of enhancements and features that I think could make this app better. Here's not enough space for that, though. Please give a short answer of you'd like me to send you an email with the list of my thoughts. :);1
I downloaded this game in the Hope's that the format would help me with my procrastination and can I just say, its exceeded my expectations. it's so good ! I ended up having to change some of the pre set tasks and rewards to make it more personalized but apart from that, it's great. highly recommend if you, like me, like to procrastinate and make excuses to avoid tasks.;1
I was looking for an organizer app which would provide statistics on my discipline and progress, and this does it! But it is missing one, to me basic, feature - the tasks don't have a start time or duration period, there is only a deadline. It doesn't allow understanding easily whether the tasks overlap in time. Is this feature available in the premium version at least? Another missing feature is the location setting, at least at a home/work/outdoors level. Any plans to incorporate the features?;1
Good concept. But I don't use the app anymore. as someone who is now not really a gamer, the point game-like concept seems to doesn't work for me anymore and maybe it's also due to the fact that I only compete with my self. if I were to compete with a friend or whoever that is, maybe I can keep my self accountable. But that's it to it. If you are a gamer, this app might gonna help you.;1
A very good rip-off of LifeRPG—taking all of the useful features of task management, reward motivation, and RPG-style stat levels, and making the UI simpler and more user-friendly. Seems to be monetizing the idea though, putting in ads and lots of in-app purchases and requiring a RECURRING payment subscription rather than one-time purchase to unlock features;1
Notifications fixed. App keeps getting better. I'd like to suggest being able to use habit generation as an unlock condition for achievements. Edit: Nice :D Another thing I would suggest is add the date when an achievement was unlocked (example: unlocked 01/04/2019) so we can also order them by this date when looking the unlocked tab. Thanks for this app!;1
"This app is really good. I want to suggest to that the app should have a ""Rest Day"" option or something similar. That you can activate it anytime you want and while activated, the tasks will be put into a halt including penalty and overdue. It is useful if you are on vacation or there's an occasion you need to attend and makes you unable to finish the daily tasks.";1
Fantastic app but 4 stars. Every part has been a comfortable experience for me until I started trying to use it across devices. I took me around 30 minutes to set up all my tasks the first time and when I signed into my account for the app all the tasks I had made got overwritten by the default tasks from the other device. It was partially my fault for the careless order that I signed in on the devices. But perhaps my issue could have been avoided entirely if when it attempted to sync my tasks from the internet the first time it asked me if I wanted to use the database that is from the internet or that is local. Would have saved me a lot of headache remaking all the tasks again. That said every other function provided is great and I would recommend.;1
Pretty good, only issue I noticed is that if you undo claiming a reward that has its price increase each claim it can give you extra coins back. Aside from that, a lifetime purchase option would be nice (I try to avoid subscriptions where possible, so I'm sticking with using this for free for now), and an option to hide the parts that require a subscription instead of showing them but asking you to pay when you click them would be nice. (e.g. so the calendar doesn't even show up on the bottom).;1
I've been using this app for some weeks now. There are still some features that I don't understand and there's just so much available for customisation that it's overwhelming. But, once i spent a few hours customizing all i wanted, this app has been so fun and useful. Most to do list apps out there are so cumbersome and anxiety inducing. This one isn't. It has helped me prioritize what's important to me while letting me role-play. I like it a lot.;1
I just started but really like it so far. Competes directly with Habitica but less of the nonsense costumes. It's hard at first to sort characteristics, skills and tasks (you are essentially your own game dev) but on paper I recently sorted out what I want to improve (Skills) and what is stopping me (Characteristics). Tasks will follow soon after. I'm really hopeful about this setup, I love the design, and I never do this but I might actually pay for a subscription (!!!) if all goes well.;1
The app is good and in general highly customizable, but it has one flaw: it uses days (24 hours periods) as a basic unit of measure, but it doesn't let you change the default starting hour (midnight). This is inconvenient for people who have unusual working hours and it makes the app impractical to track daily tasks for users who are more productive at night. I would rate it as a 5 stars app, if I could choose when my day ends and be able to log my dailies properly.;1
Its a good app for everyday tasks. It takes time to customize it and its normal because its an RPG type. However I think im not the only one who encountered this annoying bug where if you want to change a task from lets say termless to always repeat every day the task remains termless. You can solve this problem by deleting the task and making another with the setting you want. This bug was very frustrating because i thought i did something wrong but yeah..;1
Looks cool and I like the stats. I would like to have a monthly and yearly calendar display on which dates with non-repeating tasks scheduled are bold or otherwise highlighted, or preferably have the tasks listed in small font in the box for that day in monthly view. And when you click on the date have all tasks for that day display. Why do none of the life rpg apps I've tried not have calendars? It's bothersome to add something to a calendar and then open up another app and add it in again.;1
You add execution note but when I check in history it just one word that appeared, and the next is ........, I confuse how to check the details. Hope the next update, there is detail preview when tap a mission that's done in history. And also search feature in history will be very useful to check some mission among all those missions in history. Thank you for great app.;1
Perfect for people who want to get organized and desire an app more robust than a checklist. It has profound customization ability. The reward system is more complex than competitors. For someone with significant attention issues, this has really helped me to feel invested. Subtasks and autofails are great features. Would be 5 stars if developers: 1. Allowed subtasks to renew as collapsible tasks not just tied in 2. Made tutorial/videos. Full functionality will be a learning curve for many;1
"Productivity gamefied! As has been said before, the natural successor to LifeRPG. Looks like they just ripped the source code tbh, but it irons out many of its predecessors bugs. Pity they monetised it in every available orifice, fukugly full screen ads, in-app purchases for trivial customisations and an absurdly extortionate subscription, all conspire to overshadow the app itself, as does the uninspired graphic design and the use of unexciting headings that detract from its ""gaming"" USP.";1
So far so good. I love creating my own adventure. Still learning some of the functions. Maybe a tips video could help. I can't wait to see what other fun things can be added. More community or friends list. Or leader board. Then get us to do in app purchases for new items or level streaks. I just like this a bunch. So thank you!;1
"I bought the full version. its a fun app to challenge yourself. I would like to see an update gives you the choice to choose a pen or pencil icon or a book icon, which seem to be missing, that would be useful. for example, if you want to write a book, it would be nice to have a ""book""📚📗📘📙📓📔icon, or ""pen""🖋🖊 icon, or ""pencil"" icon... UPDATE: I seem them now! Thanks for responding and letting me know. Looks like I needed to scroll farther down to see them. 👍";1
This app looks to carry the torch from the now abandoned LifeRPG app and from a bit of digging so far I'm impressed. Some things are tucked behind a pay wall such as the calendar and aesthetic additions like themes and icons but it's a relatively low price and helps support the devs so I'll probably bite on that once I've set up everything and used the app a bit. One suggestion I'd have is to implement geotagged triggers for events - like bringing up a reminder when I'm near the gym or store.;1
Great app for setting up to do list and setting skills, very similar to LifeRPG, differing only in UI and the addition of achievements in my opinion. Stuck with the other one of the basis of not wanting to pay a subscription for an app. Would prefer one off payment to unlock features.;1
It's helpful, but it's also annoying. Edit: I didn't make it clear enough, it's annoying to realize how much I'm failing lol Anyway the app is pretty good I'm just overly sensitive and self criritcal;1
"It's a good app but can be better I want the developer to fix the following please: 1-when you work with it sometimes it becomes laggy and you need to force stop and restart the app 2-when you type in it in Persian the symbols like ""?, (,), etc"" doesn't align correctly 3 - if you add some native calendars like Persian calendar to it it will become more useful (and also an option to set it as main calendar not like Google alternative calendars that show Gregorian months not Persian months ex.)";1
I like this app. I only used it for 5 mins and there are no adverts that ruin your experience. I hope that the developers will continue working on it so that the app will be improved. I would consider paying for the premium features too if the app is good enough.;1
this is pure magic juat saying best life app out there keep up the great work!!! im ao happy you listen to your customers EDIT: now my entire household is using this app its amazing magic easy to use only thing i noticed is that when you claim a reward if it has an increasing cost sometimes it will spend the gold after the increase instead of before resulting in extra gold loss my best guess is that the script might be changing the cost value before subtracting the gold from the players gold.;1
It's a bit hard to set everything up, but it's a fun new concept for the typical agenda that encourages you a bit more to achieve your goals through a rpg style. Nice work dev team. Thanks for your time and effort.;1
Just after I looked at the interface I knew it was what I was searching. Not so for the xp thing which is a very great idea but also how it handle goals like reading books... For anyone who think in terms of goals (and obviously who love RPGs) It's totally free though;1
one thing, the widget sometimes doesn't update the today list, and about the to do list, i have to make 2 different widget for today and tommorow, because when all tasks show, cannot differentiate what today and tommorow so i was check list my today and tommorow task, and it is kinda confusing how to uncheck again (?) maybe this option to check and uncheck must be there, and the reward will be given after all the task has done for today.. thank you, hope this app improve;1
It is a cool app, but the calendar feature required to be bought. That should be informed to the users before installation. In addition, it would be a good idea if skills can increase over time, and skills can decrease characteristics.;1
"A good app in general. I would love to be able to have ""loose"" tasks, for example: practice spanish twice a week. Which should be completed at least twice every week. Also, why not allow icons to be any emoji?";1
It's a lot of fun, good personalization. I have to make time to explore the app called more fully, I think a tutorial would be amazing, and pre-developed lists that could be tweaked.;1
it would be nice if there are pre-set goals or task to choose from - while the app allow for a high level of customization, it's too much hassle to set it all up properly, not to mention balancing the reward from each task;1
I love this app. I only wish it had a sort of multiplayer for families to connect accounts.;1
I liked the app very much, I signed up and so with the hope that my to do list would sync with all devices. But when I reinstalled the up after cleaning my phone, everything disappeared. 😢;1
Fun way to track and reward yourself guilt-free. Lots of personal calibration but the interface is nice. My only problem is the lack of icons even in the premium section.;1
Awesome app to keep your life on track. Would 5 star, but app crashes every time I try and add a custoum sound. Edit: Thank you! Will try again after the next update.;1
Hello! Your app is amazing! My GF and me installed this app 2 days ago and started to planning task to each other. But i really need a list functional, like add a shopping list or some book list to add in this app. Are you going to add this? Sry for my English, btw:) UPDATE: And i really need a functional to add a checklist in tasks with possibility to mark it's completed. Thank you and your team again for this great app!;1
definetly a 4 star. good app, good concepts some bugs, not really pulling me in thou. i forgot about it, which was sort of the point of the app to make me not forget it. so 4 stars.;1
Great honestly great way to keep track of daily tasks to stay organized. One thing they should add is overall goals. And tasks leading to those goals.;1
It٬s one of the best liferpg apps i have ever seen with lot of options but it can have some more beautiful transparent widgets and if you add an option that a task directly influences a characteristics it can be more comfortable;1
It keeps reminding me even after the Task is done and it was adjusted according to how many times I should be notified. But overall nice app.;1
Liking it a lot so far, but I don't get it doesn't give a warning ring before tasks I put in. That's kind of the main thing I need it for - to remind me of tasks I had previously put in.;1
Hello. This app is great, but I have a suggestion. With the inventory items, please make it so you can give them attribites such as +10% xp gain or +10% gold gain, or just +10% xp for a specific skill.;1
This would have been a 5 star to app if it wasnt for one miner problem I didn't like. You can't choose PM or AM times and it's just a annoying and confusing.;1
Its really useful i really wish it had a way to add people so you could submit tasks for eachother, or a way to access it on a computer or browser.;1
The apps are functioning well and recommended trying for RPG theme if you love RPG 👍but there is a problem where sometimes when i added the task it does not appear at the task section and sometimes it becomes duplicate..;1
I like it, and I would definitely pay £20 for it, but I cant justify paying a subscription. if only I could pay once.;1
This app is great overall, I just wish there were categories for your inventory items and that the task list widget showed your profile icon also, the profile icon has very bad quality when you choose your own :/;1
Nice. Will be better if app has got inhabit counter.. for example count of pushups or exercise. I need it, but app is very nice. I will be recommend it.;1
For me is One of the best ways to do stuff and feel like it has some sort of meaning.;1
Really a fun and somewhat complex habit tracker to have. Recommendation : you could include some fantasy quests and creatures and some kind of algorithm that uses the skills I made to be used in finishing the quests and fighting creatures, maybe like dice roll mechanics. Would be fun to see your skill in use, cos just building them up isn't enough. Good job, add this quest system and its a complete app. Also app generated loot too...;1
"Regarding the last review, I noticed that multiple widgets of different lists lead to the ""emptied list"" glitch happening more often. Unrelated, but I really love the idea of the new batch action feature. Just wondering why I can't use it to batch fail or batch perform more than one task? I expected that to be the point, but only batch delete and batch skip are available. Batch fail would help with one of the biggest issues to making the app fast to use, which is that failing takes like 3+ taps";1
I love this app, its helped me quite a bit. I would love to provide 5 stars, but I'm having issues with no notifications even though I have them active and the widget is a bit fussy clearing randomly when I finish a task. I really hope these get fixed because then this will be the single most useful app I've ever used.;1
Allows me take some of the real life out my responsibilities.;1
Really really, I'm struggling a little bit with some details, but I'm loving so far.;1
Some integrated examples would be nice also an inventory of items to help pick rewards but I have no income so I have to miss out on the good stuff;1
Bom;1
So far so good, trying to get in to it.;1
Tasks in All tasks group is frequently disappearing & reappearing so kindly fix that bug otherwise app is great;1
Love the way this app is helping me. Its Great feature is the way we can track our own progress because of reward system. 4 stars only because of app's free theme.;1
Perfect for me, takes some serious investment to set up proberly, but absolutely worth it. However, the impact of skill increases on characteristica is not calculated properly and totally different percentages turn out with the same fraction of exp (or identical numbers with a totally different fraction of the exp). Further more, when i use a task that gives me 100 exp, my herolevel gets stuck at 90/25 and doesnt update anymore. If these minor bugs are fixed, i will provide the 5th star.;1
I love this app. I only wish it had a sort of multiplayer for families to connect accounts.;1
This app is almost everything I want. I just wish there was more of an RPG element. I played Habitica and it didn't quite scratch that itch either. Maybe something like small quests that utilize text and dice-rolls that can be improved based on your level in different categories. I'd enjoy the hell out of that, and would happily pay for expansions, additional quests/stories, etc.;1
Really awesome app, I think the best one. The only it lacks web version, since it takes kinda complicated process to create and manage all this tasks and habits. With web version it would be much easier.;1
"It seems good but there is no way for me to increase the ""art"" category. Music and drawing are not the only forms of art. Please change this. Maybe change art to ""crearivity"" but certainly add more creative pursuits so those who cannot draw or do music can increase it. Also aren't erudition and learning really the same thing? My conclusion is that this app is great but needs a lit of work.";1
Strong fallout/ skyrim feel. But full buy price is 45$? Even those games' price are lower on sale. And I bought them on sale. Other sold apps price are usually below 5 dollars. And the default free theme has nice green background but paid ones only have bright white background?? I don't sub apps I buy them.Sub is for something like Netflix and Spotify...;1
add check system, count system ( how many times) and timer ( count down and count up).. then no need to use other apps...Tnx;1
This app is very good for keeping on task, and everything is totally customizable. One thing I would improve is the simplisity of it. Right now, it's a bit too much to handle, and if there was an easier way to do things, it would make this app even greater!;1
I have enjoyed navigating my way around the set up so far, definitely worth a subscription for the full experience. Shared it with friends but unfortunately it's only available on Android. One major issue though is I can't select the quantity to use for consumables. If you decided to put in 1,000 credits in there, you'll have to click 3,000 times to use it. Takes the fun out of it. Also, wish it had a web page version like Habitica so everyone can share the experience regardless of their OS.;1
I'll give it five stars when the widget stops resetting to nothing after I alter things within the app. I have to delete it off of my screen and put it back on in order for it to update.;1
I love this app and use it on my Android phone. Now I have an iPad and cannot find this app for it. Is there an iOS version available?;1
Good.;1
THE POP-UP AFTER U CONCLUDE A TASK IS VERY EXHAUSTIVE. IF U TAKE OFF THESE THE APP WOULD BE PERFECT. AND ALSO IF U STAY A DAY WITHOUT DOING THE TASKS, THE APP GOES CRAZY AND STOP PLACING THE TASKS CORRECT;1
Great idea, really creative and love thr preset activities that offer guidance;1
in primo luogo, adoro... voglio dire, una lista che mi faccia giocare ed avanzare di livello come in un rpg... non posso fare altro che adorare tanterrimo in secondo luogo: probabilmente esiste un modo per impostare orari per le attività (lezioni, cose così), altrimenti non avrebbe senso poter impostare un allarme, ma... hem... io non ho idea di come si faccia (help me please) cosa numero tre: ho provato a cercarne una versione adattabile per pc e non sembra esserci... sarebbe bellissimo se ci fosse e (magari) fosse sincronizzabile ultima cosa e poi la pianto: esiste un modo per creare traguardi composti da più traguardi? mi piacerebbe avere un megaobbiettivo laurea composto dei vari esami... o campagne composte di varie sessioni...;1
Slightly Intuitive, should have a tutorial. Other than that, loving it since I love rpg's!;1
app has improved a lot since initial launch and it's still my go-to for my daily tasks! still hoping for more social features in the future. also, there is still the lingering issue with a surprising amount of battery use, i think it's still related to the amount of tasks i have (i have a very busy schedule), and it causes my phone to overheat. keep up the good work!;1
I absolutely love this app. I am using for a couple weeks and it is really helping me with my tasks. I tried similar apps and they're not quite as good. Tasks are highly customisable and gives tons of options. So why not 5 stars? Well, there are some issues, but please take them as constructive criticism. 1. It is not respecting the silence mode. 2. Steep learning curve. (Worth it though) 3. Auto failing task with subtask is not working. I will promptly give 5 starts when #1 is fixed!!!;1
Personally, taking the time to translate my every task into RPG format is tedious. Pretty time consuming in terms of customization. It's more like an RPG Maker, but to-do style. It's not what I'm looking for but given the developers perspective it's excellent for what it's worth. Flexible, extremely customizable and full of possibilities. Suggestion: allowing to download other users formats they've already taken the time to create.;1
Great, but have some issues with the tasks list widget. No way I can complete a task on it without its disappearing;1
Great creative idea that does help keep me on track. I've also used it to start new good habits!;1
It's a good app, looks polished and nice. Only problem I have is I have some tasks that repeat themselves even after I complete them, I've editted that they only come once a day but forever stay on the today tasks;1
Good app. Minus a star as you cant manually sort task lists with your finger and change their priority that way;1
I've really enjoyed the app and has been very helpful. although to me the app seems like it's not fully finished. I wish the stats you were building actually did something in game. the money also seems kind of pointless. I can buy items that I create but they just adjust your stats which I could easily accomplish through tasks;1
It is a lot better than the other apps out. An 8 or 16bit UI makeover would be dope. The pixel look and feel. Always nostalgic;1
Haven't used it much but so far I enjoy the idea. I would like to suggest adding a notification every so often option. For example, I'm wanting to do 12 pushups every hour, every day, 10 hours a day.;1
A bit underrated. It's a fun way to get things done, kind of like having a video game character. It does take time to set up and some unnecessary options cost money, but it makes getting stuff done feel more rewarding. Good app for parents to set up for their kids as well so they are more motivated and enjoy getting chores, homework, etc, done. :-);1
"It's a great app and very useful, but I would like for it to add an options. ""Delete after completion."" This means it would repeat until you hit the check button.";1
App has definitely improved since my last review! more social features would be really cool. i am subscribed and i would love to see where this app takes off. i have noticed recent stability issues when i'm on the app for a prolonged period. not sure if it's related to the amount of tasks i have, as i use this app for basically all my tasks, including birthdays. the app will slow down and nearly crash after awhile. otherwise, this is still my go-to! 4 stars again!;1
This is a great app for anybody needing some extra motivation or a way to organize their life. I've had some trouble editing or deleting reoccurring tasks, but this may be a device issue, I'm not sure.;1
Works as expected but I would like for time customisation to be more flexible and precise;1
It been running kind of slow when you're making new tasks;1
"Add ""negative habits"" which when done decrease coin, xp etc.";1
Nice app. Bug with achievement exp gained. It only adds on to current hero exp without leveling up eg( 144exp/25exp ). Why does skill decay even after doing a task that increases it?;1
It's helping me the way i think;1
"I am liking it, the subscription model is a bit steep and harsh, especially for the full buy out at 50+ dollars. A suggestion, I'd like to see two categories under the ""Skills"", one that says ""Increasing"" and one that says ""Decreasing"". I am trying to set up a ""Daily Grind"" negative skill that decreases ""Will Power"" and ""Motivation"", while increasing ""Submission"" and ""Routine"". I've noticed the Dev team is really good at responding, so I am hopeful for a response. Thanks!";1
I really enjoy this app because it stops me from sitting on my butt 24/7.;1
It's helpful, but it's also annoying. Edit: I didn't make it clear enough, it's annoying to realize how much I'm failing lol Anyway the app is pretty good I'm just overly sensitive and self criritcal;1
Homescreen widget would be nice with more display option such as the progress bar.. etc;1
Good App. Lots of customization. But i have noticed an issue with repeating sub-tasks. If a subtask is set to repeat, it won't complete the main task. Seems to complete fine if the subtasks are not set repeat.;1
I like this app, but it really annoys me that it defaults to playing a chime when you first pick up your phone in the morning. When just checking the time, I don't want to be woken up even more. I wish it were possible to just disable that notification instead of disabling all sounds from the app at once.;1
"Hi. I love the app. There's a bug that I want to share. I created a daily task (once a day) but it doesn't go away after completing it from ""Today's"" task. What do I do? Thank you";1
Awesome;1
I really like the app. I'm having an issue though where the widget doesn't populate when a new day starts. I have to delete it and readd it or restart my phone.;1
I think it's a great app, and a lot of fun. I had some trouble figuring things out at first, but everything works. The only complaint I would have is the cost... It would be nice to have some of the features, but they are too expensive.;1
The app is allready great. The amount of customisation is surreal and with a bit of tweaking you can really make it work. The sentimental value you create this way really helped me grow. As the app is rpg themed, those elements could be further enhanced imo. I think a customisable character would be fun. More options to spend the currency other then personalised awards is what im getting at. This way you really build something with the effort you've put in. For the games.. Keep up the good work;1
This app is great! I love the idea of turning my daily life like an RPG game. But I have this goal to wash my face twice everyday and it feels repetitive to make two task for the exact same thing. So can you guys make a task where it has to be done twice before the said task is completed? Been trying my hardest to do this on your app, even finished reading the user guide, but it still wouldn't work.;1
I really like it. I think it's a really cool concept to have characters to build up with the habits. Only thing I wish were there is to be able to have notifications for term less habits;1
The app is good and in general highly customizable, but it has one flaw: it uses days (24 hours periods) as a basic unit of measure, but it doesn't let you change the default starting hour (midnight). This is inconvenient for people who have unusual working hours and it makes the app impractical to track daily tasks for users who are more productive at night. I would rate it as a 5 stars app, if I could choose when my day ends and be able to log my dailies properly.;1
Turn life into a game! Create your own tasks and assign value to them! Pretty cool eh?;1
Nice. Will be better if app has got inhabit counter.. for example count of pushups or exercise. I need it, but app is very nice. I will be recommend it.;1
It is a cool app, but the calendar feature required to be bought. That should be informed to the users before installation. In addition, it would be a good idea if skills can increase over time, and skills can decrease characteristics.;1
Great honestly great way to keep track of daily tasks to stay organized. One thing they should add is overall goals. And tasks leading to those goals.;1
This app is so robust, I love it! However, I would love a quick add button in the notifications.;1
I just started but really like it so far. Competes directly with Habitica but less of the nonsense costumes. It's hard at first to sort characteristics, skills and tasks (you are essentially your own game dev) but on paper I recently sorted out what I want to improve (Skills) and what is stopping me (Characteristics). Tasks will follow soon after. I'm really hopeful about this setup, I love the design, and I never do this but I might actually pay for a subscription (!!!) if all goes well.;1
Perfect for people who want to get organized and desire an app more robust than a checklist. It has profound customization ability. The reward system is more complex than competitors. For someone with significant attention issues, this has really helped me to feel invested. Subtasks and autofails are great features. Would be 5 stars if developers: 1. Allowed subtasks to renew as collapsible tasks not just tied in 2. Made tutorial/videos. Full functionality will be a learning curve for many;1
Looking forward to a better UI/UX. Will keep using it.;1
Just after I looked at the interface I knew it was what I was searching. Not so for the xp thing which is a very great idea but also how it handle goals like reading books... For anyone who think in terms of goals (and obviously who love RPGs) It's totally free though;1
Its a good app for everyday tasks. It takes time to customize it and its normal because its an RPG type. However I think im not the only one who encountered this annoying bug where if you want to change a task from lets say termless to always repeat every day the task remains termless. You can solve this problem by deleting the task and making another with the setting you want. This bug was very frustrating because i thought i did something wrong but yeah..;1
COMPLETE! A tip: The task option directly reduces the characteristics rather than just the ability;1
I would love to do a one/life time purchase for this app. Too bad I hate subscription based so sorry, I'd rather spend my money for something unproductive than this app.;1
I was looking for an organizer app which would provide statistics on my discipline and progress, and this does it! But it is missing one, to me basic, feature - the tasks don't have a start time or duration period, there is only a deadline. It doesn't allow understanding easily whether the tasks overlap in time. Is this feature available in the premium version at least? Another missing feature is the location setting, at least at a home/work/outdoors level. Any plans to incorporate the features?;1
The app has a way of motivating you to complete tasks.;1
It keeps reminding me even after the Task is done and it was adjusted according to how many times I should be notified. But overall nice app.;1
Treating activities like a game Gives me a sense of accomplishment when I successfully finish my duties and earn XP.;1
Awesome app to keep your life on track. Would 5 star, but app crashes every time I try and add a custoum sound. Edit: Thank you! Will try again after the next update.;1
I've been using this app for some weeks now. There are still some features that I don't understand and there's just so much available for customisation that it's overwhelming. But, once i spent a few hours customizing all i wanted, this app has been so fun and useful. Most to do list apps out there are so cumbersome and anxiety inducing. This one isn't. It has helped me prioritize what's important to me while letting me role-play. I like it a lot.;1
"It's a good app but can be better I want the developer to fix the following please: 1-when you work with it sometimes it becomes laggy and you need to force stop and restart the app 2-when you type in it in Persian the symbols like ""?, (,), etc"" doesn't align correctly 3 - if you add some native calendars like Persian calendar to it it will become more useful (and also an option to set it as main calendar not like Google alternative calendars that show Gregorian months not Persian months ex.)";1
Pretty easy to use and reliable. Still trying to figure out the ins and outs, but it's been fairly easy to pick up.;1
Good;1
The apps are functioning well and recommended trying for RPG theme if you love RPG 👍but there is a problem where sometimes when i added the task it does not appear at the task section and sometimes it becomes duplicate..;1
Very interesting application just to complicated for me;1
Hello. This app is great, but I have a suggestion. With the inventory items, please make it so you can give them attribites such as +10% xp gain or +10% gold gain, or just +10% xp for a specific skill.;1
Nice;1
This app looks to carry the torch from the now abandoned LifeRPG app and from a bit of digging so far I'm impressed. Some things are tucked behind a pay wall such as the calendar and aesthetic additions like themes and icons but it's a relatively low price and helps support the devs so I'll probably bite on that once I've set up everything and used the app a bit. One suggestion I'd have is to implement geotagged triggers for events - like bringing up a reminder when I'm near the gym or store.;1
Jibj;1
it would be nice if there are pre-set goals or task to choose from - while the app allow for a high level of customization, it's too much hassle to set it all up properly, not to mention balancing the reward from each task;1
It٬s one of the best liferpg apps i have ever seen with lot of options but it can have some more beautiful transparent widgets and if you add an option that a task directly influences a characteristics it can be more comfortable;1
definetly a 4 star. good app, good concepts some bugs, not really pulling me in thou. i forgot about it, which was sort of the point of the app to make me not forget it. so 4 stars.;1
fun and productive;1
Pretty good, only issue I noticed is that if you undo claiming a reward that has its price increase each claim it can give you extra coins back. Aside from that, a lifetime purchase option would be nice (I try to avoid subscriptions where possible, so I'm sticking with using this for free for now), and an option to hide the parts that require a subscription instead of showing them but asking you to pay when you click them would be nice. (e.g. so the calendar doesn't even show up on the bottom).;1
"I bought the full version. its a fun app to challenge yourself. I would like to see an update gives you the choice to choose a pen or pencil icon or a book icon, which seem to be missing, that would be useful. for example, if you want to write a book, it would be nice to have a ""book""📚📗📘📙📓📔icon, or ""pen""🖋🖊 icon, or ""pencil"" icon... UPDATE: I seem them now! Thanks for responding and letting me know. Looks like I needed to scroll farther down to see them. 👍";1
easy to use and good at keeping me motivated throughout the day;1
Crashes when I customize my hero status;1
I downloaded this game in the Hope's that the format would help me with my procrastination and can I just say, its exceeded my expectations. it's so good ! I ended up having to change some of the pre set tasks and rewards to make it more personalized but apart from that, it's great. highly recommend if you, like me, like to procrastinate and make excuses to avoid tasks.;1
Hi, I just started using this app a few days ago and I'm absolutely blown away. It's kept me on track for a bunch of my activities and the UI is so customisable while being clean. I have a minor suggestion about if progress bars to recurrent activities can be added? Eg. I'm reading a book and have that as a recurring task but I'd like a slide bar to be able to advance my progress daily. Subtasks don't show in the widget as well. This app is still amazing and great work on everything so far!;1
This is the best, most customizable, app around. I appreciate the dev for being on top of responding to feedback and such. The app has grown over the years, and it keeps getting better and better with quality of life changes. It's actually spoiled me from installing other similar style apps again simply because I can just make everything to my taste all in one app. It really makes keeping a schedule feel like less of a chore, and for a gamer like me, that's golden. Real life questing is fun!;1
Such a good idea. Very generous to help us out for free. Helps me recognize my accomplishments instead of dismissing them and losing track of how much progress I'm making. Would recommend having essential daily tasks pre-scheduled so that they're easy to tick off the list but writing in unique events only AFTER they've been accomplished in order to maintain intrinsic motivation, memory, and your capacity to self-monitor. Use this to record progress, not replace internal self-determination.;1
Great app. I am trying to find an application like this one for a while. If you are looking for an app that will help you grow, this is the one for you. You have multiple skills to choose from. Also, you can create your own. I love that they had programming, and an Icon of Python to choose. To get the full features you need to purchase the application. However, you don't need to buy or watch annoying adds to use the application;1
The best app you can find of this kind. It is well built, creative and regularly updated. With this app you don't need any other planning or to-do list apps. It is completely worth buying. I gladly payed full price for this high quality app.;1
Only complaint is how often it asks you to rate it. Other than that, the app is even so great IMO that it's work buying the subscription. I love how customizable it is. For sure one of my top 5 favorite apps.;1
Everything is able to be modified. You can gamify whatever you want of your day a day life. It would be nice to sort tasks as you wish, just moving them in the order you want without needing to rename them or other tricks to put them in the order you like. However still being quite good for everything it offers;1
Very fun app. Lots of customization and a very polished app. Some features are blocked unless you pay(calender and some icons). They aren't needed to enjoy the app though. Can't complain, it works great reminding and motivating me to get stuff done. :);1
Awesome app overall. It would be great to see some kind of progress functionality inside tasks. For example counter 0-10(or any other number you input) for push-ups / book pages / words learned etc.;1
Great app, let's you customize pretty much anything you want to create your own system. Only reward app I kept coming back to. Has helped me to create change in my life.;1
I'm having lots of fun. I feel motivated to do more in the day. So far I have had no adds and the free version has everything you could need. I just hope it will work for me long term!;1
Life is like a video game. The free version: very detailed organization with a clean look, but well worth the time it takes to figure out.;1
This app is brilliant! Clean, simple, and ultimately customizable. I've been wanting something like this for a while!;1
It's pretty cool app, very convenient to customer everything. And really immerse into the game which is your life;1
It really feels like I have a tabletop character sheet for myself, and I didn't even know I wanted it until now. The skill and stat customization is incredibly deep. The reward system is great. I highly recommend the premium, if you can afford it. These devs deserve it, and the calendar is a nice bonus on top of all the aesthetic additions.;1
This is cool, I'm on my first day and just put in all my major daily goals like exercising and reading. You can customize the traits that are rewarded by each activity, as well as penalties for failure. You can even link customizable titles to your level progression (my personal goal: Archwizard of the Order of Ptolemy). Very few features are locked behind the paywall, and everything that is essential is free.;1
I LOVE this app. I had tried Habit RPG and I liked the generalized idea behind it but wished it was more in depth & video game like, that you could not only lvl up but gain skill points, this is extremely detailed, even has characteristics you can lvl up as well as skills & allows for complete customization in everything. Being a nerd & someone who lacks discipline, I forsee this to be an extremely useful tool to help me stay on task, achieve my goals and feel like I am ACTUALLY lvling up IRL!!!;1
Amazing app!! You can literally modify EVERYTHING into the way you prefer! It's a little complex but with only minutes you can understand it's interface and fall in love with it. I love it even more because you can go up levels and it makes really more fun doing your tasks! No ads and almost everything for free. Pretty amazing!;1
"First of all it's an excellent app. I like the fact that it is highly customizable. However, I'd like to make a suggestion. Your app lacks the ""emotional"" aspect a bit. I suggest to add support of small custom avatar-like images to the tasks instead of monotone colored icons. This way a task will associate with something positive/inspirational. Pressing on a task could then show a larger version of the image in the task view screen. Do not understimate the power of visual associations.";1
Love the app, it's much fun, engaging, and helpful to stay focused on your goals and developing new habits. Much better than competing apps (Habitica comes to mind) even if they have better social integration. Of course one can always add new features and improve design elements, but if you are looking for a task manager look no further. This is the best on the market. Highly engaging and fun to interact with.;1
I like it! I waited purposely almost 3 weeks in order to give here a true opinion. This application is amazing because it has so many possibilities, like everything is open for you, you can set anything. This is why I recommend to whom wants to use it, to take the time to understand as it works. Read the user guide included in the app so you can set the application to your exact goal. So at the beginning it may not so clear, and maybe there are more friendly use apps, but this one in adjustable;1
"Awesome app to gamify tasks. I've been using it for 3 months and I love many things about it. I won't write them because I can only type 500 characters. BUT I wish it could include ""time tracking"", like the one from Toggl. Also I strongly wish it could have a desktop version (and IOS). Another thing would be to sincronize with a google calendar, not only the one inside the app (I also think the calendar needs accuracy). Lastly being able to interact with other users and a ranking would be great.";1
Overall very good. U can edit the skills and characteristics u want and edit the rewards as well. I just want to suggest: can u add a feature where we could interact with other users or create a group according to the skills and characteristics that we have. In that way, we can also get rewards for our grp and loose our stamina/ health if we wont be able to do task. These will trigger us more to participate. :) ill purchase the calendar soon if school will be back. Thanks!;1
This is an amazing app. You're able to customize almost everything to what you want. There are some things I'd love to see added, though. Some way to have an item reward you with money would be nice, and being able to have a task directly award you with an item, too. Developer(s), if you see this you have done an amazing job, I'll be getting the in app subscription soon to support you.;1
I've only had this app for a couple of days but it's already helped me so much! I've tried a LOT of planner-type apps but I never felt motivated to follow through with them. This app allows you to make schedules and tasks, and it has a reward system in place! I've had a hard time focusing with all this online school stuff, but my productivity has shot up due to this app :) definitely worth a try. Thank you devs!;1
I love this app. It has so many features and I love the creator listens to the app's reviews. That's rare, and when it happens, I have to give props to the creator. If there is a feature I would like, it's items that can change your current photo (temporarily). This app is a 10 🌟 app and I highly recommend it;1
Life changing app. For someone who loves RPG game so much like me, making myself the avatar in real life helps much to change my own attitude to work and lifestyle. My only comment is to allow description for every hero statuses. And maybe in the future, the icon will look more appealing with colors. Also, for premium members let them be able to have several heroes at once. This will inspire people to work on different aspect of their life more closely. Thank you for makin such an amazing app.;1
This app is great. I was using different methods to change myself and they all failed but this RPG style game which I can even customize has proved to be most efficient.I would like the app developer to add some more stuff like new acheivements at different levels and getting access to more functions as we level up.😊(it will make app more interesting instead of getting more and more boring every time);1
Out of all the RPG themed productivity apps out there, this one has certainly met my needs. To whoever who comes up with the idea and design of this app, you certainly created a miracle for a guy like me! Thank you so much for creating this app, dear developers! P.S. I'll be giving this app a proper review one day, after a few weeks / months of using this! :) Till again, you've certainly created a great future for me, through this app man! 😭;1
Really loving this app! I've used a couple other productivity apps but this is the first one I've really stuck too. Turns out failing tasks and losing points really motivates me. Was wondering if it's possible to get bonus points for completing tasks in succession? Think it would help with habit formation. Otherwise does everything I need it to and really happy with it, great job!;1
If you see this Taras or other developers, I believe your app would benefit immensely and more people will download it if you were to implement an online feature or a way to access on any device such as a computer. If you would upload a website with this apps interface and sync to the cloud, more people would be able to access it, meaning more profit which would mean more great reviews, etc. If you were to add this feature like Habitica has, I, and more people, will likely buy the subscription.;1
It's a really great app I love most that it reminds you about your tasks since I tend to forget a lot especially feeding my pets and watering my plants it's easy and fun to use especially with the reward system I think it would be challenging if the app had personal rewards for say keeping up with your tasks for a large period of time and all but honestly I love the app it's perfect you can personalize it to whatever you want or need;1
It's a really great app. Although it would be better if you could use costom icons for tasks and rewards and it would be better if the app didn't blur low quality pictures (as I like to use pixelated pictures). I also love the fact that this app works offline. Thank you for the great work 👍;1
Just installed this yesterday. Loved it. Love the concept. Love the design. Too bad the free version can't have access to the calendar 😝 but otherwise, it's a great app. Am gonna give it a go for another few more weeks before deciding to commit to premium.;1
Great app which has everything I need! It's not very easy at first, but the result it gives is worth the effort. I like that you can see your characteristics in a diagram and how customizable everything is. Thank you!;1
Great app. Could suggest rewards that fit the task type, offer actual customer / icon customization, and allow linkage of tasks to overarching goals that have separate rewards attached. Other than that - best app like this I can find - a lot of great features.;1
"Great app! It really helps me to get things done. I have a few recommendations to make. It would be great if we could edit the stats of our hero. For example I want to lose/gain weight. I'd be nice if I can change the weight of my hero and have achievements for that. Also, it'd be nice to toggle the ""success level"" of each task. Let's say I have to do my homework. If it turns out that I did them with no mistakes I can get more XP and/or reward.";1
Been using the app for a couple of weeks and have lost 4lbs already. Took a bit of setting up with the tasks and rewards but it is very customisable. Gamifying my life might be just the thing I need to get into better habits and lose some weight!;1
Great app if you keep it to a short list of achievable habits, fun to use, good statistics for tracking progress, you can input things retroactively if you forget at the time, has dark theme, customization options when it comes to tasks, skills, and characteristics. Lightweight, easy to use. Overall I don't think I have any complaints, it delivers what if says it does well, no more, no less. Tldr: love it.;1
Excellent way to gamify your personal habits, with many levels of customization so you can set the difficulty levels of tasks as well as the level of self improvement those tasks provide.;1
There were times when I actually wanted to create an app exactly like this and wished something like this existed, and now I accidentally discovered it and I'm really amazed that it's way better than I could ever create. I just wished for one more feature. Doing some tasks for me is not just doing or not. Sometimes doing something more could be better. For example running for 1 hour or 2 hours? And then it could give more xp for doing something more, or give less xp if you didn't do it enough.;1
One week of use & I purchased a subscription. I've used other similar apps, I enjoy this the most. There a few improvements needed, so I need to add suggestions to the Reddit page. I spent time & wrote out what I value in life, what my aspirations are, & then I narrowed down a few simple goals to reach those aspirations. Then I added my goals to this app. So far it's easy to keep track of my goals, habits, & how I'm doing. It's incredibly easy & even fun to use. Thank you for this app.;1
SO USEFUL!! I struggle with ADHD on a daily basis, I can never remember to do simple tasks and things like notebooks, whiteboards, stickynotes, alarms, they just Don't Work. But this app helps change the game dude!! It's a clever way to incentivize completing tasks, and it's helping me build better habits with the reminders and penalties for not completing it if you miss it. SUPER USEFUL!! I feel more productive and motivated to get my tasks done, I'm grateful this app exists;1
This app is so cool! It's geared towards complete configuration from the user, so give your goals the time they deserve and map it out. Once you get through learning the app, it will be an awesome tool for your future development!;1
I've tried several RPG To-Do lists, but this one is the best out of them all. It contains all of the features you need to motivate yourself to get off your butt and do something in your life, especially during this period of quarantine. Read the user guide in settings after installing to understand how it works, and get to it! A big Thanks to developer for their quick responses.;1
This app is fantastic. There is so much personalization you can put into the alarms, skills you can build, rewards you get for completing tasks, and so so much more. This app can honestly help so many people. Once you figure out how to make everything work for your personal needs, it can do so much. Please give it a shot.;1
I've played games all my life and found using this task-reward system, something I can relate too. It helped me structure my life so I can get the most productive and happy moments out of it, with the ability to add and takeaway tasks that are not so healthy or important at that time. Just remember you choose your path, so just take it a day at a time and keep working at.;1
I am a vanilla habitician, but that game failed to serve it's purpose several times and I eventually quit. I linked it to several systemic errors. I was even thinking about creating my own habit rpg free of those but then I found Do It Now. Not only it answers all of my concerns it even adds more features, like drawbacks for completing certain tasks (anti-procrastinator) or putting player in position where he has to maintain his characteristics. Amazing, thank you devs. Please port it to web.;1
"My favorite habit-gamification app so far, after trying a few. Definitely minimalistic compared to Habitica, but it makes up for it in just being more functional, and with a much better system for attaching relative value/importance to various habits/to-do tasks/etc. All habit apps face the fact that it's hard to put actual numbers to how much a good habit should be ""worth"", and that scoring points you set can feel a bit like digging up treasure you buried. Do It Now handles it all well, tho";1
It has everything you truly need with a degree of complexity, besides it's versatile. Liberty to do many things. Thanks for the app. NO ADDS. Seriously. Congrats;1
*request* (setting day start & end time, e.g. 3am not 12am) Extremely cool idea, and a phenomenal execution! This is like a gamification on being a healthy human. There are SO many little details that really make this app shine! I love that it is not on the head with the mental wellbeing that it is promoting, it just makes it seem like a fun game! To expand on the gamification of it, I think a secondary app with little mini games where your character and it's stats and skills affect the game!;1
Aww man glad I found this!!! Love rpg games and this is a great incentive to get stuff done, just wish the full version wasn't almost 60 bucks or a subscription fee... Lil much for a reminder app;1
Probably the best task managing app out there.;1
Why nobody said about the app missing a FAIL TASK button?·It's been so hard and time consuming to just fail some tasks. It's the best app from this category, besides this minor flaw.;1
I LOVE this app. I've always had a hard time with planners because I just couldn't see the point, but that allows me to plan and have fun. I feel like I'm constantly playing a video game, but the main character is me! It has definitely improved my life! Thanks a ton, developers!;1
I like the idea behind this app and getting something that replicates the feeling of success when you level up in a MMORPG. It is fairly intuitive to figure out how to set up your goals. I like how you can tailor your avatar and level names to make it unique to you.;1
Great for keeping track of my progress in art and setting goals and rewards for myself for hitting certain milestones. The only thing that is missing is the formulas for how much xp is needed to get to X level. Had to figure this out myself using a bit of algebra. Please put this info on the wiki page!;1
LOVE this app! Especially how each task, habit or goals entered, have the option to categorize them in independent groups & it all tracks everyday via graphs. Example: GOAL- Read 1 book a week Subcategory - Discipline Only downside (but 100% still worth 5 star rating) is can't receive notifications of any alarms set on an Android tablet. Played with all the system settings and settings in app (including 🔋 reduction in battery optimization along with lock screen settings..etc);1
I enjoy this app because I am a task oriented person and I can see how much I have completed and the XP gaming quality to it makes me feel like I m reaching for a goal with immediate gratification not just doing work;1
This is by far the most useful and customisable Gamify your life app. It also focuses on skills and character building, which is my favorite part and mostly missing with comparable apps. Takes a bit to get into it, but it's definitely worth it :D;1
After reading Reality Is Broken a couple of years ago I have tried every app out there to gamify my life and nothing has really cut it. I preferred filling in hand drawn skill boxes on a whiteboard! Until now! This is the one! I love it! Thank you so much!;1
Best life rpg app that I could find. Support is very helpful and fast at responding. Everything other app I tried was all about them milking money. But not this one.;1
This app is amazing! You can customise your tasks and give yourself rewards in a shop. It really boosted my productivity and helped me get through the tasks that were a bit harder. Highly recommend this app, especially at this time!;1
As a fan of rpg's, and a slacker who needs encouragement to do things besides play video games, I have to say this is the greatest app ever. It's so much fun.;1
Fun app that has helped me keep on top of the tasks that I tend to forget about. Using a reward system works really well. With everything going on it is easy to forget about the little things and this app has helped me remember. Great job!;1
I actually want to complete tasks and see how much I can level up each day! I love it! Its a game now, not a chore :D;1
I love the developer still active and it's apps getting better. But, i want to get icons but it's must be subscription. I want to one time purchase, but it's is expensive.. I want to buy part by part.. Like in theme i can buy separately the theme that i want. I want the same with the icon..;1
Very cool app. Using it for real life stuff as if it's a video game is so fun. Could have some bug tweaks and possibly an overhaul for the interface, but it's still close to perfect and runs great.;1
Easily the best task manager app out there, while the rpg aspect is a HUGE plus. The user is able to fully customize pretty much every little bit of the app to make it better suit their habits, or soon-to-be habits!;1
Very awesome so far! I really love how customizable this is. It does so much it takes a while to learn how to utilize all the features, but I am super happy 👍. Hope it continues to be great with continued use.;1
Great App! I paid for the pro version. I like the customice options to create character traits and unique skills. Pls upload a yoga and a meditation icon :);1
An absolutely amazing app with even more amazing potential! I was looking for an app like this for a long time. No joke, enjoying my routines a lot more often ever since I started using this app. Thanks so much for this app!;1
Amazing system, some what hard to balance custom goals without someone else's help. But fun and helpfully none the less .;1
Let's me focus on working out and ect the rewards are good from me going to the scale I lost more than 50 pounds good for activities and exercise I hope you enjoy it as well because I have a reason to give it a five star rating I have set the reward to make me improve better and make it all a more of a challenge thank you creators for giving me this inspiration to do better and be more healthy I will continue using this app for the rest of my life - enjoyable of this app , mogginz;1
Best motivational game style to do list app I've tried. Subscription cost is very reasonable and the free version is great too. Definitely recommend!;1
I sent email to the developer (there's only one!) and they solved everything within minutes. Great app, helps with tasks and even small silly works. It is improving quickly and is getting better every time;1
Linking tasks to higher level skills & characteristics, and then seeing them increase, is perfect motivation for me.;1
Very nice. Takes effort to customize, but can be a useful tool.;1
This app is amazing I'm having fun just setting up that being said an optional progress bar for tasks would be really helpful;1
This is a very unique app, and has amazing potential. The concept of treating life like a video game is very powerful. If a person takes this real life game seriously, it can transform their life. This is the future of video gaming! Real life gaming!;1
This is my first time with a RPG but I love this To Do List.;1
Good concept. Would go for premium if price adjusted to be a bit more reasonable (to give context, other productivity apps created with a similar aim are around the $2-10 mark.);1
Great app. Makes doing hard and annoying tasks more fun.;1
Great App to help you achieve tasks and goals, also lets you customize your experience and be your own real life RPG hero. A Few bugs but still worth it!;1
Wonderful app! It keeps me motivated, knowing that after checking off a task, I'm closer to earning a reward.;1
Absolutely love this idea!! Made life fun ,only grip is that could be more user friendly when it comes to setting up habits and other misc functions;1
Cute way of keeping track of habits and staying motivated!! Really works. Let's you have as many hbaits as you want, very customizable.;1
Very versatile and customizable! Still new to it, but it looks very promising, if not polished yet.;1
It really helps alot, to encourage you to do the job, or habit, and keeps organized track of things, well worth the cost;1
Brilliant and incredible app. It turns my daily life into enjoyable one with simple RPG concept. Love it!!!;1
This app is the only thing keeping me organized during online classes 😅 I'm using the free version and it offers a lot more features than free versions of other to-do list apps;1
Love it, incredibly useful and I feel like a superhero growing in a gamification style system that tracks my lifestyle and productivity... Great product;1
This app is really great. Easy to keep track of all my many activities.;1
Really fun and thorough ^^;1
I loved the idea and downloaded to try it. This app is helping me a lot, thank you. BTW, I suggest you to do an IOS version, I have friends who want to use it too. Edit : I'm sure it'll be a huge success there too!;1
This app is actually really handy. It really keeps me motivated. I would highly reccomend this app to anyone that has trouble staying organized.;1
Just getting started with this app but so far I love it! Great way to track good habits and bad!;1
I've been doing this for several days and it's been working wonders;1
Everything is able to be modified. You can gamify whatever you want of your day a day life. It would be nice to sort tasks as you wish, just moving them in the order you want without needing to rename them or other tricks to put them in the order you like. However still being quite good for everything it offers;1
Hi, I just started using this app a few days ago and I'm absolutely blown away. It's kept me on track for a bunch of my activities and the UI is so customisable while being clean. I have a minor suggestion about if progress bars to recurrent activities can be added? Eg. I'm reading a book and have that as a recurring task but I'd like a slide bar to be able to advance my progress daily. Subtasks don't show in the widget as well. This app is still amazing and great work on everything so far!;1
The best app you can find of this kind. It is well built, creative and regularly updated. With this app you don't need any other planning or to-do list apps. It is completely worth buying. I gladly payed full price for this high quality app.;1
Probably the best task managing app out there.;1
This is the best, most customizable, app around. I appreciate the dev for being on top of responding to feedback and such. The app has grown over the years, and it keeps getting better and better with quality of life changes. It's actually spoiled me from installing other similar style apps again simply because I can just make everything to my taste all in one app. It really makes keeping a schedule feel like less of a chore, and for a gamer like me, that's golden. Real life questing is fun!;1
Awesome app overall. It would be great to see some kind of progress functionality inside tasks. For example counter 0-10(or any other number you input) for push-ups / book pages / words learned etc.;1
It's not that bad.;1
This app is brilliant! Clean, simple, and ultimately customizable. I've been wanting something like this for a while!;1
Awesome app The best i've ever used;1
Fun. Versatile!;1
Such a good idea. Very generous to help us out for free. Helps me recognize my accomplishments instead of dismissing them and losing track of how much progress I'm making. Would recommend having essential daily tasks pre-scheduled so that they're easy to tick off the list but writing in unique events only AFTER they've been accomplished in order to maintain intrinsic motivation, memory, and your capacity to self-monitor. Use this to record progress, not replace internal self-determination.;1
Super;1
Only complaint is how often it asks you to rate it. Other than that, the app is even so great IMO that it's work buying the subscription. I love how customizable it is. For sure one of my top 5 favorite apps.;1
I'm having lots of fun. I feel motivated to do more in the day. So far I have had no adds and the free version has everything you could need. I just hope it will work for me long term!;1
It's pretty cool app, very convenient to customer everything. And really immerse into the game which is your life;1
Very good app for complete tracking;1
Great App. Changing my Life;1
Really cute but I'm more into minimalist designs. It works really well tho if the interface seems like ur thing. I like that they have a reward system. I might just get it back just for that bc no other app that I've seen has that.;1
Life is like a video game. The free version: very detailed organization with a clean look, but well worth the time it takes to figure out.;1
Great app. I am trying to find an application like this one for a while. If you are looking for an app that will help you grow, this is the one for you. You have multiple skills to choose from. Also, you can create your own. I love that they had programming, and an Icon of Python to choose. To get the full features you need to purchase the application. However, you don't need to buy or watch annoying adds to use the application;1
Best habbit app;1
Really fun and thorough ^^;1
I need more options of anything;1
BEST TASK APP EVER!!!!;1
Great app, let's you customize pretty much anything you want to create your own system. Only reward app I kept coming back to. Has helped me to create change in my life.;1
i need the application thanks developers :);1
Very fun app. Lots of customization and a very polished app. Some features are blocked unless you pay(calender and some icons). They aren't needed to enjoy the app though. Can't complain, it works great reminding and motivating me to get stuff done. :);1
Awesome;1
Exceptional.;1
This app is amazing I'm having fun just setting up that being said an optional progress bar for tasks would be really helpful;1
Excellent app.;1
Perfect!!!;1
Great app. Makes doing hard and annoying tasks more fun.;1
I LOVE this app. I had tried Habit RPG and I liked the generalized idea behind it but wished it was more in depth & video game like, that you could not only lvl up but gain skill points, this is extremely detailed, even has characteristics you can lvl up as well as skills & allows for complete customization in everything. Being a nerd & someone who lacks discipline, I forsee this to be an extremely useful tool to help me stay on task, achieve my goals and feel like I am ACTUALLY lvling up IRL!!!;1
It really feels like I have a tabletop character sheet for myself, and I didn't even know I wanted it until now. The skill and stat customization is incredibly deep. The reward system is great. I highly recommend the premium, if you can afford it. These devs deserve it, and the calendar is a nice bonus on top of all the aesthetic additions.;1
This is cool, I'm on my first day and just put in all my major daily goals like exercising and reading. You can customize the traits that are rewarded by each activity, as well as penalties for failure. You can even link customizable titles to your level progression (my personal goal: Archwizard of the Order of Ptolemy). Very few features are locked behind the paywall, and everything that is essential is free.;1
awesome;1
very good;1
Excellent way to gamify your personal habits, with many levels of customization so you can set the difficulty levels of tasks as well as the level of self improvement those tasks provide.;1
It's a great app;1
Thanks for this perfect app. How I can use coins? How I can buy with coins??;1
Great idea. Managing yourself like playing game.;1
Fun way to track tasks;1
Nice app very use full;1
Linking tasks to higher level skills & characteristics, and then seeing them increase, is perfect motivation for me.;1
Amazing.;1
It's a really great app I love most that it reminds you about your tasks since I tend to forget a lot especially feeding my pets and watering my plants it's easy and fun to use especially with the reward system I think it would be challenging if the app had personal rewards for say keeping up with your tasks for a large period of time and all but honestly I love the app it's perfect you can personalize it to whatever you want or need;1

I really love this app It's fantastic in many ways. I wish I could adjust the overdue settings as tasks are set as overdue too quickly for me :);1
Amazing;1
Does everything I want it to do and more!;1
Amazing app!! You can literally modify EVERYTHING into the way you prefer! It's a little complex but with only minutes you can understand it's interface and fall in love with it. I love it even more because you can go up levels and it makes really more fun doing your tasks! No ads and almost everything for free. Pretty amazing!;1
I love this app. It has so many features and I love the creator listens to the app's reviews. That's rare, and when it happens, I have to give props to the creator. If there is a feature I would like, it's items that can change your current photo (temporarily). This app is a 10 🌟 app and I highly recommend it;1
I've only had this app for a couple of days but it's already helped me so much! I've tried a LOT of planner-type apps but I never felt motivated to follow through with them. This app allows you to make schedules and tasks, and it has a reward system in place! I've had a hard time focusing with all this online school stuff, but my productivity has shot up due to this app :) definitely worth a try. Thank you devs!;1
Hmm... I like it;1
It has everything you truly need with a degree of complexity, besides it's versatile. Liberty to do many things. Thanks for the app. NO ADDS. Seriously. Congrats;1
Hello, can you please add in your godlike widget transparent theme? I really need in this 🙏;1
I like it! I waited purposely almost 3 weeks in order to give here a true opinion. This application is amazing because it has so many possibilities, like everything is open for you, you can set anything. This is why I recommend to whom wants to use it, to take the time to understand as it works. Read the user guide included in the app so you can set the application to your exact goal. So at the beginning it may not so clear, and maybe there are more friendly use apps, but this one in adjustable;1
This is my first time with a RPG but I love this To Do List.;1
Gufy;1
This app is great. I was using different methods to change myself and they all failed but this RPG style game which I can even customize has proved to be most efficient.I would like the app developer to add some more stuff like new acheivements at different levels and getting access to more functions as we level up.😊(it will make app more interesting instead of getting more and more boring every time);1
So far loving this app;1
I enjoy this app because I am a task oriented person and I can see how much I have completed and the XP gaming quality to it makes me feel like I m reaching for a goal with immediate gratification not just doing work;1
Very easy to personalise and use 5⭐;1
Very nice;1
Love the app, it's much fun, engaging, and helpful to stay focused on your goals and developing new habits. Much better than competing apps (Habitica comes to mind) even if they have better social integration. Of course one can always add new features and improve design elements, but if you are looking for a task manager look no further. This is the best on the market. Highly engaging and fun to interact with.;1
As a fan of rpg's, and a slacker who needs encouragement to do things besides play video games, I have to say this is the greatest app ever. It's so much fun.;1
I enjoy using this app, it makes habit tracking fun and entertaining..;1
This app is really great. Easy to keep track of all my many activities.;1
Best life rpg app that I could find. Support is very helpful and fast at responding. Everything other app I tried was all about them milking money. But not this one.;1
Great! It's been helping me a lot;1
Es buena para aser mis abitos y mis tareas tiene muchas occiones;1
One of the bests to-do apps.;1
Good apps;1
Fun way to celebrate your accomplishments!;1
I love it the app, but why is so expensive?? Perhaps more cheap, help us to buy it!;1
Life changing app. For someone who loves RPG game so much like me, making myself the avatar in real life helps much to change my own attitude to work and lifestyle. My only comment is to allow description for every hero statuses. And maybe in the future, the icon will look more appealing with colors. Also, for premium members let them be able to have several heroes at once. This will inspire people to work on different aspect of their life more closely. Thank you for makin such an amazing app.;1
Great app. Could suggest rewards that fit the task type, offer actual customer / icon customization, and allow linkage of tasks to overarching goals that have separate rewards attached. Other than that - best app like this I can find - a lot of great features.;1
Been using the app for a couple of weeks and have lost 4lbs already. Took a bit of setting up with the tasks and rewards but it is very customisable. Gamifying my life might be just the thing I need to get into better habits and lose some weight!;1
This is an amazing app. You're able to customize almost everything to what you want. There are some things I'd love to see added, though. Some way to have an item reward you with money would be nice, and being able to have a task directly award you with an item, too. Developer(s), if you see this you have done an amazing job, I'll be getting the in app subscription soon to support you.;1
Great app which has everything I need! It's not very easy at first, but the result it gives is worth the effort. I like that you can see your characteristics in a diagram and how customizable everything is. Thank you!;1
Best motivational game style to do list app I've tried. Subscription cost is very reasonable and the free version is great too. Definitely recommend!;1
Amazing app!;1
Let's me focus on working out and ect the rewards are good from me going to the scale I lost more than 50 pounds good for activities and exercise I hope you enjoy it as well because I have a reason to give it a five star rating I have set the reward to make me improve better and make it all a more of a challenge thank you creators for giving me this inspiration to do better and be more healthy I will continue using this app for the rest of my life - enjoyable of this app , mogginz;1
This app makes me so much more productive;1
Great app;1
It's a really great app. Although it would be better if you could use costom icons for tasks and rewards and it would be better if the app didn't blur low quality pictures (as I like to use pixelated pictures). I also love the fact that this app works offline. Thank you for the great work 👍;1
Estive procurando por um aplicativo como esse.;1
Very neat;1
This what is really useful to me. It is useful to manage my time it is the good app for time management I prefer download this app and and use;0
It's the worst app ever, doesn't give any reminder doesn't work ..... Just a waste of time!!!!! 👎👎👎👎;0
limits habits to like 6 or whatever unless you pay, useless;0
Not sure why but it doesnt seem to alert you or at least does intermittently after its first alert. For example I had a habit to check a website every day at 11:00 to check for updates, it worked the first time however I get no other updates thereafter. Not much ise if theres no consistency.;0
I have autism and downloaded this app to help mange my tasks and routine, but after trying to work it out for 10 to 20 minutes, I've decided it's not for me. I couldn't set a very simple habit of brushing my teeth twice a day, or a reminder to stretch twice a week on certain days of the week. Not as straight forward to use or set up as it seemed.;0
I got the premium version The main drawbacks of this app are: 1- I cannot customize the categories 2- If I do a task earlier, it still alarming on scheduled alarming time 3- removing done tasks is not available Just moved to the bottom;0

"You have to pay for the dark mode? Really? It doesn't mattee how helpful this app could be for my life if it damages my eyes a lot more just because I can't afford to go premium and buy the amazing ""dark mode"". At least those whole 2 seconds of interacting with the app were fun.";0
Alarms or notifications don't work unless you open the app, then it floods all the notifications for the tasks as i open the app. Defeats the purpose of the app. Tedious round-about way to delete a Habit compared to deleting a Task. Not sure how this app got a 4.6 rating.;0
Terrible can't control whether things repeat it not and a study task is automatically a habit? Stupidly paid for the premium upfront. Agree with others that idk where 4.6 came from.;0
"If you want to use dark mode, you'll have to but ""premium"". I understand the need to make money off your app, but thats just scummy.";0
only 7 free habits;0
This app is a scam it does not work at all nothing is real here from the first day I used it it refused to work at all;0
Couldn't edit any habit in this apps can't add pages, episodes, and liters bec they're not available in the edit menu.. The only way to edit a habit is to delete it.;0
It's says Error when copying data when I tried to export data. Can you please mail me the solution again Please;0

UI seems quite simple, not overly complex. Can only add x5x [edit - 7] habits before having to pay. Hardly enough to actually truly test drive the app before paying for premium. I struggle to see how the cost matchs what you get in return. [edit] for me the habits are far more important than tasks which I can track using native apps. I feel like to get the full experience of that app there should be no limitations for a period of time before committing to spending anything on the app.;0
i wish it worths its price in the future. currently it doesn't support much. i haven't used it for months. i bought premium in December, 2019, Since then, i'm waiting an update they promised to release, however it's not happening. // last update improves a bit, so i changed to 2 stars.;0
It's good but for some reason, it keeps switching around everything. And I can't seem to move them around, so I have to delete them and start again. A bit frustrating but has a great purpose.;0
Seems OK. It was not made obvious that you have to pay to get unlimited habits, so was a waste of my time.;0
Paywall for nice features. Overpriced for what it does. $5 for dark mode, get out of here.;0
I write only 7goals,because The program did not accept. I like this app🤔🤔;0
I'm very sorry I bought the full version so quickly. The only benefit I found so far, is the ability to add more than 7 habits. I couldn't find a report that would provide information about my success and pinpoint areas that I seem to regularly miss. I was drawn to the simple UI but will probably write this off as a waste of money and return to Daily Tasks.;0
Not worth it. Doesn't have multiple times a day, you can't change a habit after initial setup, the interface is painful, get something better.;0
Good App! ❗BUT❗ Not much you can do with premium which pulls back the power that this app has the potential to punch. Improments: A) Create a Habit from the widget screen (only create a task possible from current widget). B) Multimedia! - we are 2020 with so much technology. You guys need to incorporate 'create a task' using your camera. So we can assign upto say pictures to 1 task. This allows us to open the task, view the homework and then complete it. C) more icons.;0
Cant see all habbits report in one screen. When by mistake you delete a habbit never can see again any where your previous data;0
Pretty solid app, does what it seems, but one problem for me is that the alarms don't go off when they're supposed to. Instead of going off at the time I set, they all go off next time I open the app. They never go off until I open the app, so they're useless.;0
Great idea, but does not give notifications for me, which was really the thing I was looking for....;0
Cool idea but I never got any of the notifications which is kinda the whole point;0
You need to pay its not really free;0
Though I would love to see it make improvements;0
I don't get this app;0

Update killed it a few months ago. The notes were all wrongly ordered. Pointed out the issues to the developer 1.5 months ago but no fix till date. Giving up on this app.;0

I got this app to setup a schedule to work from home, and it's been good for that. I just set up a bunch of habits at the right time each day. The widget has been handy too to keep my schedule on my home screen. The app could do to look a bit more modern. But all of my reminders come exactly 3 minutes late? Every notification for a habit comes exactly 3 minutes late (i.e. reminder set to 2:00PM, notification arrives at 2:03PM, etc.). Developers?;1
Absolutely amazing to be able to track both daily habits as well as tasks in the same app. Only thing that would make this the best choice for this purpose is to have a web application to at least be able to add new habits or tasks and mark them as completed. Was previously using todoist for this purpose and just switched to HabitNow ❣️ Some other useful features: - Add a length to a task or habit - Be able to set a time so that tasks and daily habits can be sorted by time of day;1
Helpful, but needs a way to quickly customize the order of the goals. Currently the choices are alphabetical, by priority, etc, but I would prefer a click and drag option to have them show up in the widget in the specific other I would like. I had to go into each goal and add a specific time to each one too get them in the order I want, even though I don't want to do them at a specific time.;1
Straight forward. I like the widgets on this and makes it easy to check in on what you need to do for the day. The scheduling is also very helpful because you can have tasks that are intermittent or habits that are intermittent on a regular schedule. It's also nice to be able to have a goal as a number or just a yes or no did you do it or not. And the statistics are nice because you can look back and see how consistent you've been with something and that will remind you to buckle down.;1
"Hi, I would've given this app 5/5 if I hadn't already spent so much time exploring it. It's so cumbersome as it is to check what I have scheduled for a day in the future. I have to enter the calendar and click on the date on a ""month-view- interface. Please make it more intuitive, let me swipe in a direction to navigate to the past/future. Let me also edit tasks/habits from a day in the future.";1
Really a fabulous app. I have tried several of the habit tracking apps. This is by far one of my favourite as it combines daily habit tasks with some ad hoc tasks for day to day life. Only one feature I miss in this app is the ability to select the snooze time. Ex. Whether I want to snooze for 1 hour or 1 day etc. Atleast some standard options. Currently it gives only 1 option. Apart from that, it's the best app;1
Amazing app.. landed to this one after trying a few available.. looking to buy it with advanced features.. but one important suggestion the daily status graph, it should include no. of tasks planned and how many are completed.. as well, along with habits addressed... I will surely update it with additional star as it gets supported..;1
Good application! One of the best habit tracker applications available on play store. Should have more features.. like authentication by fingerprint scanner, cloud storage, easily accessible sticky notes daily. The Notes option in daily habit calendar can be improved, perhaps adding a separate tab to view daily added notes would be a great idea ! I would have definitely bought premium, if it had cloud auto storage, better functionality for keeping Notes and fingerprint authentication.;1
Good app! I just wish their was a way to add a morning routine with subtasks or sub habits. Also I wish you could order your habits/tasks however you want, drag and drop style.;1
Just using the free version. Has been a major help as a tool along with a habit building book I'm reading. I like!;1
Beautifully designed. Lacks the option to make tasks recurring, which would be very helpful.;1
Dashboard/ charts better be inclusive all habits. Not just per one habit. Also download to excel would be nice;1
Useful and very nice apps, I bought premium, 5 stars when can backup with gdrive😁;1
Does exactly what it says. Would be 5 stars if the Categories could be customised.;1
Its good i wish i had different lists and could personalize the sound my alarms made each tine they went off;1
Great app with an ugly widget. If the widget was cleaner I'd give 5 stars.;1
Have been using it for a week only and will most likely go premium! I love it. But a few needed suggestions. An option to make a task recurring. And also maybe on one same habit, have different times per day: weekday /weekend. And I can't seem to edit which days for habits after the initial setup. I also would like the completed button to be a little bit harder do. Maybe a swipe would be nicer.;1
I like this app as it is a simple way of tracking your habits. However, there are a couple of things I wish were improved. 1. If I have updated all of my habits for the day, the app should know that and stop the daily reminder to complete them. 2. I wish the analysis was a little better. Have some graphs visually showing progress. Also, how about showing how I am doing on my habits as a whole, not just the individuals? For example, if I have a day where I don't do any of my habits. Thx;1
I wish this app allowed me to adjust what habit I want in any order I want. It lets me organize my abc order or time but not the way I need it. Also wish the conpleted habit or task would disaapear after I complete each day. It either stays where it is or goes to bottom. Other than these I like it.;1
Enjoying this app in general, but notifications don't appear at the set time, and right now it just keeps popping up without prompting. But otherwise it's very good.;1
I looked at a lot of habit tracking apps and this one was the closest I've found to what I was looking for. Unless I missed how/where to do them, there are three things I wish I could do in the app. First, create custom categories/subcategories, especially under health. Second, edit start dates without having to delete and retype to correct. Three, have the ability to add notes.;1
"Love the app. Best of it's kind IMO. Not perfect but so close! This app has the potential to be used for so much more than just habits and tasks! If I may suggest: - having the "".00"" digits be optional and not by default when setting/entering goals. - having multiple reminder/notification throughout the day on one habit to enter data multiple times a day (ex: 200 push ups a day, with 4 reminders so I can do 4x50 or something instead of having 4 habits) or the ability to group habits.";1
Habitnow is the first todo list with a key feature I've been looking for: to-do items that are automatically created at certain times. As such it is the best such app I've ever used. The only problem is that the author made no provision for hiding completed items. They just hang around cluttering the list--the best it does is move them to the bottom. I find it very odd that anyone would want to stare at completed to-do items. Certainly that shouldn't be the default, but there it is.;1
What if one wants to add a habit wherein one wants to do that thing 4 times in a week and not on 4 specific days of the week. I guess while adding a habit, this app requires one to select 4 specific days. Just a suggestion. It would be really great if this flexibility can be allowed.;1
It is a great app. But still there is space for some improvement. The calendar for example: you have one to add more tasks, other to see each specific task and the days that you did the job, but note one to see the sum of all tasks. You should create a resume calendar, where I can see the percentage of jobs that I accomplished in each day.;1
Very good. Simple and easy to use. I would like to see more statistics, because for now I can only see the statistics for only one habit at a time, but not a overall statistics.;1
I find the app amazing. It is one of the best habit apps that I've used. The only thing I don't like is that I've bought the premium but I don't feel like it was worth it. The only thing that I really needed was to have more than 7 habits but, the rest is just decoration. It would be really nice, if there is an overall progress page to check how am I doing in every Habit, instead of going through every single one of them. Another thing that would do this app just perfect, would be the possibility of having a desktop app for the computer. Other than that, I recommend to download it. Keep doing it so!;1
Have only used the app a little while, not to bad for basic tasks. To bad you can't do lots of tasks unless you buy the premium version. It's an easy app to use;1
I have been using this premium version of app from past 6 months and its really great, but i still believe there are few feature still missing in it to make things easy. Like there should be dashboard which gives details of all habbits progress in bar percentage marked successful. Currently you have to go to each habbit and check the status. So a centralized section giving more details on the progress would be helpful like it is in Habbit tracker app. Also a dynamic habbit counter could be added;1
It's good, but calendar view just don't make sense with the obligation to select a day to see it's schedule (which is not what I'd be looking for when in calendar view, preferring much more to see in one look any day I haven't done something, or something like rate of habits successfully done);1
Hesitant to buy premium. I feel like currently the only reason to buy premium is to have more than 7 habits and to make it look pretty. I'm on a budget and if I'm spending $5 I certainly want more bang for my buck. I wish the developers offered more in premium to make it worth the price.;1
Nice but please give option to add different time intervals for habits. For example I want to develop habit of drinking water and want the reminder to come at multiple particular times a day. The app allows only one specific time for the reminder, so please add the mentioned feature.;1
Preaty nice but they could improuve the UI it took me some time to figure it out. And I know that to use the widgets on the home screen you need to pay for premium but it would be an improvement if it would instead take you to the app;1
I love it! Only problem I found is that you can't edit the start date once the habit is created which is a nuisance.;1
Decent app with good features allowing for good habbit tracking but I am unable to reschedule dates on the habits. I have to delete the habit then remake it with the revised dates which is a big hassle;1
Addition of day counter for negative habits will be great. Also any option for writing notes for failures in habits will be useful. And widget isn't working.;1
Great app, very usable and straightforward, but I wish the calendar view showed the days you had completed all of your goals for that day. Seeing your progress streak would be very encouraging!;1
The app is perfect for people trying to get more organized it's easy to use and I use it all the time for homework or workouts the only tiny problem is that it has some locked features that u have to pay for;1
The app is pretty good and I love the reminders. However, it's kinda difficult to edit already made habits, especially the number goals.;1
Like the app. Either I haven't found it or they don't have it in the free app but I would like to see a calendar with all the habits listed each day. Would be fun to see at the end of the month all that I did on one calendar.;1
I really love the setup of this app. I wish it had the ability to see weekly progress in a bullet journal style. That would make it perfect for me.;1
Really like this app, the layout, and ease of use. However, I did not see a way to go back and edit your scheduled days. Everything else you can edit,..time, date, category, but wanted to change my days and I had to delete the entry and start over to modify my scheduled days. Otherwise, I would've rated it 5☆s;1
Almost Perfect, an option to export Archived Habits (preferably to excel) would be Great..;1
this is actually a really good app. I just have a couple of suggestions that make things a little more helpful 1. to be able to rearrange the habits or tasks by the time we have it set so it will look like more of a daily schedule instead of just a list 2. a button that goes with when you want to do your habit or task have it be more specific just in case we want to break our task or habit up and do half earlier in the day and the other half like drinking water or studying.;1
"Hey, awesome app. It wasn't long until I purchased the unlocked version. However, some things could be improved. For example, you can't change units after the habit is created. And it would be nice to hide the "".0"" part after digits, since mostly it refers to ""minutes"" or ""iterations"" or ""cups"" and it looks kinda sloppy to see your goal described as ""Learn at least 30.0 minutes"" or ""Drink at least 2.0 cups"". If the number is whole, why not just hide that point zero - it'll look neater, I think.";1
Great however marking down one star as can't find a way to edit frequency of habit once you've saved it. Have to delete and recreate habit with new frequency.;1
This is a great app! The ability to track my habits and edit them as needed is really awesome. There are just 2 things I'd really like to see that would make this a 5-star review for me: 1) Full editing options (currently can't edit the frequency for my times per period items), and 2) A help/glossary feature. I'm not sure exactly what the link icon means, as it is 0 on items I've not done or done once, but 1 on items that I've done twice or three times.;1
Another important feature missing is the ability to tell if I have future tasks scheduled when looking at the calendar. Currently the calander view shows days in a circle. Please colorize the background of that circle if there are tasks scheduled on that day. This is essential in order to know what days i have future tasks scheduled on. On top of the calendar it says to pick a day to see if i have a scheduled task. That is not efficient as i would need to go click each day one by one.;1
I like using the app and my weekly progress. I would like to see a total of how many things I did each day and maybe a graph? I like positive reinforcement.;1
I love this app, it's the only one I've found which combines tasks and habits in a simple way. However, I do get frustrated that I can't seem to change the scheduling of a habit after I've set it up. E.g. If it's set for once a week and I want to make it twice I have to delete it and create a new one. Can you please fix this;1
Very nice looking app for tracking habits and tasks. Have already replaced my old task app for HabitNow. Glad you can purchase the premium version and not have to buy a subscription like many other apps are now doing. I've been unable to figure out how to make tasks repeat and modify the schedule of existing habits. If these capabilities don't exist, would love to see these as improvements.;1
Make sure your phone settings are allowing the app to make notifications.The app works great, and is super helpful. The only thing I would recommend is to be able to make custom categories. Right now you can do other, but can't specify. Would definitely recommend app. Update 2- I can't seem to find the setting that lets me see the notifications. I can get it to work but only once then it stops. Would you be able to help me out? After my first review you said you'd be able to if I needed it.;1
Thank you for responding and I'm looking forward to that update (customized categories). Another improvement I'd love to see are more options for a goal besides a daily one, such as save $100 per week, etc. I got the Premium and love the dark theme, this app is the best I've found for my needs. Thank you!;1
I haven't started using it officially but I'm giving a 4 star because the User Interface is on point... I'm starting my habits on monday... Hopefully the functionality part will be as user friendly as the UI. Thank you;1
This app is really functional and helpful. The widget is great. Caveat: you can only track seven habits without paying. It's one time five bucks and worth it though. Suggestion to the developer: make checked off habits go to the bottom of the list so we can see what we haven't done yet more easily.;1
So close to being the perfect app. 2 things needed before I switch to using it. #1. Add ability to edit and change habit status for previous days. sometimes i don't have time or forget to update my habits on the day of. #2. Ability to set first day of week for calendar (i prefer Monday);1
There seems to be a bug in notification & alarm.when I set a alarm or notification for a particular habit. The app seems to misbehave;1
Would have been a five star had something as simple as a color theme change not came with a price. Seriously?! I have to pay premium prices just to go into dark mode. If I was going to pay, I'm most certainly not paying now. That's just too petty a thing. However, great concept guys.;1
Only used for a day but it's the best app I've found for daily tasks / to do lists. Would love to see the following: 1. Completed tasks move to the bottom 2. Tasks be linked to a numerical value. 3. The ability to order each item manually, daily.;1
I subscribed for premium because I feel it's nice. Could you tell me where to check the status report? And how to re-organize the habits freely without any sorting order? Thanks Edit: Please add option for statistics tab separately and need to work on showing them correctly on average.;1
I really like this app so far. Its flexible ans very customizable. The only thing I would add is either more categories/the ability to add my own. Health and Home are very broad categories. So being able to have sub categories would be nice;1
Just installed this app, it is easy to use and is quite beautiful. I would love to have a vision board feature page that I can put pics and maybe a daily quote feature (spiritual?) before jumping to Premium, please.;1
Easy to use. Great for creating new routines and habits;1
Very useful! Reminders at specific times which stay on the screen really help me get stuff done. Would like to be able to create own catagories and choose colours and icons for these in the premium version Thank you!;1
great app. could be better if I could have the same habit with multiple notification times so i can do it several times a day without having to recreate the habit several times. thanks;1
Its a good app! I honestly dont mind that you need to have premium to get the themes. As long as there are no ads im fine! I just wish you could create a widget that you can see on your home screen. That would be so convenient!;1
"Very nice, but would you consider letting people create custom categories, and setting intervals such as ""every 2 days"" instead of number of times a week? With that, this app would be perfect.";1
This is a very good app... just if the shopping list could be shared in watsapp would be very nice.;1
Nice app. Quick question can I add new categories when adding my habits? I'm not see an option. Only the options that came with the app is available. Is it that everything else must go under other? Please advise;1
Great updates! Nice color, nice experience, pro version is better, wished more was free. Need quick add tasks (see Tick Tick), needs folders, and a pomo timer would be awesome.Thanks for adding sort and categories!;1
I like this app alot. It lets me track my habits and goals in an intuitive way. Only would ask a few minor things, like a line on the bar chart that shows the limit/goal & task alarms even when app not active.;1
Love it, it works! I would like to have had it transfer my habits to the new phone but the backup folder didn't work. So I had to do them all over again. overall love it though.;1
It's relatively helpful especially when checking habit progress. However, some notifications do not come on time but nevertheless, i recommend it.;1
I like this app but I dont understand why I cant set up tasks that repeat unless they're habits. Or edit the categories. A habit is something you want to always do, I want to plan reoccurring tasks that are temporary.;1
Great app, keeps me on track and efficient. Helps me stick to my New Year's goals. Just wish we could add more habits.;1
Alarm not working at all. I have checked all settings in my phone they all are on. Could you please assist me on same.;1
All to do lists should embrace habit monitoring. Also, I like it when a pending task persists on the list until it's done or removed.;1
"Love it, bought premium. BUT needs an option to schedule reoccurring tasks like ""take mom shopping first Sunday of every month at 11am.""";1
So far I like the app. Question - I see a spot where it says, notes for the month, but how do I input notes? I don't see the option to enter notes.;1
Would be great to customize the alarm. I want to test pavlov effect with supplements.;1
Best productivity app I've found, goal progress tracking, hierarchical task management and progress reports would make it even better;1
Wish you could set tasks to recur at regular times, but it's a good app overall;1
I like it. It's quite easy to use. Would it be possible to sync data between devices? That would be a lovely plus!;1
Easy to use and the alarm works great;1
Please add an option to update habit/task status from the notification bar when I receive notification on the set time. Overall good app.;1
I liked it I just have to many things I want to put in it and I can't afford to pay for premium.;1
Good app with notifications for reminding you and helping you track your progress;1
Great app! How can I change the alarm sound;1
Easy, simple, cheerful, effective;1
Easy and practical !;1
awesome app .. i like the daily work and habit tracking .. thanks guys;1
Pretty good app, matches description.;1
Wish I could add more habits;1
Set a color which depends on percentage for goals.;1
Good app. Wish there were more customization;1
Thank you;1
Enjoying this app in general, but notifications don't appear at the set time, and right now it just keeps popping up without prompting. But otherwise it's very good.;1
Nice app;1
Nice;1
Love to use;1
Beautifully designed. Lacks the option to make tasks recurring, which would be very helpful.;1
Absolutely amazing to be able to track both daily habits as well as tasks in the same app. Only thing that would make this the best choice for this purpose is to have a web application to at least be able to add new habits or tasks and mark them as completed. Was previously using todoist for this purpose and just switched to HabitNow ❣️ Some other useful features: - Add a length to a task or habit - Be able to set a time so that tasks and daily habits can be sorted by time of day;1
Just using the free version. Has been a major help as a tool along with a habit building book I'm reading. I like!;1
Easy to use;1
Ufff me ayuda demasiado xq soy de las personas q se olvidan las cosas y esta app es la unica q encontre q tenia alarma;1
Good app! I just wish their was a way to add a morning routine with subtasks or sub habits. Also I wish you could order your habits/tasks however you want, drag and drop style.;1
I got this app to setup a schedule to work from home, and it's been good for that. I just set up a bunch of habits at the right time each day. The widget has been handy too to keep my schedule on my home screen. The app could do to look a bit more modern. But all of my reminders come exactly 3 minutes late? Every notification for a habit comes exactly 3 minutes late (i.e. reminder set to 2:00PM, notification arrives at 2:03PM, etc.). Developers?;1
Its good i wish i had different lists and could personalize the sound my alarms made each tine they went off;1
Good application! One of the best habit tracker applications available on play store. Should have more features.. like authentication by fingerprint scanner, cloud storage, easily accessible sticky notes daily. The Notes option in daily habit calendar can be improved, perhaps adding a separate tab to view daily added notes would be a great idea ! I would have definitely bought premium, if it had cloud auto storage, better functionality for keeping Notes and fingerprint authentication.;1
Dashboard/ charts better be inclusive all habits. Not just per one habit. Also download to excel would be nice;1
Helpful, but needs a way to quickly customize the order of the goals. Currently the choices are alphabetical, by priority, etc, but I would prefer a click and drag option to have them show up in the widget in the specific other I would like. I had to go into each goal and add a specific time to each one too get them in the order I want, even though I don't want to do them at a specific time.;1
Amazing app.. landed to this one after trying a few available.. looking to buy it with advanced features.. but one important suggestion the daily status graph, it should include no. of tasks planned and how many are completed.. as well, along with habits addressed... I will surely update it with additional star as it gets supported..;1
Does exactly what it says. Would be 5 stars if the Categories could be customised.;1
Wish I could add more habits;1
Useful and very nice apps, I bought premium, 5 stars when can backup with gdrive😁;1
Really a fabulous app. I have tried several of the habit tracking apps. This is by far one of my favourite as it combines daily habit tasks with some ad hoc tasks for day to day life. Only one feature I miss in this app is the ability to select the snooze time. Ex. Whether I want to snooze for 1 hour or 1 day etc. Atleast some standard options. Currently it gives only 1 option. Apart from that, it's the best app;1
Straight forward. I like the widgets on this and makes it easy to check in on what you need to do for the day. The scheduling is also very helpful because you can have tasks that are intermittent or habits that are intermittent on a regular schedule. It's also nice to be able to have a goal as a number or just a yes or no did you do it or not. And the statistics are nice because you can look back and see how consistent you've been with something and that will remind you to buckle down.;1
"Hi, I would've given this app 5/5 if I hadn't already spent so much time exploring it. It's so cumbersome as it is to check what I have scheduled for a day in the future. I have to enter the calendar and click on the date on a ""month-view- interface. Please make it more intuitive, let me swipe in a direction to navigate to the past/future. Let me also edit tasks/habits from a day in the future.";1
I wish this app allowed me to adjust what habit I want in any order I want. It lets me organize my abc order or time but not the way I need it. Also wish the conpleted habit or task would disaapear after I complete each day. It either stays where it is or goes to bottom. Other than these I like it.;1
Great app with an ugly widget. If the widget was cleaner I'd give 5 stars.;1
Almost Perfect, an option to export Archived Habits (preferably to excel) would be Great..;1
Not bad if you want to install;1
Love this;1
Decent app with good features allowing for good habbit tracking but I am unable to reschedule dates on the habits. I have to delete the habit then remake it with the revised dates which is a big hassle;1
Very good. Simple and easy to use. I would like to see more statistics, because for now I can only see the statistics for only one habit at a time, but not a overall statistics.;1
Easy to use and the alarm works great;1
Addition of day counter for negative habits will be great. Also any option for writing notes for failures in habits will be useful. And widget isn't working.;1
What if one wants to add a habit wherein one wants to do that thing 4 times in a week and not on 4 specific days of the week. I guess while adding a habit, this app requires one to select 4 specific days. Just a suggestion. It would be really great if this flexibility can be allowed.;1
I love it! Only problem I found is that you can't edit the start date once the habit is created which is a nuisance.;1
Have only used the app a little while, not to bad for basic tasks. To bad you can't do lots of tasks unless you buy the premium version. It's an easy app to use;1
Good;1
I like this app as it is a simple way of tracking your habits. However, there are a couple of things I wish were improved. 1. If I have updated all of my habits for the day, the app should know that and stop the daily reminder to complete them. 2. I wish the analysis was a little better. Have some graphs visually showing progress. Also, how about showing how I am doing on my habits as a whole, not just the individuals? For example, if I have a day where I don't do any of my habits. Thx;1
Have been using it for a week only and will most likely go premium! I love it. But a few needed suggestions. An option to make a task recurring. And also maybe on one same habit, have different times per day: weekday /weekend. And I can't seem to edit which days for habits after the initial setup. I also would like the completed button to be a little bit harder do. Maybe a swipe would be nicer.;1
Please create desktop app;1
Good;1
I really love the setup of this app. I wish it had the ability to see weekly progress in a bullet journal style. That would make it perfect for me.;1
Easy and practical !;1
Nice App Very Good ic k Zariye se Hm apna Roz mara ka Kam time pe Kr skty hein, apni adaat pr qabu pa skty hain or Kam ko Yad se kr skty hain kisi ka Shikwa gilla b nai rehta... Bohat smjhdari se banaya gaya hai ye App Nice Application...;1
The app is pretty good and I love the reminders. However, it's kinda difficult to edit already made habits, especially the number goals.;1
Easy to use. Great for creating new routines and habits;1
Like the app. Either I haven't found it or they don't have it in the free app but I would like to see a calendar with all the habits listed each day. Would be fun to see at the end of the month all that I did on one calendar.;1
Pretty good app, matches description.;1
Nice app. Quick question can I add new categories when adding my habits? I'm not see an option. Only the options that came with the app is available. Is it that everything else must go under other? Please advise;1
The app is perfect for people trying to get more organized it's easy to use and I use it all the time for homework or workouts the only tiny problem is that it has some locked features that u have to pay for;1
This is a very good app... just if the shopping list could be shared in watsapp would be very nice.;1
Why there's no option to change schedule?;1
It's good, but calendar view just don't make sense with the obligation to select a day to see it's schedule (which is not what I'd be looking for when in calendar view, preferring much more to see in one look any day I haven't done something, or something like rate of habits successfully done);1
Preaty nice but they could improuve the UI it took me some time to figure it out. And I know that to use the widgets on the home screen you need to pay for premium but it would be an improvement if it would instead take you to the app;1
Hesitant to buy premium. I feel like currently the only reason to buy premium is to have more than 7 habits and to make it look pretty. I'm on a budget and if I'm spending $5 I certainly want more bang for my buck. I wish the developers offered more in premium to make it worth the price.;1
Works Great;1
There seems to be a bug in notification & alarm.when I set a alarm or notification for a particular habit. The app seems to misbehave;1
I find the app amazing. It is one of the best habit apps that I've used. The only thing I don't like is that I've bought the premium but I don't feel like it was worth it. The only thing that I really needed was to have more than 7 habits but, the rest is just decoration. It would be really nice, if there is an overall progress page to check how am I doing in every Habit, instead of going through every single one of them. Another thing that would do this app just perfect, would be the possibility of having a desktop app for the computer. Other than that, I recommend to download it. Keep doing it so!;1
Great app, very usable and straightforward, but I wish the calendar view showed the days you had completed all of your goals for that day. Seeing your progress streak would be very encouraging!;1
Wish you could set tasks to recur at regular times, but it's a good app overall;1
It is a great app. But still there is space for some improvement. The calendar for example: you have one to add more tasks, other to see each specific task and the days that you did the job, but note one to see the sum of all tasks. You should create a resume calendar, where I can see the percentage of jobs that I accomplished in each day.;1
Easy, simple, cheerful, effective;1
"Funciona bien, pero si le hacen falta cosas, tengo la versión premium, resulta que debería existir la opción de crear categorías (donde uno pueda seleccionar el ícono que más le convenga de la lista que ustedes dejen y poder asignarle el nombre de la categoría) por ejemplo: como sabemos, existe categoría denominada ""study"" pero no se puede configurar mas de ahí. Sería bueno poder crear categorías con el nombre de cada materia para tener un mejor control de lo que se HACE.";1
I like using the app and my weekly progress. I would like to see a total of how many things I did each day and maybe a graph? I like positive reinforcement.;1
Would be great to customize the alarm. I want to test pavlov effect with supplements.;1
Habitnow is the first todo list with a key feature I've been looking for: to-do items that are automatically created at certain times. As such it is the best such app I've ever used. The only problem is that the author made no provision for hiding completed items. They just hang around cluttering the list--the best it does is move them to the bottom. I find it very odd that anyone would want to stare at completed to-do items. Certainly that shouldn't be the default, but there it is.;1
Great at 1st;1
Alarm not working at all. I have checked all settings in my phone they all are on. Could you please assist me on same.;1
"Love the app. Best of it's kind IMO. Not perfect but so close! This app has the potential to be used for so much more than just habits and tasks! If I may suggest: - having the "".00"" digits be optional and not by default when setting/entering goals. - having multiple reminder/notification throughout the day on one habit to enter data multiple times a day (ex: 200 push ups a day, with 4 reminders so I can do 4x50 or something instead of having 4 habits) or the ability to group habits.";1
Great however marking down one star as can't find a way to edit frequency of habit once you've saved it. Have to delete and recreate habit with new frequency.;1
não tem a opçāo de sub tarefa;1
I have been using this premium version of app from past 6 months and its really great, but i still believe there are few feature still missing in it to make things easy. Like there should be dashboard which gives details of all habbits progress in bar percentage marked successful. Currently you have to go to each habbit and check the status. So a centralized section giving more details on the progress would be helpful like it is in Habbit tracker app. Also a dynamic habbit counter could be added;1
Nice but please give option to add different time intervals for habits. For example I want to develop habit of drinking water and want the reminder to come at multiple particular times a day. The app allows only one specific time for the reminder, so please add the mentioned feature.;1
I haven't started using it officially but I'm giving a 4 star because the User Interface is on point... I'm starting my habits on monday... Hopefully the functionality part will be as user friendly as the UI. Thank you;1
I looked at a lot of habit tracking apps and this one was the closest I've found to what I was looking for. Unless I missed how/where to do them, there are three things I wish I could do in the app. First, create custom categories/subcategories, especially under health. Second, edit start dates without having to delete and retype to correct. Three, have the ability to add notes.;1
So far I like the app. Question - I see a spot where it says, notes for the month, but how do I input notes? I don't see the option to enter notes.;1
"Hey, awesome app. It wasn't long until I purchased the unlocked version. However, some things could be improved. For example, you can't change units after the habit is created. And it would be nice to hide the "".0"" part after digits, since mostly it refers to ""minutes"" or ""iterations"" or ""cups"" and it looks kinda sloppy to see your goal described as ""Learn at least 30.0 minutes"" or ""Drink at least 2.0 cups"". If the number is whole, why not just hide that point zero - it'll look neater, I think.";1
Great app! How can I change the alarm sound;1

Best productivity app I've found, goal progress tracking, hierarchical task management and progress reports would make it even better;1
I liked it but once I got it I saw a had no need for it and I felt like I don't need it as much as others.;1
Simple and practical;1
This is a great app! The ability to track my habits and edit them as needed is really awesome. There are just 2 things I'd really like to see that would make this a 5-star review for me: 1) Full editing options (currently can't edit the frequency for my times per period items), and 2) A help/glossary feature. I'm not sure exactly what the link icon means, as it is 0 on items I've not done or done once, but 1 on items that I've done twice or three times.;1
it s great;1
I like this app but I dont understand why I cant set up tasks that repeat unless they're habits. Or edit the categories. A habit is something you want to always do, I want to plan reoccurring tasks that are temporary.;1
Would have been a five star had something as simple as a color theme change not came with a price. Seriously?! I have to pay premium prices just to go into dark mode. If I was going to pay, I'm most certainly not paying now. That's just too petty a thing. However, great concept guys.;1
Great app, keeps me on track and efficient. Helps me stick to my New Year's goals. Just wish we could add more habits.;1
All to do lists should embrace habit monitoring. Also, I like it when a pending task persists on the list until it's done or removed.;1
Set a color which depends on percentage for goals.;1
Very good.;1
Very nice looking app for tracking habits and tasks. Have already replaced my old task app for HabitNow. Glad you can purchase the premium version and not have to buy a subscription like many other apps are now doing. I've been unable to figure out how to make tasks repeat and modify the schedule of existing habits. If these capabilities don't exist, would love to see these as improvements.;1
good enough👍👍👍;1
"Love it, bought premium. BUT needs an option to schedule reoccurring tasks like ""take mom shopping first Sunday of every month at 11am.""";1
Super clean, customizable, easy to use scheduling app. You can make it super simple or go in depth with pie charts and bar graphs. I love it, and its helping me start new habits. I love recording things but always give up because it takes too much effort long term. But the scheduled notifications remind me to log daily before I forget! No complaints from me, I highly recommend giving it a try.;1
I love this app. It's like my own pocket-PA. I make notes on habits and when I go back to view, they're not in chronological order. They're ordering by the day of the month regardless of what the month is (DD/MM/YY) e.g. 03/07/2020 then 04/03/2020 then 05/06/2020. I'd change it to Y/M/D but can't see how to. I'll give 5 stars anyway because it is a great app despite this minor but annoying glitch. Is there any way to edit the habits, such as to change the days? I can't find a way to do that.;1
Cute and functional little organisation app. Used the free version for a couple of months, liked it, transitioned to Premium - it's a one-off payment for a lifetime subscription, thought it was worth it. Clean design, good system. Here's what I think would make the app even better: 1. Setting a duration for tasks, not just habits. 2. Being able to move untimed tasks up and down the list. 3. More task icons! These are just things I would like ideally - love the app regardless!;1
I've never rated something on Google Play so for this app to get me to give an amazing rating is saying something. This is my favorite routine planning app because it allows you to set habits and routines in an intuitive way. It allows you to view the progress you're making with habits. And it gives you the most functionality without having to pay anything. Other apps give little functionality before you have to pay.;1
This app is very simple and easy 👍. My favorite quality that the app is offering it's users is the one time buy premium that's only 5 bucks!(finally not a monthly one so I can actually buy it) anyway love the app and I like my high importance tasks that I have to finish today... The importance level... Anyway see ya 🙃;1
This app is exactly what I was looking for! You can have tasks repeat daily, weekly, monthly, every three days, every Tuesday and Thursday, etc. You can also add one-time tasks that will show up every day on your checklist until you complete it. This has made my daily life so much easier and keeps me from forgetting to do important things. My one suggestion to make the app better would be the ability to drag and drop tasks and habits into a specific order. Besides that, it is GREAT 👍;1
"The best app I've found for tracking habits and tasks. I've searched a long time before choosing this one. Used it for some days and bought the premium version. And I don't regret it. Some tips to improvement: 1. Take the "".0"" out 2. More categories for habits (or the possibility to create your own ones). Edit: Each day I enjoy more and more this app. It is helping me a lot!";1
Amazing app, the premium is well worth it!!! Love the new UI and the fact that the developers are very active and keep adding new features! I'm glad to be supporting such a great and useful app! Definitely reccomend even if you're not getting premium, but there is no reason not to! . Edit: spelling;1
The ability to put the widget on your home screen is a game changer. Before, I couldn't hold my streaks past a couple of weeks. I'm now at 2 months with a 90% success rate. Crazy what a constant reminder can do for you.;1
Just what I needed in a habit tracker. Simply amazing. Only request I have is can we have in-built timer for some habits? Like if I want a track a habit of daily reading a book for 30 minutes, I want to see if I am reading for 30 minutes or less. Thanks.;1
Love that I can create a habit once, click on everyday and it shows up everyday!! The best part is I have a habit that's has to be done every 15 days and this app allows me to pick how many days between I want this habit to occur!! Best app yet!!!;1
I love this app! It's everything I needed, I use it to manage everything including taking my medications. Paying for premium was totally worth it especially since it's only a one time fee.;1
Great app that really makes tracking what you should be doing good. It also makes premium a one time relatively low price and honestly, everything I thought I need to track habits and to do lists are in this app: measurable goaling, reminders, deadlines and personal statistics.;1
Good app but its not notifying me in my new phone LG but my old phone it does ring can someone tell me how to fix this problem ? The habitNow team helped me fix the problem it was the feature of battery optimizer on my phone thank you great app!;1
I have liked this app so far. A few suggestions / questions 1. Custom category option would be great. 2. When tracking by count, a simple + button or swipe left right to mark each done will be practical. 3. Link count to alarm and automatically move the count up in daily goal once alarm is seen.;1
This is an excellent app, it has helped organize my life really well. I only wish I could be able to edit tasks after saving them. Otherwise it comes highly recommended.;1
Best habit tracking apps. Clean, easy to use, options of goal tracking besides yes/no, and the ability to make notes. Wish that notes could be toggled by historicity. Can that be done please?;1
Found this app super easy, customizable and helpful in every terms. It's new version is just awesome. We can add multiple reminders n it reminds u every day until your task is completed. It's good for making new habits too. Loved this app.;1
Update: After last update HabitNow got even better Problem with habit frequency resolved I increased from 4 to 5***** Great job! Very versatile, keeps you on the track and highlights your strengths and weaknesses So impressed that I bought premium on very first day to have option of unlimited habits;1
Tried many habit tracking apps, this one keeps it simple while maintaining primary functionalities that is expected from a habit tracker. No need for other day planner apps.;1
"The app is great and has helped a lot even though I'm not using premium. But I think there should be a ""remind me of the habit next time I open the phone"" option, that would be very useful";1
A very productive app. The only bad thing was that the dark theme was not available for free. Rest everything was fine.;1
Premium version is awesome. Must use app to develop self discipline and to track your activities. Good stats window and satisfying UI.;1
"Great motivator! Check those puppies off and they jump to the bottom of the list, with a nice green checkmark to boot! Using recurring daily habits(with numeric ""countdown"") rocks! Love this app!";1
Great option but you must divide your habits in sub-habits to really achieve them. Thanks to developer team. Its a great app.;1
Exactly what I was looking for. This app really helps me keep track of my habits and it super user friendly. Love it!;1
I love the stats it keeps on my progress. It motivates me to get my numbers up a little more each day. Very happy with this app.;1
This is wonderful and it's only $5 (one time) to get the premium version.;1
Wow this is what i was exactly looking for. Bought premium on the first day. Add many more features in the coming updates;1
It is easy to follow and I love the reminders! It is super helpful for me!;1
It's a wonderful app , good for setting reminders but I want 'already made plan' feature . That will be nice. Otherwise it's a nice offline app;1
Trying to instill better habits in my life. This app has been such a big help, very methodogic and gives me daily reminders to log before I go to bed.;1
This app has been super helpful for developing and maintaining habits and remembering to complete tasks. Would definitely recommend!;1
Switched from Habit Bull to Habit Now because Habit Now allows me to plan my day with my habits and tasks in one screen plus alarms. Easy to use, nice graphs and stats, always works. Use it all day, every day.;1
Great app, very easy to use. Calendar view is amazing!;1
Very intuitive interface for simple habits. Handy reminders. Does just what I need.;1
A very good app ... It helps me to manage my online classes and daily routine together... 😄😄😄😄;1
I love the flexibility and customization of this app. It is also very reliable!;1
This app is amazing for managing time. By installing it, you'll never miss a task.;1
Amazing App, it changes my life completely, from now on I can utilize my time and measure that efficiency I do advise everyone to avail this one;1
Best habit app to date! Has every feature were other apps only have limited features. The only habit app you'll ever need.;1
Its a wonderfull app, helps in keeping a track of your habits and how consistent you are with it;1
Very useful, does exactly what it's supposed to. A good new feature would be a DONE button on the push notifications;1
Best Habit app. It not only make habits become rontine, it has a task option many do not have. No need for two apps.;1
Amazing up. I really love it! I have been using it for several months now. It has really helped me to develop very important habits;1
Awesome app!! The only feature I wanna see in the future is setting durations for task.;1
Loved it.. easy tracking.. detailed statistics.. Thank you for this ..;1
Helpful without being overbearing/annoying. Have enjoyed utilizing it the last couple weeks to remind me of tasks I need to get done.;1
Was looking for a habit tracker and this is perfect. Simple and effective!;1
Nice application it was really very useful I did my work on time I was so much free time so that's good news I love it I'llI give u guys 5 🌟 stars. I want another to do app it must have talking alarm and please reply me THANKS FOR THE VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY NICE APP bye;1
Very helpful for a forgetful brain like mine really helps me to keep appointments and get stuff done 👍😁 u did a great job on the app;1
I love having a fully customizable checklist widget.;1
I paid only a few bucks for premium, and now I have it for life. I love it!;1
It is a practical app and easy to use.;1
I like app very simple and comfortable to use I deleted but back to app could please also create web version of the app. gonna be cool.;1
Highly recommended , it's really working well;1
This is a really good application for our pending task or work;1
Love it , just need to increase habits option;1
extremely helpful and easy to use;1
It is a very fantastic app and it reminds me to do studies and do my homework...;1
I love this app because it's really useful for planning;1
It worked perfectly for me and benefits me with fantastic pleasures!!;1
It enurages me to hat want to do in order to develop good healthy habits.;1
This app is getting better everyday , love it;1
This app helps you to achieve new goals good app 👌;1
Chill and easy. Good for keeping track of my habits;1
Super duper amazing app .... Exactly what i wanted;1
Very easy to use 😄😃;1
As someone who has eternally struggled to build and maintain habits this has made it so easy for me. I've had the app about a week (upon writing this review) and already I'm remembering my habits without prompts. I absolutely intend to buy the full version when possible and I have already recommended the app to multiple friends of mine. Absolutely great app.;1
First of all, I have to say that I almost downloaded and tried most of the habit tracking applications on Google Play and finally decided to use this one, I was looking for the below features: 1- Ability to have habits as yes or now, or a number of repetitions 2- No restriction on the number of per repetitions day 3- Show statistics related to repetitions per day as well as over all numbers 4- Be able to backdate a habit to a date in the past And I found all those features in this app I was hoping for a dark mode and cloud back in the free version but it's fair enough to have dark made exclusively for premium. Honestly, I think if you add cloud backup to premium, I will be purchasing that.;1
Amaizing app to manage with habits;1
need to add a custom tag with custom name - icon - color, please add it. (for inspiration see the TimeTune app!). add a multiple times/day reminder (like to drink water). for a revolutionary update, it'll be good to add subhabits (parent habit: stay healthy - childs: drink water, exercise...) so every time we complete a task and it show us that 1/5 completed. i set an habit and after 3 days i found that it's not necessary to do it all days, there's no option to EDIT DAYS OF HABIT. add it & KUtGW;1
Everything you need. I feel like this app is perfectly designed for me. Free version is awesome with no ads. Also for this app, premium version is worth buying if you need to track more than 7 habits.;1
Great app, just what I was looking for! No unnecessary stuff, only what is needed. The only thing I would add is some kind of progress tree, where I could add major goals with sub-goals to it, in the same very simple way as the habits.;1
I love this app! I can have different routines so I use the free version and have a weekday and a weekend routine. Love it!!! Helps me when i am having memory loss from my auto-immune disease;1
This is so helpful! I always have a to do list and this app saves so much time and focus on what I need to do. It also records habits i want to keep, or want to try to have in my day to day life style.;1
Honestly great. Simple. Effective. 1 time purchase. The UI has a sort of dated look but it's very quick and easy to use. Most of my daily habits vary alot based on which day it is, my schedule varies so much I cant put them on a specifik time, and I almost always do them in the same order. Therefore there should be an option to change the order of the habits manually, yourself, without any variables. :);1
I really like this app. The only things I would request is a full month breakdown of each task/habit that was recorded/ accomplished and it's stats. Also if a goals option could be added in addition to task and habit;1
Everything I needed in one App.;1
I was looking to hold myself more accountable for things I need to do every day and at certain times. I wish it had weekly/monthly statistics for completed vs missed but it has helped me a lot.;1
The best app of its kind, hands down. The only thing I would improve is the reminder system: right now the app would send you a notification to complete a habit/task even after you've already done it, when in my opinion it should automatically turn off. It's a minor thing, but it tends to get a bit silly when you've completed a lot of tasks ahead of schedule. Other than that, it's perfect.;1
I got this app to track my medication and it's perfect! I can set up how I want to take each medicine (yes/no or quantity), see the start date and adherence in the summary view, and even track side effects and effectiveness each day then see them in a chronological list in the sunmary. And the best part is that it's not tied to some medical database! Added bonus: I can track real to-dos as well. Overall, love this app!;1
So far so good. I decided to buy it almost immediately. It is exactly what suit my needs. App is quite flexible despite not too much settings available. I only wish two things more in the future. One: to make tasks which are done to be crossed out or make them disappear, especially on the widget, because right now if you have many tasks there is quite chaos on the screen and it is difficult to recognize things, Second: just for fun... make possible to get some sound when you mark task done:);1
I'm trying to develop some healthy habits, and this app is very good at reminding me to do things. The only complaint I have is that you can't actually organize your tasks and habits. I try to organize them by time and they don't move. I have a habit for 12pm listed after one for 3am, which is preceded by 4pm. This is very frustrating when you want to look at things in order. That's why I'm docking 1⭐. I like the function of it and I like the widget. Update: 1⭐ restored- thank you for helping!;1
"This app simply changed my life!!! From day 1! Thank you so much!! And I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to form daily habits, but laziness or lack of discipline gets in the way... This app will sort you out and it's fun to tick everything off as ""complete"" as the day goes on :)";1
It's helping me be more productive and mindful of the things that i want to do but aren't normally consistent with :) this app is good, but you still have to put in the work if you want to follow your habits 😉;1
Love the app only had for 2 days 👍;1
I love this app so much it has really helped me get into a morning and night time routine. Before I found this app I was always late for school and felt really unhealthy in myself. But now I'm I'm always early for school and make sure I wake up every morning at the right time thank you to this app so much;1
HabitNow-Daily Routine, Habits and To Do List is an app where people who need to mantain their daily schedule with different days, can easy track their routines according to the specific day and time. People on specific diet, with specific routines, with specific exercises can manyain their schedules easily. But it will be best if you can add multi task option. Other than that if i want to change my schedule there should be an option to change it manually. But still best.;1
"I just love it, although have not start achiving anything and that is because I just downloaded it... But with the process and all,i have a positive thoughts of achiving my goals with HabithNow 😍... Have never comment on any app on play store before but this app got me 😂🤩.... I recommend for everyone both student and everybody... It is a lovely app and I bet it,u will love it... So download it no ☺️... Before u regret it 😄.... And one more thing,u don't need data to access it 🤭🤭";1
The best app in the market for improving your daily habits. I researched many Habit apps in Play store and finally concluded that this is the best one. I changed my self a lot by regulary monitoring my habits through HabitNow App. The user interface is superb and quite simple. Also it provides habit statistics up to date. You can also enter your habits according to the category like Health, nutrition etc..A must have App for everybody!!;1
Love the app. It hasn't crashed even once. It would be nice if something appeared once the last habit of today is completed (it's a small personal victory) - congratulations message or small fireworks on the screen or something. Probably not everybody's preference, but I guess it could be switched off in settings.;1
Amazing app to keep a track of all the habits you need to put on priority. It has helped me a lot and changing my behaviour and habits.;1
Love it! The app I have been looking for;1
Just what I've been searching for. I like the compact view of the routines and tasks, and the satisfying way to mark them completed or not. The sorting options are useful. It would be great if you could add automatic syncing to gdrive at some point.;1
Great habit tracking app. Very clean and simple interface. Fantastically elegant design. Other habit tracking apps are not as user friendly. I contacted the developers on a couple of concerns I had and they were already working on these features to be added in future updates.;1
I've been using this app for a week and so far it is great! It has really helped me hold myself accountable for habits that I want to break or start. Way better than I thought. I never end up liking self help apps. I also never write reviews. Give the one a chance.;1
Excellent if you use it properly. The only thing I would change is the notification and alarms settings. I want notifications to come through even when I'm not actively looking at the app. Right now, I'm not notified until I open the app and the pop-ups show up.;1
Clean design. Love that I can track habits by number or yes/no. Also great that you can have a habit repeat every 'x' number of days.;1
It doesn't have 'number of the day' feature like: pray 5 times/day, so I can't use it as I wanted! So sorry!;1
This app is very useful for students so try it....;1
I love the flexibility and customization of this app. It is also very reliable!;1
The ability to put the widget on your home screen is a game changer. Before, I couldn't hold my streaks past a couple of weeks. I'm now at 2 months with a 90% success rate. Crazy what a constant reminder can do for you.;1
It is so good app I like it so much;1
Seems pretty good so far.;1
A very good app ... It helps me to manage my online classes and daily routine together... 😄😄😄😄;1
Tried many habit tracking apps, this one keeps it simple while maintaining primary functionalities that is expected from a habit tracker. No need for other day planner apps.;1
Really cool app.;1
Super clean, customizable, easy to use scheduling app. You can make it super simple or go in depth with pie charts and bar graphs. I love it, and its helping me start new habits. I love recording things but always give up because it takes too much effort long term. But the scheduled notifications remind me to log daily before I forget! No complaints from me, I highly recommend giving it a try.;1
Amazing app....it's very helpful for me;1
It is great....;1
This is wonderful and it's only $5 (one time) to get the premium version.;1
I love having a fully customizable checklist widget.;1
Its a wonderfull app, helps in keeping a track of your habits and how consistent you are with it;1
A very productive app. The only bad thing was that the dark theme was not available for free. Rest everything was fine.;1
I love it for this aap;1
It is easy to follow and I love the reminders! It is super helpful for me!;1
Best habit tracking apps. Clean, easy to use, options of goal tracking besides yes/no, and the ability to make notes. Wish that notes could be toggled by historicity. Can that be done please?;1
Chill and easy. Good for keeping track of my habits;1
This app is very simple and easy 👍. My favorite quality that the app is offering it's users is the one time buy premium that's only 5 bucks!(finally not a monthly one so I can actually buy it) anyway love the app and I like my high importance tasks that I have to finish today... The importance level... Anyway see ya 🙃;1
extremely helpful and easy to use;1
I'm so happy with this app;1
It worked perfectly for me and benefits me with fantastic pleasures!!;1
I've never rated something on Google Play so for this app to get me to give an amazing rating is saying something. This is my favorite routine planning app because it allows you to set habits and routines in an intuitive way. It allows you to view the progress you're making with habits. And it gives you the most functionality without having to pay anything. Other apps give little functionality before you have to pay.;1
Love it! The app I have been looking for;1
Loved it.. easy tracking.. detailed statistics.. Thank you for this ..;1
Premium version is awesome. Must use app to develop self discipline and to track your activities. Good stats window and satisfying UI.;1
Cute and functional little organisation app. Used the free version for a couple of months, liked it, transitioned to Premium - it's a one-off payment for a lifetime subscription, thought it was worth it. Clean design, good system. Here's what I think would make the app even better: 1. Setting a duration for tasks, not just habits. 2. Being able to move untimed tasks up and down the list. 3. More task icons! These are just things I would like ideally - love the app regardless!;1
Love that I can create a habit once, click on everyday and it shows up everyday!! The best part is I have a habit that's has to be done every 15 days and this app allows me to pick how many days between I want this habit to occur!! Best app yet!!!;1
Super duper amazing app .... Exactly what i wanted;1
Exactly what I was looking for. This app really helps me keep track of my habits and it super user friendly. Love it!;1
So nice daily routine app;1
Very Good App..😊👍;1
Good app but its not notifying me in my new phone LG but my old phone it does ring can someone tell me how to fix this problem ? The habitNow team helped me fix the problem it was the feature of battery optimizer on my phone thank you great app!;1
Highly recommended , it's really working well;1
I love this app because it's really useful for planning;1
I love this app! It's everything I needed, I use it to manage everything including taking my medications. Paying for premium was totally worth it especially since it's only a one time fee.;1
Best Habit app. It not only make habits become rontine, it has a task option many do not have. No need for two apps.;1
Love it. The answer of my hope. Thank you HabitNow 🤍;1
It is a very fantastic app and it reminds me to do studies and do my homework...;1
I love this app. It's like my own pocket-PA. I make notes on habits and when I go back to view, they're not in chronological order. They're ordering by the day of the month regardless of what the month is (DD/MM/YY) e.g. 03/07/2020 then 04/03/2020 then 05/06/2020. I'd change it to Y/M/D but can't see how to. I'll give 5 stars anyway because it is a great app despite this minor but annoying glitch. Is there any way to edit the habits, such as to change the days? I can't find a way to do that.;1
Cool;1
Nice application it was really very useful I did my work on time I was so much free time so that's good news I love it I'llI give u guys 5 🌟 stars. I want another to do app it must have talking alarm and please reply me THANKS FOR THE VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY NICE APP bye;1
It is a practical app and easy to use.;1
Best habit app to date! Has every feature were other apps only have limited features. The only habit app you'll ever need.;1
This is an excellent app, it has helped organize my life really well. I only wish I could be able to edit tasks after saving them. Otherwise it comes highly recommended.;1
Perfect app, I like it;1
It works;1
Great option but you must divide your habits in sub-habits to really achieve them. Thanks to developer team. Its a great app.;1
Great app, very easy to use. Calendar view is amazing!;1
Very easy to use 😄😃;1
Everything I needed in one App.;1
Love it , just need to increase habits option;1
It is a really useful app;1
This app is exactly what I was looking for! You can have tasks repeat daily, weekly, monthly, every three days, every Tuesday and Thursday, etc. You can also add one-time tasks that will show up every day on your checklist until you complete it. This has made my daily life so much easier and keeps me from forgetting to do important things. My one suggestion to make the app better would be the ability to drag and drop tasks and habits into a specific order. Besides that, it is GREAT 👍;1
My life seems to be taking a roadless travelled, I love it.;1
Wow this is what i was exactly looking for. Bought premium on the first day. Add many more features in the coming updates;1
Simple to use;1
It's a wonderful app , good for setting reminders but I want 'already made plan' feature . That will be nice. Otherwise it's a nice offline app;1
Peter Pan first born creator of existence;1
Trying to instill better habits in my life. This app has been such a big help, very methodogic and gives me daily reminders to log before I go to bed.;1
Nice app for daily activities...;1
Very good😛👍;1
Love the app only had for 2 days 👍;1
Just what I needed in a habit tracker. Simply amazing. Only request I have is can we have in-built timer for some habits? Like if I want a track a habit of daily reading a book for 30 minutes, I want to see if I am reading for 30 minutes or less. Thanks.;1
It enurages me to hat want to do in order to develop good healthy habits.;1
Can you please update the app with custom categories ? It would make the app perfect. Edit:Fixed it.;1
Useful;1
I love it ❤️;1
Good;1
Amazing app, the premium is well worth it!!! Love the new UI and the fact that the developers are very active and keep adding new features! I'm glad to be supporting such a great and useful app! Definitely reccomend even if you're not getting premium, but there is no reason not to! . Edit: spelling;1
I love the stats it keeps on my progress. It motivates me to get my numbers up a little more each day. Very happy with this app.;1
Awesome app!! The only feature I wanna see in the future is setting durations for task.;1
Very useful, does exactly what it's supposed to. A good new feature would be a DONE button on the push notifications;1
Amazing up. I really love it! I have been using it for several months now. It has really helped me to develop very important habits;1
This app helps you to achieve new goals good app 👌;1
Great app for productivity 👍;1
This app so helpful to meet;1
Does the job.;1
Works very well;1
Amaizing app to manage with habits;1
Great app that really makes tracking what you should be doing good. It also makes premium a one time relatively low price and honestly, everything I thought I need to track habits and to do lists are in this app: measurable goaling, reminders, deadlines and personal statistics.;1
Update: After last update HabitNow got even better Problem with habit frequency resolved I increased from 4 to 5***** Great job! Very versatile, keeps you on the track and highlights your strengths and weaknesses So impressed that I bought premium on very first day to have option of unlimited habits;1
Found this app super easy, customizable and helpful in every terms. It's new version is just awesome. We can add multiple reminders n it reminds u every day until your task is completed. It's good for making new habits too. Loved this app.;1
Excellent;1
I paid only a few bucks for premium, and now I have it for life. I love it!;1
I have liked this app so far. A few suggestions / questions 1. Custom category option would be great. 2. When tracking by count, a simple + button or swipe left right to mark each done will be practical. 3. Link count to alarm and automatically move the count up in daily goal once alarm is seen.;1
Was looking for a habit tracker and this is perfect. Simple and effective!;1
Amazing App, it changes my life completely, from now on I can utilize my time and measure that efficiency I do advise everyone to avail this one;1
It does exactly what I need it to do!;1
Thank you for this update it was long waited for and worth it I'm sure. Keep up the great work!;1
Very helpful for a forgetful brain like mine really helps me to keep appointments and get stuff done 👍😁 u did a great job on the app;1
Awesome app to track your life.;1
Easy to track;1
I like app very simple and comfortable to use I deleted but back to app could please also create web version of the app. gonna be cool.;1
Exactly what I was looking for. Works for me.;1
This app is amazing for managing time. By installing it, you'll never miss a task.;1
"There's a simple app on playstore named ""To do list"" and it does what it says. Yours, my god.. It is so terrible. It can't even do a simple task. For eg: few tasks that i have set on repeat doesn't even show automatically in the ""My day"" tab. I mean why not.";0
"Seems alright so far but since there's not a single setting for notifications, easy 1 star. Some lists I'm part of, i don't want or need notifications every single time something is added. Add notification settings for a higher rating. Something that shouldn't even need to be asked for. Not fixed still, plus widget doesn't update with restart. Stays blank on ""my day"" can't open it";0
I always loved wunderlist. One thing that is not copied from wunderlist is the ability to comment on a task and a notification sent to the people it was assigned to. To do only has notes which doesnt work the same way. Until that feature is back, i cannot give it 5 stars. Otherwise, the app works great.;0
Almost perfect. If you could make option so tasks tabs can be little smaller, that is more compact, it would be perfect app. It would save screen space, and fit more tabs on screen.;0
Switched over from wunderlist. This app isn't as smooth to use and last night I put 2 things on my to do list with a reminder at 9:00am. At 10:00am I went into the app and that is when the reminders showed up in my notification bar. Previous reminders have also showed up with 2 hr delays, don't rely on this app solely for important reminders.;0
Wunderlist was so good, but this app doesn't sync shared lists. When hubby and I used Wunderlist, he would add something to the shopping list and I would see it immediately. Shared list functionality seems like a one-off on this poor excuse for an app. You share it once, and any changes you make don't update the other person's list. I soooo badly miss my Wunderlist. Oh why did you desert us, Wunderlist? I would have gladly paid for a quality list app.;0
Completely unreliable. I am a tech savy guy and I know my apps. But damn Microsoft's software is degrading. This app just skips certain reminders. I miss events and tasks. It's nice to have everything on my PC as well, but it's unreliable. This is probably the third Micrsoft app I am uninstalling.;0
Why on earth would you create an app that doesn't link with your calendar??? The To Do app is straightforward on Android app and desktop version. HOWEVER, there's no way to link it to Microsoft 365 Calendar! It's within the same suite of Microsoft 365 and yet, you can't schedule on either one to show up on the other. That's asinine! ! You would think this would be a primary feature, but the Product Manager must be sleep at the wheel. It's mystifying.;0
Voting 1 star because it's the only way for developers to actually see this bug report: The widget doesn't have the Ding! completion sound. Making it nearly worthless, please fix!;0
Agree with other reviewers - Wunderlist worked much better. Have issues with items not synching between devices, takes a long time to manually synch, uploading attachments to items doesn't seem to work without restarting the app, the Windows pc version is particularly poor. Appears Microsoft have mucked around with the code base and broken a really good app :(;0
Update: After years and tons of my feedback reports on playstore, MS Feedback and Twitter you still haven't solve the main problem this app has: background sync doesn't work... Are you kidding me? The app has an awesome design but without background reminder sync is simply USELESS (I've got a OnePlus 6 but everything except this app work perfectly, background sync for everything too, so the problem is this useless app) Another awesome and clear from bug work Microsoft, well done!;0
To Do list cant be shown on widget. Only the myday can be, which i dont want to use. There are better options. microsoft refuses to use common sense agsin with this app. Your to do item needs to be less than about 15 words in order to view it. while editing the item you can write 50 words or more, but after saving you cant view it completely because the scroll doesnt function well enough. 75% of the screen real estate (like most microsoft sw) is wasted.;0
This app is CONSTANTLY dropping added data. I use it to remember all of my 'to-dos' and it drops 1/2 of them. Stuff I have deleted reappears. The app is NEVER in synch with the co-user of my lists. Terrible. I miss Wunderlist. I am in the process of finding a different app to manually transfer all of my data to. That process will be much less frustrating than trying to use this one.;0
It helps me stay organized, I can color code things, share lists and it syncs lightning fast. Update: Well that was short lived. For the last month syncing has been slow and broken. I just spent 20 minutes prepping a list only to come back and find it all reverted to what it was, trying to sync and failing. Also push notifications are broken on Android and windows 10 now. Just great. The app is essentially useless now;0
MS To Do is practically USELESS! Restricting access solely to MS account holders severely limits any ability to coordinate tasks/punch lists with non MS users (ie. customers, collaborators, vendors). It is inconvenient and UNNECESSARY to require the creation of a MS account in order to use an app that was previously available universally (as Wunderlist). This restriction was intentionally added. Who's genius idea was this?;0
I have used this after being forced to migrate from Wunderlist. The Android app works fairly well, but is not a solution when most of your work gets done on a computer. The web app that you end up using together with the Android app is complete garbage. It freezes on sufficiently complex to-do lists under current Chrome and Firefox versions and the developers can't be bothered to fix it. There are other open issues in the forums that never get addressed. This ends up making using the Android app for some use cases (manually reordering recurring tasks) required, as the browser tab will often freeze if you do it on the browser.;0
Widget not working again.. please fix it. it has a bug, i use poco f1, in desktop widget, as soon as i restart my phone, your widget stop responding, just shows an empty list. When we remove it and add it back from widget list. It works for some days,but problem keeps on occuring times and again. Please fix it.;0
I read this as a replacement of Wunderlist. But I don't understand why the team ignored the comments and comments notifications. With out comments and notifications for the same, this app will not work with small teams and businesses. I am very dissatisfied by the way wunderlist got killed and there is no right replacement for it. Thank you;0
Forced to move here from Wunderlist. Most of the features work fine (but there are no improvements over Wunderlist). However, the widgets keep crashing everyday which makes the application unusable for me. If you depend on widgets in any way you should stay away. Really sad that they need to destroy a perfectly working app in order to replace it with this mess...;0
Was forced to use this app instead of Wunderlist, which worked great for our needs. Now our shared lists are showing the shared icon, but not functioning as shared lists. I have 2 emails. Microsoft account is on other email, so Microsoft has created me TWO accounts to add to the confusion. There is no merge accounts. So, as usual, big tech screwed up something a little guy had working great.;0
EDIT: Last update still did not fix it. The widget will not stay on the list I need it to and always changes to My Day. Please fix! Used to work fine. Now the widget (which is the only way I use the app) constantly sets itself to My Day (which I NEVER use) instead of the shopping list I want it to show. I fix it, and it eventually goes back to my day. I remove the widget and add it again, and the same thing happens. Wunderlist never did this!!! If no fix ASAP, I will find another app.;0
Worst app ever!!! During the import from Wonderlist it removed all of my data. Leave it to MS to screw up a great app.;0
This is the only Microsoft app with no support for proper status bar and navigation bar colouring, the devs working on this app are lazy af especially compared to the ones working on the outlook and onedrive app;0
Great app but keep getting locked out. Every time I go to log in it tells me there's a problem with my Microsoft account and to log in using the browser. When logged into the browser it tells me there's been a violation and to check my recent activity, however nothing in my activity;0
Everything about the latest update is as bad as it gets. The bad home screen widget look with extra padding everywhere, no way to add new tasks to the bottom, gives me ride throughout 5-6 pages of the app everytime I delete something fro home screen widget. 😠😠 will be moving to something else.;0
Repeat reminders don't show notifications once you've completed it. If you set a weekly reminder to take your trash down to the road, once you get the first notification and complete it, it doesn't notify you the next week. This app is broken, FIX IT!!!!!;0
I HAVE THREE THINGS.. That's it 3 everyday Can't find a way You would think Microsoft would have an easy way for a user to get that into everyday. Some trick or easy way .. Nope So I looked for support and what I found was frequently asked questions that's it.. which were not helpful at all...THEN at the bottom of this it asked whether it's considerate of my time and does IT TIME stamping as if that was important you people are SO off the MARK. I;0
"""your favorite features are all in To Do"" - blatant lie, To Do doesn't have email notifications like Wunderlist, for example. upd 18/05/20. and now reminders left (accidentally or intended) overnight are simply disappearing, in the morning you won't see any To Do reminders! I'm really disappointed!";0
Great until it deletes all your lists. One day opened the app and noticed it said there was a sync error. Attempted to contact support and they just kept suggesting to clear my cache which wasn't fixing anything. If a to-do list app can't reliably keep a simple list not sure it's worth using...;0
"Only one major problem yet. The reminders are very weak and not nearly as easy and workable as in the Microsoft launcher. The reminder should vibrate long and make a very audible sound. Can't even customize it much. In short, make it as it comes in the ""glance menu"" of Microsoft launcher (accessed when swiped right on the home screen)";0
It does not synch accurately with my outlook calender, I would want my calendar events on outlooks to appear as tasks in this app. Also, it is my wish that a created list could be repeated on days I choose to go to work, to help my check stuff I routinely do on work days;0
"This is garbage. No ""to do"" list, just takes you to your Microsoft account and makes you sign in endlessly. Sometimes it texts a code to your phone, sometimes it says it did but didn't. It never actually works as what it's supposed to, though.";0
Wunderlist was better. It at least let you move items in the order you prefer. You would think Changing the date would organize it in that manner but no. It stays in the order in which it was assigned which means you have to scroll a lot more than necessary;0
"You've had all this time since you started ""fresh"" when you couldn't make Wunderlist do what you want and you still have syncing issues. Write some goddamn integration tests. Syncing should be the most basic functionality that you focus on since without it the app is actually useless.";0
It is not syncing properly between my husband and I. In fact, it won't sync at all. It did in the beginning and now it just won't. Really miss wunderlist! It was simple, easy to use and it WORKED!;0
"Not happy with this app. Use it as a widget and use the list ""groceris"". The app is all the time switching to ""my day"" and I can't switch it back on the arrow next to ""my day"" so I have to find the app, open it and close it so my list appears, really annoying!";0
Bring back Wunderlist! I was using this to coordinate to-dos and such with my girlfriend after having used Wunderlist for months. The lists refuse to sync up properly. We constantly have two different lists going on. Very disappointing.;0
Syncing between phone and desktop apps aren't ideal. Also, is there an option to view recent activities. For example if someone accidentally deleted something but cant remember in which folder.;0
Need to access my tasks on my phone grouped same as Task Pane in Outlook Task Pane in desktop. Functioned acceptably prior to an update May 7th. Planned smart list previously included overdue items in current day's list, thus automatically rolling over incomplete tasks. Planned also included all tasks GROUPED by date. Microsoft responded 5/11 with intent to add combined view soon and if the All Smartlist was acceptable workaround. NO, it is no better than the Task or Planned Smartlist.;0
It sucks. My wife and I loved Wunderlist. We were synced with no problems. We have tried a million times to sync this bullshxt with no success.;0
Why do you have to make a microsoft account just to use a to-do list? After which it stays at a loading screen indefinitely. Yup, great app guys. Truly setting the bar high for these other apps...;0
The app keeps losing sync which breaks the shared lists that I have with my wife. The app that Microsoft took over and destroyed worked much better, typical of them. Time to find something better.;0
Hate it. My wife and I used Wunderlist for years. My wife can't even access Microsoft to do because she has an iphone. So what's the point. Went from a very helpful tool to useless. Back to physical notepads. Good job.;0
Doesn't sync with Microsoft Outlook To-Dos categories. Useless to me without this. I'll wait until they add this feature to use. I will keep using Tasks and Notes app until then. That app works great!;0
Recurring reminders feature is not available. Let's say I want to do a particular task every day and want to have a reminder daily. I tried for it using this app but it does not work.;0
Too confusing, too many categories. Going back to Wunderlist if I can. I liked Wunderlist better. There was more logic to it.;0
I like the app, but I have to give it one star now because the notifications stopped working after some recent update (Mi 9, MIUI 12) and the support doesn't answer my questions.;0
It's not Wunderlist. Took a good app and ruined it. Just opened it up (July 2020) no sync. Try later. Huh? Microsoft garbage?;0
For recurring reminder, the date need to be mentioned 2 times.. 1 for reminder and 1 for due date.. ridiculous. MS may purchase wunderlist, but can't retain their users.. they will migrate to other better apps.;0
Inferior to wunderlist in every way. Sync works poorly, planned smart list doesn't group by day which is very frustrating, search function is poor.;0
Problem with recurring tasks: 1. Goes offline, checked recurring task. Task goes missing after. 2. Goes back online, returns all missing recurring tasks INCOMPLETE.;0
Very unreliable. I have a daily recurring task, it is synced between phone and desktop, but the reminder doesn't fire on either platform.;0
Since you guys are from the Wunderlist team, Why not just copy the whole excellent Wunderlist function into the To-do app? The developer since never bother to respond to customer complaints.;0
I miss wonder list. To Do sucks. It is impossible to get anything entered without wanting to throwmy phone across the room. Dear Microsoft screw yourself.;0
The app keeps signing me out daily. I have to sign-in on a daily basis. I tried reinstalling the app. It still doesn't work. Please fix this;0
"Waited for the issue of #reminders to get resolved but they haven't fixed it yet. So switched to another app named ""Any.do"". Would suggest others to do the same.";0
Features are good but i strongly recommend you to not install this app. Waste of time. Without any reason they freezed my account two times in one night.;0
Made us delete Wonderlist which was far superior app, terrible switch over had to pretty much create lists again, now things seem to randomly disappear off the lists too;0
"Reminders for repeated tasks doesn't work. How hard is it to have a reminder option of ""xyz AM/PM on the repeated date"".";0
The app is not upto the mark 1. Notification window is not there 2. Chat window is not available on every task;0
It doesn't work when i am offline, it should work offline. Doesn't show reminder when data is turned off.;0
Used Wunderlist for family shopping etc. But now forced to use Todo which doesn't sync between my android phone and my daughter's iPhone. Any suggestions for alternatives? Does anyone at Microsoft even care? No response, nothing.;0
"Can't sync anymore, and all my lists are gone after I relogged (no lists when I log in through the browser either). Tried ""Get help"" but no reply for several days now.";0
You are not letting us synchronize with 3rd-party calendars. It is not easy to add others to tasks, either. Stupid Java and Python.;0
Getting pushed here from Wunderlist. It does not live up to it in the slightest.;0
My husband and I have shared shopping lists and this app is not updating correctly. Bring back Wunderlist!!;0
I HATE HATE HATE how the My Day feature works. Totally different than Wunderlist and completely breaks my (and many others') workflow. Uninstalled.;0
Trash design compare to wonderlist, Microsoft seriously such a design ? Do not want to use it will look for alternative options on market 0 stars;0
It stops functioning after I restart my phone, I tried whitelisting it, but it does not help.;0
This app doesn't remind to complete the tasks no matter what you do. I missed an important activity because of this app which caused me considerable financial loss. Please stick to Any.do!;0
Some reminders get missed and I don't know why, mostly those that must repeat.;0
Too bad app not working since the day i started using... The apps again and again saying some prob occurred please check 8n browser.....;0
In DND+vibrate, reminder sound doesn't work. 'To Do Reminder' app has sound for that case.;0
My account is not syncing for past week. I am not suren what is issue. Please check quickly and revert back.;0
Widget not working - this app is normally fantastic but lately my widgets are blank all the time. Very frustrating!;0
Forced to switch from Wunderlist. This is a piece of garbage by comparison. Uninstaller inbound.;0
App itself works reliably doesn't crash but service itself needs filtering and sorting on all views and ability to forward email to list;0
Last update killed app for me. It shows that I constantly offline, which I am not.;0
Dumps recently added items when forcing a sync. You don't realize until you are at the store with LAST WEEKS list.;0
You guys ruined the Wunderlist app. You changed it in a way that is less useful for me and how I used this app.;0
After recent update this app not working properly...(Recent Tasks & Reminder not working);0
Signing up is itself a big deal.. Such problematic.. Cant even put the code..;0
if it even had the semblance of function with wunderlist I would have understood....but it doesn't....;0
Was good on Windows mobile, then later became guglifyied and useless. Pass.;0
Timestamp not available on to do list. I will now search for another app that can do that;0
Another Microsoft app I am forced to sign in to use. Nothing like alienating your customers. I have come to the conclusion that you enjoy it.;0
I downloaded the app on my android phone and ipad pro and there is no sharing icon on either!! Please fix asap.;0
What mess. Can we add negative stars so I can properly rate this terrible app? Microsoft worked extra hard to make simple tasks so obscure.;0
An option for Daily jobs to carry over is necessary. Having to re-add tasks is such a waste of time.;0
Totally useless - sharing lists does not work.;0
App not useful yet! Cannot arrange list by Outlook Category.;0
Latest update is rubbish, widgets don't work - not productive because I cannot see my to-do list.;0
Wondeerful Wunderlist app closed down by the corporate US. Sad times.;0
Isn't half as good as Wunderlist. Find another app.;0
Arrrgghh Wunderlist was great, Microsoft To do is not!;0
"I'm using the app mainly as a shopping list for items I buy repeatedly. It worked fine until the recent update 05/05/20. Now the completed tasks are moved to the bottom, and it's no longer possible to sort those as you like (alphabetically in my case). When I want to buy e.g. milk, it's really difficult to find the item ""milk"" between hundreds of other completed, but unsorted items to uncheck it. Please, take the recent change back, or make it posssible to sort completed tasks separately.";0
The reminder feature and due date features don't work - so what is the point of using this app? They often fail to appear on my notification tray. Overdue tasks disappear from it. I can set reoccurring due dates for tasks, but why can't I set reoccurring reminders for this task. There is a lot of potential here, but this app is still too unpolished.;0
"The recent update has changed everything I liked about this app. In my ""task"" view I manually have to select overdue/today/tomorrow/this week in order to see the corresponding tasks. In the previous version I had the ability to see all of them and hide the tasks which weren't relevant. I should be able to see multiple lists at the same time, and this filter just doesn't let me. I want to see my ""overdue"" and ""today's"" planned task in one view. That's the most important for me.";0
Planned tab sucks. You think you have nothing to do only to realize that they hide overdue, today, tomorrow, etc in a drop-down. Before I could see what needed to be done on a single screen. Now I need to click 4 times to see what is due when. Completely useless! This app has been ruined and no longer suits my needs;0
After the mandatory change from Wunderlost the app worked wothout issue until today. The app signed out of the MS account for some reason and it just kept crashing endlessly and prevented the use of my phone. Why? I also had to sign in multiple times to be able to get it right. Why change it fron Wunderlist to do a worse job? Why break something that was working?;0
It's OK as a basic to do list if you're not interested in prioritising your tasks for the day. You can set a due date but no time. And you can sort by due date. But there's no way of them sorting them into the order you want to do them in the day. You can set a time on the reminder only. I'll stick to using Ayoa, where I can easily drag each item on my list into the order I want. And much more besides.;0
"There's a simple app on playstore named ""To do list"" and it does what it says. Yours, my god.. It is so terrible. It can't even do a simple task. For eg: few tasks that i have set on repeat doesn't even show automatically in the ""My day"" tab. I mean why not.";0
This is the only Microsoft app with no support for proper status bar and navigation bar colouring, the devs working on this app are lazy af especially compared to the ones working on the outlook and onedrive app;0
Many problems with this app..;0
Need an undo button!;0
i can't use it for a month because email was wrong. that's insane;0
I dont understand the idea of an account. Just give me an offline program;0
Reminders DON'T work.;0
Worst app ever!!! During the import from Wonderlist it removed all of my data. Leave it to MS to screw up a great app.;0
It doesn't run on oneplus 7t Pro;0
"Seems alright so far but since there's not a single setting for notifications, easy 1 star. Some lists I'm part of, i don't want or need notifications every single time something is added. Add notification settings for a higher rating. Something that shouldn't even need to be asked for. Not fixed still, plus widget doesn't update with restart. Stays blank on ""my day"" can't open it";0
Voting 1 star because it's the only way for developers to actually see this bug report: The widget doesn't have the Ding! completion sound. Making it nearly worthless, please fix!;0
Almost perfect. If you could make option so tasks tabs can be little smaller, that is more compact, it would be perfect app. It would save screen space, and fit more tabs on screen.;0
I miss wonder list. To Do sucks. It is impossible to get anything entered without wanting to throwmy phone across the room. Dear Microsoft screw yourself.;0
Completely unreliable. I am a tech savy guy and I know my apps. But damn Microsoft's software is degrading. This app just skips certain reminders. I miss events and tasks. It's nice to have everything on my PC as well, but it's unreliable. This is probably the third Micrsoft app I am uninstalling.;0
I dont wanna log in with stupid micro acc;0
Agree with other reviewers - Wunderlist worked much better. Have issues with items not synching between devices, takes a long time to manually synch, uploading attachments to items doesn't seem to work without restarting the app, the Windows pc version is particularly poor. Appears Microsoft have mucked around with the code base and broken a really good app :(;0
It's not Wunderlist. Took a good app and ruined it. Just opened it up (July 2020) no sync. Try later. Huh? Microsoft garbage?;0
Need be online every time start;0
Switched over from wunderlist. This app isn't as smooth to use and last night I put 2 things on my to do list with a reminder at 9:00am. At 10:00am I went into the app and that is when the reminders showed up in my notification bar. Previous reminders have also showed up with 2 hr delays, don't rely on this app solely for important reminders.;0
MS To Do is practically USELESS! Restricting access solely to MS account holders severely limits any ability to coordinate tasks/punch lists with non MS users (ie. customers, collaborators, vendors). It is inconvenient and UNNECESSARY to require the creation of a MS account in order to use an app that was previously available universally (as Wunderlist). This restriction was intentionally added. Who's genius idea was this?;0
Terrible;0
Inferior to wunderlist in every way. Sync works poorly, planned smart list doesn't group by day which is very frustrating, search function is poor.;0
Too bad app not working since the day i started using... The apps again and again saying some prob occurred please check 8n browser.....;0
Not good;0
Sign in not working;0
requires microsoft account. deal breaker.;0
Very unreliable. I have a daily recurring task, it is synced between phone and desktop, but the reminder doesn't fire on either platform.;0
Update: After years and tons of my feedback reports on playstore, MS Feedback and Twitter you still haven't solve the main problem this app has: background sync doesn't work... Are you kidding me? The app has an awesome design but without background reminder sync is simply USELESS (I've got a OnePlus 6 but everything except this app work perfectly, background sync for everything too, so the problem is this useless app) Another awesome and clear from bug work Microsoft, well done!;0
Totally useless - sharing lists does not work.;0
Some reminders get missed and I don't know why, mostly those that must repeat.;0
I like the app, but I have to give it one star now because the notifications stopped working after some recent update (Mi 9, MIUI 12) and the support doesn't answer my questions.;0
Why on earth would you create an app that doesn't link with your calendar??? The To Do app is straightforward on Android app and desktop version. HOWEVER, there's no way to link it to Microsoft 365 Calendar! It's within the same suite of Microsoft 365 and yet, you can't schedule on either one to show up on the other. That's asinine! ! You would think this would be a primary feature, but the Product Manager must be sleep at the wheel. It's mystifying.;0
Complicated steps to sign in;0
Worst app ever. Showing no notufication for reminder. Pathetic. Useless.;0
I always loved wunderlist. One thing that is not copied from wunderlist is the ability to comment on a task and a notification sent to the people it was assigned to. To do only has notes which doesnt work the same way. Until that feature is back, i cannot give it 5 stars. Otherwise, the app works great.;0
Widget not working again.. please fix it. it has a bug, i use poco f1, in desktop widget, as soon as i restart my phone, your widget stop responding, just shows an empty list. When we remove it and add it back from widget list. It works for some days,but problem keeps on occuring times and again. Please fix it.;0
Forcing to create MSFT account..;0
I HAVE THREE THINGS.. That's it 3 everyday Can't find a way You would think Microsoft would have an easy way for a user to get that into everyday. Some trick or easy way .. Nope So I looked for support and what I found was frequently asked questions that's it.. which were not helpful at all...THEN at the bottom of this it asked whether it's considerate of my time and does IT TIME stamping as if that was important you people are SO off the MARK. I;0
Not sure.;0
Syncing between phone and desktop apps aren't ideal. Also, is there an option to view recent activities. For example if someone accidentally deleted something but cant remember in which folder.;0
To Do list cant be shown on widget. Only the myday can be, which i dont want to use. There are better options. microsoft refuses to use common sense agsin with this app. Your to do item needs to be less than about 15 words in order to view it. while editing the item you can write 50 words or more, but after saving you cant view it completely because the scroll doesnt function well enough. 75% of the screen real estate (like most microsoft sw) is wasted.;0
Uninstalled due to frequent restart or login attempts;0
It does not synch accurately with my outlook calender, I would want my calendar events on outlooks to appear as tasks in this app. Also, it is my wish that a created list could be repeated on days I choose to go to work, to help my check stuff I routinely do on work days;0
Very bad experience with this app. This app works for only those user who are already subscriber to other apps or software of Microsoft. Password blocked and didn't let the password reset in the name of security;0
Can't use this without creating an account? No thanks.;0
It sucks. My wife and I loved Wunderlist. We were synced with no problems. We have tried a million times to sync this bullshxt with no success.;0
Rubbish;0
Too confusing, too many categories. Going back to Wunderlist if I can. I liked Wunderlist better. There was more logic to it.;0
Wunderlist was so good, but this app doesn't sync shared lists. When hubby and I used Wunderlist, he would add something to the shopping list and I would see it immediately. Shared list functionality seems like a one-off on this poor excuse for an app. You share it once, and any changes you make don't update the other person's list. I soooo badly miss my Wunderlist. Oh why did you desert us, Wunderlist? I would have gladly paid for a quality list app.;0
The app is not upto the mark 1. Notification window is not there 2. Chat window is not available on every task;0
if it even had the semblance of function with wunderlist I would have understood....but it doesn't....;0
No Synch to Google Calendar;0
Bad;0
After recent update this app not working properly...(Recent Tasks & Reminder not working);0
Wunderlist are class traitors and sell outs.;0
Couldn't even log in and no error messages received at all;0
Useless App. It logs me out after few hours and no matter what I try, I cannot log in again.;0
Wunderlist was better. It at least let you move items in the order you prefer. You would think Changing the date would organize it in that manner but no. It stays in the order in which it was assigned which means you have to scroll a lot more than necessary;0
Doesnt use categories from outlook;0
rubbish. forces you to have a Microsoft email which is stupid.;0
worste app ever;0
Why do you have to register is it necessary;0
Why did you have to ruin a good thing Microsoft. Wunderlist was perfect until you came along. The primary reason why I enjoyed Wunderlist was for it's flawless widget. When you checked off a task from the widget it would simply disappear. But you guys can't seem to do the same thing. Worse part is that your widget glitches out after completing a task (it's more like a 'twitch') like it's trying to get rid of it but can't. Didn't you guys buy the program? Why did you have to change it?;0
First forced me to sign in. Then took me to a Microsoft menu page instead of the list. Then kept me waiting for the to do list to load. No thanks. Even the clunky default notes app works better.;0
Bring back Wunderlist! I was using this to coordinate to-dos and such with my girlfriend after having used Wunderlist for months. The lists refuse to sync up properly. We constantly have two different lists going on. Very disappointing.;0
You are not letting us synchronize with 3rd-party calendars. It is not easy to add others to tasks, either. Stupid Java and Python.;0
Wunderlist was better!;0
This App sucks compared to Wunderlist.;0
Widget not working - this app is normally fantastic but lately my widgets are blank all the time. Very frustrating!;0
Minhas tarefas ficam sumindo, os horários e alertas não são renovados, péssimo, não recomendo.;0
This app doesn't remind to complete the tasks no matter what you do. I missed an important activity because of this app which caused me considerable financial loss. Please stick to Any.do!;0
The app wouldn't intall.;0
Since you guys are from the Wunderlist team, Why not just copy the whole excellent Wunderlist function into the To-do app? The developer since never bother to respond to customer complaints.;0
Same functionalities be restored as Wunderlist. Not able to acess for completed or deleted tasks;0
"Can't sync anymore, and all my lists are gone after I relogged (no lists when I log in through the browser either). Tried ""Get help"" but no reply for several days now.";0
You have to create an account to use;0
The application should ask for all required permissions for populating the task reminder. Currently I was struggling for getting an auto population of task reminder. So uninstalling same.;0
I downloaded the app on my android phone and ipad pro and there is no sharing icon on either!! Please fix asap.;0
Timestamp not available on to do list. I will now search for another app that can do that;0
"You've had all this time since you started ""fresh"" when you couldn't make Wunderlist do what you want and you still have syncing issues. Write some goddamn integration tests. Syncing should be the most basic functionality that you focus on since without it the app is actually useless.";0
Sorry i'm uninstall;0
Not being able to add anyone to a to do list is just wrong.;0
Boring app. Pls don't install it. Instead make your own personilized to do list on a sheet of paper.;0
Can't understand how it works;0
Didn't use it;0
Arabic language where???????;0
I HATE HATE HATE how the My Day feature works. Totally different than Wunderlist and completely breaks my (and many others') workflow. Uninstalled.;0
Synch across devices is currently broken;0
Well the to-do app was working just fine then you had to go ahead and make improvements and once again you've made the app more useless than it was before what the hell is wrong with you people 😡;0
Recurring reminders feature is not available. Let's say I want to do a particular task every day and want to have a reminder daily. I tried for it using this app but it does not work.;0
sup;0
Does not sync well between devices. Repeatedly forces log in and wipes tasks;0

Using this app lead to Microsoft locking my email account and support won't let me unlock it. Wouldn't recommend this app to anyone.;0
Latest update is rubbish, widgets don't work - not productive because I cannot see my to-do list.;0

Microsoft responded 5/11 with intent to add combined view soon and if the All Smartlist was acceptable workaround. NO, it is no better than the Task or Planned Smartlist.;0
Junk;0
Tried installing it but for no verification code so no install. Poor install experience.;0
I have used this after being forced to migrate from Wunderlist. The Android app works fairly well, but is not a solution when most of your work gets done on a computer. The web app that you end up using together with the Android app is complete garbage. It freezes on sufficiently complex to-do lists under current Chrome and Firefox versions and the developers can't be bothered to fix it. There are other open issues in the forums that never get addressed. This ends up making using the Android app for some use cases (manually reordering recurring tasks) required, as the browser tab will often freeze if you do it on the browser.;0
Big Bug, How can u miss this. When we search by name, it just searches the notes within the lists created. It does search group names, it doesn't search the list title. It searches only the notes (that are within the list) how stupid is that.;0
The widget constantly blanks out and I have to reopen the app to get my lists to show again. This is the only reminders app I've found to do this. Besides that, I really enjoy using this, but having nothing show on my homescreen widget is killing it for me.;0
Mostly OK. Needs option to disallow delete of notifications. Only when the notification is Snoozed or marked as Completed should the notification be cleared. Also, once the notification is deleted there is no way to then go into the app and set a snooze time for the task to realert.;0
I'm disappointed, having lost my data twice because there is a serious lacuna in its program. When I delete a 'daily' item after completing it, it should go into the 'completed' list and its next scheduled occurrence immediately appear in the current list. But at times it doesn't happen like that, and if I've deleted it from the completed list even after some hours, it just disappears for ever. Seems that this action is server-dependent rather than being localized, and on the mercy of internet.;0
Love the app, the synchronization with desktop and shared To Do lists...... BUT this app is almost useless because the reminders don't create notifications if you haven't opened the app for more than a day. More than a dozen times I've checked and rechecked the Android app optimization settings to ensure that Android is not putting this app to sleep. I've cleared cache, data and uninstalled and reinstalled. Still this app will not reliably generate notifications.;0
"Sorry but the migration from Wunderlist made some things worse. The architecture stays the same and this is good but there are some things that are doubtful unfortunately. Why do I need to flag each task to make it appear on ""My Day"" ? If I assign a task for today, I want it to appear already in ""My Day"", otherwise what's the point of this ""My Day""? Not too many customization possibilities, the look of the app is a bit bulk and not so elegant. Some reminders are not working. I hope this can help";0
Bring back Wunderlist! This app has failed to link lists over and over. We find ourselves trying to relink lists, but it still doesn't work. Since this has changed from Wunderlist, it's a huge disappointment. Find a better app. Also, you can't silence it when someone is checking off a linked list (when it does work). Super annoying. I expected more from Microsoft.;0
Unfortunately the app somehow does not actually give you reminders on the time and date you set them. Very disappointing. I had hoped this would be fixed moving from Wunderlist to this replacement. The problem seems to be that whenever you do not complete a task on the due date and leave it as is, the app will no longer remind you of anything. If all your tasks are in the future, it will remind you on that date although it might decide to do so later than planned. Weird ass bug needs a fix.;0
When you create a task and then set a reminder, you have to go back to the text and press enter otherwise it doesn't save it, or even warn you if you navigate away. Caught me out a few times, seriously annoying so looking at other options. Other than that it's ok but nothing special and the views are a bit odd. All for example doesnt actually show all tasks!;0
This is based on Wunderlist, which Microsoft bought a few years ago. They added some nice touches and ate listening to users' suggestions, but it is still a work in progress. They removed too much of what made Wunderlist good. It integrates well with Outlook, though. For now, it's useless for anything but the simplest task management.;0
Hi to Microsoft team, Request # 1: To be able to print a list with only the items marked with an asterisk which are classified in alphabetical order. Request # 2: For all tasks (from all lists) marked with an asterisk and which are all grouped in the same place, these tasks should be displayed in alphabetical order under their respective list (and not grouped in a single list ). And also, have different options to print a single or, all lists (with sorting options). Thank you;0
Used to be great, now it's awful. I use the Widget the most, and have it set to Important to see all my Tasks, not just 1 or 2 per day. Unfortunately, the widget reverts to 'My Day' every time I boot up my phone, and won't switch back. I have to remove the widget from my home screen, then re-add it & switch list to Important - every day! Today was the 5th day of doing this, and I got fed up, so switched to Google Tasks, which is now a much better app than it used to be, & better than To Do.;0
As smart and skilled microsoft employees are this is a great app bu needs a lot of tweaks to be top notch. You camt change the name of a list you create, the completed or i should say deleted items in a list is stupid. If i delete items they should be gone not kept in a completed list that just grows and no delete all button and or not even a choice in settings to either delete items forever without a completed list or to have a completed list that grows and grows single item delete is dumb;0
Still cannot see tasks due today automatically on the widget or on the Live Tile. The overdue tasks are in red now, but still nothing on the ones due today. Who wants to take 10minutes every morning to put all tasks due today and mark them in My Day ? This could be done automatically with an opt-in button in the options, but still nothing.;0
I absolutely love this app & pc program. To be able to keep constant notes between work then mobile in my pocket is fantastic... Until I discovered, I'm not experiencing sync in real time. So down to 2 star and my suggestion to get the app to 5-stars would be if each input would automatically be visibly dated & if real time sync actually was real- time. Needed vital info and thought I could just check the note on my smart phone but, this has not been the case. Wasted a lot of my time & nothing.;0
In general this app works great, but since it switched from Wunderlist to Todo, it now logs out frequently and then the widget will no longer show your lists until you open the whole app again. It happens every few days and across multiple phones. Please fix this;0
"Widget never loads, making it nigh unusable in the way I used Wunderlist prior to the migration. All my lists are updated just fine in-app, but every item is just ""Loading..."" in the widget. Tried removing the widget and adding it again, tried stopping all services, tried re-installing, nothing works.";0
HATE the move of completrd to bottom. I have shopping list in the order the items are as I go round the supermarket, tick as I put in cart, untick as I need again. Used to still be in order when showing completed to untick. Now they are below and in scrambled order there. Should have made change an OPTION. I will have to look for a new To Do app. Very sad. BRING BACK ABILITY TO HAVE COMPLETED ITEMS SHOW IN ORIGINAL POSITIONS IN LIST AMONGST UNCOMPLICATED ITEMS.;0
The invite user feature is horrible. You can only do it through email as the text option doesn't work. I used to be able to select a user in the app and they would be notified in the app. I was a user of Wunderlist and this is a step backwards as far as I can tell.;0
Needs a built in timer and some stats to make it the best productivity to-do out there.. for now it's just a generic to-do with folders. Hoping it gets an update with those features soon as I do love the design and other Microsoft products, for now I'm forced to use another to-do manager. :(;0
This app used to be good when you could add widgets that would show each task you wanted to complete on the home screen. They have since removed that features and you can only add shortcuts to said custom lists. Might as well just use OneNote now. At lest that is used on my PC too.;0
"edit : something more important, please don't make the user logged out after using vpn, it's a pain to log in every time this app is great, but please add the copy list feature on android too, and also ""uncheck all"" feature so i can reuse a routine list without uncheking all one by one";0
"Doesn't allow you to sort completed tasks. I have a single grocery list with 300 tasks in it's completed section that's named by section using tags like ""Produce - onions"". I used to be able to sort completed tasks alphabetically making it easy to have a running list where I could add back frequently purchased items. Now everything is lost automatically placed in completed tasks by completion chronology. Is a pain.";0
It takes too long to update lists. My wife and I share lists, but it takes days, sometimes as long as a week, for changes to show up on each other's lists. The Wonderlist app updated almost immediately. We miss Wonderlist!;0
Widget keeps reverting to my day. It didn't before. Also now often unresponsive. This change is incredibly frustrating. Please fix bugs then happy to upgrade review rating as otherwise us good. Thank you;0
Love the app as I am one of the migrated users from Wanderlist but have been a bit disappointed with the following after using To Do: 1. Option to change from Task list to pure check list. 2. Can't install the App on my PC although it is already on my Android phone.;0
I understand that sometimes you need to replace product. But it beats me why they didnt keep wunderlist and just ditched idea of todo list? Maybe they dont want something that isnt tied to Microsoft? Anyway, app for now sucks, my shared lists from before dont work.. it was my main usage as it was so simple.;0
Desktop and web version is slow, awkward, and useless. App for phone is good. As soon as I have time, I will switch to something else. Makes me miss Wunderlist;0
The App has a lot of functionality but what is the use of flagging your emails but you cannot open the email messages from Microsoft To Do directly in Outlook? It worked well in Wunderlist but since Wunderlist was transferred to Microsoft To Do it doesn't work anymore.;0
Still have it as a temporary solution to keep my Wunderlist todos, but the laggy widget is the show stopper. If you've got used to an almost instant Wunderlist widget sync, just forget about it, most of the time you will need to sync manually;0
UI is good. Easy to use. The only thing that bother me is that the reminder didn't work. That's the basic and important feature of to do app. Missed many task because of this. Please fix it.;0
Find another app. Wunderlist was much better. When you sort alphabetically then prioritize an item, it doesn't move to the top of the list. Wunderlist would allow sorting and when it was starred, move to the top.;0
The text on the notes always gets messy, specifically if you have spaces in between paragraphs or using links. Always gets messed up. Sentences move up and delete the first letters of the paragraphs. Really annoying.;0
Widget has been broken with the latest update, keeps reverting back to the My Day view and then once it does that the button at the top left doesn't work anymore and so can't be switched to show other lists without removing the widget and recreating it, please fix!;0
Can't choose notification tone, has to share the sms tone which is confusing;0
Same old Microsoft. The app does not have independent storage but uses cell phone's gallery for attachments..... No grouping of starred items per list. No assigning task to person. No ability to manually move important list items. NOT GOOD.;0
MTD does not have the email reminder feature, most of the time my reminders don't show in the notification bar, they always did on Wunderlist, etc. Bring Wunderlist back, it's much simpler, more intuitive and has better features.;0
No assistant from support in around one month, still no notifications unless app is open. Cannot be used for reminders. Phone has been reset in this time and app reinstalled , issue persists. Please confirm if this is by design?;0
Great app, but we should be able to customize list image from our device and customize notifications ringtone, anyway it is a good app, it would be great if you add this;0
Wunderlist was an excellent app, used to get my reminders on email. Now I don't get any reminders at all, hence don't see the use of this app. I have checked my phone settings and the app settings and the reminders are on but still no reminders either via app or email;0
In general, the app is confusing. Repeating tasks work for some time and then stop working. I have not found any clear logic behind this. The same problem was with wunderlist. Not recommended.;0
Much slower than Wunderlist, frequent issues with sync (20 seconds to sync after the website is already loaded??) between Android phone and browser version.;0
Application is very good, but the issue in synchronisation. Some times it wasn't sys and I have to sing out and sign in again. It's lose my modified list.;0
Why the comments section is not available yet? As I checked most of users needed it. We had it in wunderlist but here it is not possible to put a comment with recorded date in any list task.;0
"Widget is horrible. Keeps switching to ""my day"" and won't allow me to change it. Really expected better from Microsoft.";0
So, installed this on mac after been a wanderlust user, told me to create Microsoft account so I did. After a day it said session expired, logged back in everything had gone. So thought I'd give this a try, but cannot log in.;0
Not much better than Wunderlist but now it's attached to my Microsoft account for work so I cannot share my personal lists, like the grocery list, with my family.;0
Would be nice if they'd show you overdue tasks, I missed quite a few tasks because I wasn't reminded. Leaving feedback is hard and annoying, too many extra steps.;0
Can't sort via categories. Importance level doesn't sync well. Basically syncing problems all around. Creating new lists don't show in Outlook proper.;0
Widget often becomes empty (after restarting of launcher, for instance). I have to open the app to make widget work. Note 10 + Apex launcher, Tab S6 + Samsung Home launcher.;0
Very useful app. But the widget is not showing my to do list. I have resize then they will appear and again after some time they get disappear;0
This is by far the best To-Do app. I gave it 2 stars because it enforces us to use Microsoft Account for sharing the lists.;0
Repeated to do list do not appear on My day. I missed few. That option should have been there;0
App's widget still doesn't react correctly to dark mode changes. I can't see the list often!!;0
Nice interface and it syncs across my devices. However the widget constantly crashes on both, P30 Pro, Oneplus 7T Pro.;0
Bring back Wunderlist. My list won't sync with people and I'm having issues.;0
Very good application ... Only i facing issues is , it's won't work for offline .;0
Completely broken for synch. Wunderlist actually worked. This is a disaster.;0
Great app but will have to uninstall if they don't sync with google calendar or include a calendar!;0
Nice integration with Teams & Planner. Would get an extra star if I could assign tasks directly from To Do.;0
App is great for the people who forget their tasks. I will be grateful if the company adds alarm reminders in this app.;0
When I went to create an account, I would fill everything out and then I would have to start over. Couldn't even use the app;0
Missing features from Wunderlist. Might need to find a new app.;0
No, because there is no recycle bin. Which is really uncomfortable and insecure. So please add the recycle bin. Which will prevent me from accidentally deleting.;0
As you mentioned, i checked my settings, sound has been enabled yet my reminders dont have sound;0
Just like wunderlist except worse !! Laggy update of list from one device to any.;0
Missing the widget for iOS A to-do/reminder app is incomplete without a widget. Otherwise 5 stars.;0
Difficult login forces work or school address. Lost Wunderlist lists as a result;0
Assigning task is a problem and not available, the reminder is also wanting;0
Impress me with something good that was not here during wunderlist. Thank you for screwing my wunder-lists and making me jump through the hoops of remembering skype password;0
"Widget misbehaves, it keeps switching to ""My day"" and stops reacting to any taps when it does";0
I m facing the i same issue which kenners79(below comment on 9/6/2020) is facing. Widget issue.;0
Desktop widget stops functioning every minute!!;0
"A new ""feature"" of Microsoft To Do compared to Wunderlist is notifications being cleared at the start of every new day. This is incredibly annoying because if I don't have time to get to it, I want it to be a constant annoying reminder so I know to get around to it. I would rather continue to use Wunderlist, if the recurring tasks was implemented offline, instead of requiring the server to give you a recursive task.";0
At first I liked that I could choose to see or hide the done tasks and even the done tasks were on alphabetic order. I use this app also as a grocery list. So every time I want to add the done tasks I have to go throw everything. Why can't you have the done tasks in alphabetic order as well. Or that we could choose between this interface and the previous one ourselves. The way it is now (chaotic) it is very user unfriendly and time consuming.;0
I switched over to Microsoft to do after being notified that Wunderlist would not be available. With the most recent update to the app, the 'planned' list now only shows a filtered view. And I have to group it by date to even see it for each day. Previously I could see everything at once -by due date even overdue items. I can appreciate that everyone might not want to see everything. There should be an 'all' option if you are going to limit this. Looks like I get to find a new app.;0
Actually wasn't a terrible replacement for Wunderlist until the last update. The one feature I used all the time was the ability to show completed items with un-completed and sort the whole list and then hide completed items again, leaving everything sorted. Now you can no longer merge the lists and sort. Why take something out that was actually useful? Now this app is virtually useless for me.;0
Everything is three colors: black, white, and bg color. Nothing feels separate or distinct, meaning I find it hard to visually separate individual tasks. To do lists should help me break down tasks not make them feel like a uniform lump. The star shouldn't be the same color as the background if it's supposed to stand out. Please make the star stand out more with a banner like Wunderlist and with a different color.;0
"I don't know if anyone else is experiencing this, but the app glitches CONSTANTLY with Chrome OS. Whenever I flip to ""My Day,"" the suggested tasks flicker on the screen and make using the app impossible. I used it on my Android phone and previously on my Macbook with no problem. I loved the ""My Day"" function and am loathe to switch to a different app, but I don't think I have a choice.";0
I am quite disappointed that the sorting no longer applies to completed tasks. After years of missing this feature in Wunderlist, it was a very positive surprise seeing that it had been implemented in To-Do. Now it's gone again. If this change is not reverted, I will be dropping the app. It's a nice app but it doesn't serve me without that feature.;0
Update a step backwards. The one thing I hated about Wunderlist was the inability to sort completed items alphabetically. When Microsoft To Do took over I was thrilled that you could hide/unhide completed items in to list and sort them all alphabetically. For some perplexing reason, Microsoft took a couple steps backwards in functionality by going back to the Wunderlist way. Bad choice, please put it back.;0
"-Don't reset the ""My Day"" list each day, or at least let me turn off that behavior. -Allow tasks to belong to more than one list. -Add a persistent, high-priority reminder that will not stop beeping every x minutes until the associated task is complete. T";0
A fantastic and helpful app became useless with the last update. Grouping open and completed tasks may be helpful for some, but for some types of lists it would be really handy to have all tasks together. For example a picking list (or shopping list) with the items sorted in order of their position in the warehouse. You do not need everything every time, so you can just uncheck the items when needed during a round, possibly hiding the completed tasks to minimize screen cluttering. This was possible before, but with the recent update(s) all completed tasks have moved to a separate list. All custom sorting is lost. Dear Microsoft, please re enable these features. You could provide an option in settings to use one or the other. (Maybe even on a list level) 2 stars because it used to be a good app, otherwise I would have now given it only 1 star.;0
What a terrible replacement for Wunderlist! My husband and I have been using Wunderlist for years to coordinate all types of lists around the house. With To Do, we haven't been able to find a way to share lists directly between the app on our phone. You have to go through a browser to join a list - FAIL.;0
The planned view week filter doesn't include overdue items in the same view - this was a feature Wunderlist had and it made it easy to track tasks in a single view. The tasks are not sorted in the week view in the same way Wunderlist did, I expected to see tasks organized by due date -> list name -> task title but I get tasks due on the same date ordered randomly.;0
Give us options I was dismayed to discover that the latest update decided to move all my completed tasks on a list to the bottom - and they are in a reverse sort order. For most of my lists I liked seeing all the items together. I can see possibilities with this new view, but please let the user choose.;0
"I am liking the app so far except for the fact that you can only add tasks to ""My Day"" for the present day. I LOVE the idea of a daily list, but it would be immensely better if you could plan for future days. It's super inconvenient to have to add all your tasks the morning of...";0
Wunderlist migration/ Don't like Microsoft To Do. I really miss Wunderlist. I miss when I would save a link to Wunderlist and it would let me select the list I needed, not so in To-do. I'm trying to figure out how to leave To-Do for Trello or Todist. This is a bummer. Might just leave my stuff in To-Do and start all over again.;0
This app changed recently in an annoying way. Now, completed tasks are no longer sorted or even sort-able. We use this app for shopping lists and have previously appreciated the ability to sort a list we use repeatedly in alphabetical order. Now it's impossible to sort the completed taske for reuse. That's just lame.;0
Widget continues to stop working nothing shows up until I resize it.;0
Recently it crashes in background;0
Looks good, imported fine from wunderlist, but will not sync with my desktop pc on windows 10. Huge disappointment and has affected productivity. Its in its early stages as an app so ill cut them a little slack, unfortunately my clients will not. Here is hoping it gets sorted.;0
Wont sync w my crew. I have to cut and paste lists. Wunderlist was seemless;0
REALLY miss Wunderlist. This just feels like a list of work I have to do rather than a list of possibilities from which to choose. To Do is a clunky PC type office app. Wunderlist was a fun life mobile app. I'll be looking for an alternative to To Do.;0
Migrating from Wunderlist but to be honest with zero integration with google calendar as Wunderlist had...this does not work for me. Off to todoist which has full integration. Really don't understand why you would close Wunderlist before having the same features in ToDo...;0
"Came from Wunderlist and, to no surprise, Microsoft has managed to cause issues. My wife and I create ""tasks"" as shopping lists and they take quite a bit longer to sync than they used to if they even sync at all.";0
This is better if it has calendar to help decide and organize planning and time managing;0
What have you done to this app? Just had to re-organise 'My Day' list for the second time in one day! Some future date lists seem to have disappeared 🤔. Please restore the parts removed. Otherwise top of my To Do list will be to find a new To Do list app! 🤨;0
After being forced to move from simple and great Wunderlist, after great 4 years of user experience, I was expecting this app to be at least as good as Wunderlist for my need and said let's give it a go. But, of course it's not as good. Only thing that I used Wunderlist for and how I planned to use To Do is one shared list for groceries shopping. First, I imported list from Wunderlist since it has active/unfinished items but couldn't get to have wife join the list after I shared it, so i had to create new list on my phone from To Do, move active items from imported list to this new list, share it and now it works. So, sharing imported list doesn't work. And most annoying is that shared list is not refreshed in widget after some action from another user until app is opened. Since this was the way we used list, through widget, and widgets are there so that we don't have to open app every time we want to do something with the app, if this is not fixed I don't see us using this anymore because I don't want to open app every time I get notification that something changed. Since this was working in Wunderlist I don't see a reason for it not to work on To Do. I checked if app is asking for some additional permissions for this to work, but it's not so I don't see what else can I do.;0
A bit too bare bones for me, but I assume if you use your Microsoft account for business a lot, you may like this.;0
@Microsoft you've made wunderlist worse, where is the comments feature on each task, that was a win for wunderlist and you just killed it;0
Mostly OK. Needs option to disallow delete of notifications. Only when the notification is Snoozed or marked as Completed should the notification be cleared. Also, once the notification is deleted there is no way to then go into the app and set a snooze time for the task to realert.;0
Recently it crashes in background;0
Great app, but we should be able to customize list image from our device and customize notifications ringtone, anyway it is a good app, it would be great if you add this;0
Big Bug, How can u miss this. When we search by name, it just searches the notes within the lists created. It does search group names, it doesn't search the list title. It searches only the notes (that are within the list) how stupid is that.;0
No, because there is no recycle bin. Which is really uncomfortable and insecure. So please add the recycle bin. Which will prevent me from accidentally deleting.;0
The widget constantly blanks out and I have to reopen the app to get my lists to show again. This is the only reminders app I've found to do this. Besides that, I really enjoy using this, but having nothing show on my homescreen widget is killing it for me.;0
Can't Sync I am unable to sync my phone account to PC account;0
Can't choose notification tone, has to share the sms tone which is confusing;0
Widget keeps reverting to my day. It didn't before. Also now often unresponsive. This change is incredibly frustrating. Please fix bugs then happy to upgrade review rating as otherwise us good. Thank you;0
Horrible app. I'm a big Microsoft fan for their products, but Google keep is 100 times better.;0
I'm disappointed, having lost my data twice because there is a serious lacuna in its program. When I delete a 'daily' item after completing it, it should go into the 'completed' list and its next scheduled occurrence immediately appear in the current list. But at times it doesn't happen like that, and if I've deleted it from the completed list even after some hours, it just disappears for ever. Seems that this action is server-dependent rather than being localized, and on the mercy of internet.;0
Doesn't respect silent mode.;0
Repeated to do list do not appear on My day. I missed few. That option should have been there;0
As smart and skilled microsoft employees are this is a great app bu needs a lot of tweaks to be top notch. You camt change the name of a list you create, the completed or i should say deleted items in a list is stupid. If i delete items they should be gone not kept in a completed list that just grows and no delete all button and or not even a choice in settings to either delete items forever without a completed list or to have a completed list that grows and grows single item delete is dumb;0
App is great for the people who forget their tasks. I will be grateful if the company adds alarm reminders in this app.;0
In general this app works great, but since it switched from Wunderlist to Todo, it now logs out frequently and then the widget will no longer show your lists until you open the whole app again. It happens every few days and across multiple phones. Please fix this;0
Not easy to use. And doesn't do a good job of keeping reminders;0
I guess once you get the instructions you realize that a calendar app preinstalled is more effective.;0
Como que eu configuro uma tarefa para ser realizada todas as terças e quartas? Se não é possível fazer isso adicionando apenas uma tarefa precisa melhorar urgentemente;0
Desktop and web version is slow, awkward, and useless. App for phone is good. As soon as I have time, I will switch to something else. Makes me miss Wunderlist;0
Very useful app. But the widget is not showing my to do list. I have resize then they will appear and again after some time they get disappear;0
Love the app, the synchronization with desktop and shared To Do lists...... BUT this app is almost useless because the reminders don't create notifications if you haven't opened the app for more than a day. More than a dozen times I've checked and rechecked the Android app optimization settings to ensure that Android is not putting this app to sleep. I've cleared cache, data and uninstalled and reinstalled. Still this app will not reliably generate notifications.;0
"edit : something more important, please don't make the user logged out after using vpn, it's a pain to log in every time this app is great, but please add the copy list feature on android too, and also ""uncheck all"" feature so i can reuse a routine list without uncheking all one by one";0

The App has a lot of functionality but what is the use of flagging your emails but you cannot open the email messages from Microsoft To Do directly in Outlook? It worked well in Wunderlist but since Wunderlist was transferred to Microsoft To Do it doesn't work anymore.;0
Good thing it's free, else who would pay? As a fan of Microsoft products, the development of this app is disappointing. It's nothing but average. If the developers can just pick the top task management apps in the play store and add their features into this Todo app, perhaps the development could be accelerated. But right now, it's just like every other low-end Todo apps available, not robust, not feature rich, not exceptional.;0
Difficult login forces work or school address. Lost Wunderlist lists as a result;0
Wunderlist was better;0
Does not store none tasks information well.;0
Great app but will have to uninstall if they don't sync with google calendar or include a calendar!;0
Bring back Wunderlist! This app has failed to link lists over and over. We find ourselves trying to relink lists, but it still doesn't work. Since this has changed from Wunderlist, it's a huge disappointment. Find a better app. Also, you can't silence it when someone is checking off a linked list (when it does work). Super annoying. I expected more from Microsoft.;0
Nice interface and it syncs across my devices. However the widget constantly crashes on both, P30 Pro, Oneplus 7T Pro.;0
Same old Microsoft. The app does not have independent storage but uses cell phone's gallery for attachments..... No grouping of starred items per list. No assigning task to person. No ability to manually move important list items. NOT GOOD.;0
"Widget misbehaves, it keeps switching to ""My day"" and stops reacting to any taps when it does";0
Thanks for ruining Wunderlist you jackasses;0
This is better if it has calendar to help decide and organize planning and time managing;0

Forced to review to avoid popups every few days. Ok so far;0
When you create a task and then set a reminder, you have to go back to the text and press enter otherwise it doesn't save it, or even warn you if you navigate away. Caught me out a few times, seriously annoying so looking at other options. Other than that it's ok but nothing special and the views are a bit odd. All for example doesnt actually show all tasks!;0

I m facing the i same issue which kenners79(below comment on 9/6/2020) is facing. Widget issue.;0
This app used to be good when you could add widgets that would show each task you wanted to complete on the home screen. They have since removed that features and you can only add shortcuts to said custom lists. Might as well just use OneNote now. At lest that is used on my PC too.;0

App's widget still doesn't react correctly to dark mode changes. I can't see the list often!!;0
Too complicated;0
The text on the notes always gets messy, specifically if you have spaces in between paragraphs or using links. Always gets messed up. Sentences move up and delete the first letters of the paragraphs. Really annoying.;0
This is based on Wunderlist, which Microsoft bought a few years ago. They added some nice touches and ate listening to users' suggestions, but it is still a work in progress. They removed too much of what made Wunderlist good. It integrates well with Outlook, though. For now, it's useless for anything but the simplest task management.;0
Very good application ... Only i facing issues is , it's won't work for offline .;0
In general, the app is confusing. Repeating tasks work for some time and then stop working. I have not found any clear logic behind this. The same problem was with wunderlist. Not recommended.;0
Used to be great, now it's awful. I use the Widget the most, and have it set to Important to see all my Tasks, not just 1 or 2 per day. Unfortunately, the widget reverts to 'My Day' every time I boot up my phone, and won't switch back. I have to remove the widget from my home screen, then re-add it & switch list to Important - every day! Today was the 5th day of doing this, and I got fed up, so switched to Google Tasks, which is now a much better app than it used to be, & better than To Do.;0
Needs a built in timer and some stats to make it the best productivity to-do out there.. for now it's just a generic to-do with folders. Hoping it gets an update with those features soon as I do love the design and other Microsoft products, for now I'm forced to use another to-do manager. :(;0
"Widget never loads, making it nigh unusable in the way I used Wunderlist prior to the migration. All my lists are updated just fine in-app, but every item is just ""Loading..."" in the widget. Tried removing the widget and adding it again, tried stopping all services, tried re-installing, nothing works.";0
The invite user feature is horrible. You can only do it through email as the text option doesn't work. I used to be able to select a user in the app and they would be notified in the app. I was a user of Wunderlist and this is a step backwards as far as I can tell.;0
Wunderlist was an excellent app, used to get my reminders on email. Now I don't get any reminders at all, hence don't see the use of this app. I have checked my phone settings and the app settings and the reminders are on but still no reminders either via app or email;0
Still cannot see tasks due today automatically on the widget or on the Live Tile. The overdue tasks are in red now, but still nothing on the ones due today. Who wants to take 10minutes every morning to put all tasks due today and mark them in My Day ? This could be done automatically with an opt-in button in the options, but still nothing.;0
Can't use without a MS account. Improved sync. Widget doesn't allow you to chose which list you'd like to see without going into the app.;0
Failed to arrange my tasks by dragging them as used to do with Wunderlist;0
Why the comments section is not available yet? As I checked most of users needed it. We had it in wunderlist but here it is not possible to put a comment with recorded date in any list task.;0
It takes too long to update lists. My wife and I share lists, but it takes days, sometimes as long as a week, for changes to show up on each other's lists. The Wonderlist app updated almost immediately. We miss Wonderlist!;0
Application is very good, but the issue in synchronisation. Some times it wasn't sys and I have to sing out and sign in again. It's lose my modified list.;0
I understand that sometimes you need to replace product. But it beats me why they didnt keep wunderlist and just ditched idea of todo list? Maybe they dont want something that isnt tied to Microsoft? Anyway, app for now sucks, my shared lists from before dont work.. it was my main usage as it was so simple.;0
So so sad 😭 I LOVED Wunderlist. I used it to share lists with co workers, daily tasks and grocery lists. Now that it's linked to Microsoft I can no longer use without creating an email account with them:( I'm so bummed! It would be great if there was an option to use the app without creating an email account.;0
Had to retract my initial positive review as after longer use I started to spot issues, mainly notifications don't work at all. Even after whitelisting the app in battery management.;0
Nice integration with Teams & Planner. Would get an extra star if I could assign tasks directly from To Do.;0
"Sorry but the migration from Wunderlist made some things worse. The architecture stays the same and this is good but there are some things that are doubtful unfortunately. Why do I need to flag each task to make it appear on ""My Day"" ? If I assign a task for today, I want it to appear already in ""My Day"", otherwise what's the point of this ""My Day""? Not too many customization possibilities, the look of the app is a bit bulk and not so elegant. Some reminders are not working. I hope this can help";0
I have finally given up with this Application. Although it works ok on its own not being part of Outlook (calendar & mail) on my Andoid phone is a drag. If I put a To Do into my calendar I like to also add it to my to do list but having to run this as a second stand alone app is far from ideal. On my Windows phone it was integrated into Outlook as it is on the PC. Why isn't it part of Outlook?;0
Assigning task is a problem and not available, the reminder is also wanting;0
Not much better than Wunderlist but now it's attached to my Microsoft account for work so I cannot share my personal lists, like the grocery list, with my family.;0
So, installed this on mac after been a wanderlust user, told me to create Microsoft account so I did. After a day it said session expired, logged back in everything had gone. So thought I'd give this a try, but cannot log in.;0
Another shity microlimp product. They can't even copy a decent app.;0
Hi to Microsoft team, Request # 1: To be able to print a list with only the items marked with an asterisk which are classified in alphabetical order. Request # 2: For all tasks (from all lists) marked with an asterisk and which are all grouped in the same place, these tasks should be displayed in alphabetical order under their respective list (and not grouped in a single list ). And also, have different options to print a single or, all lists (with sorting options). Thank you;0
Looks good, imported fine from wunderlist, but will not sync with my desktop pc on windows 10. Huge disappointment and has affected productivity. Its in its early stages as an app so ill cut them a little slack, unfortunately my clients will not. Here is hoping it gets sorted.;0
No assistant from support in around one month, still no notifications unless app is open. Cannot be used for reminders. Phone has been reset in this time and app reinstalled , issue persists. Please confirm if this is by design?;0
MTD does not have the email reminder feature, most of the time my reminders don't show in the notification bar, they always did on Wunderlist, etc. Bring Wunderlist back, it's much simpler, more intuitive and has better features.;0
If Google Calendar integration was available with this app, it'd be loads better. Apart from that it's great. I've been using it for a while alongside other apps like Anydo and Todoist. They have a few features that I hope Microsoft builds into this app, but on the whole, I like this the most. It's simple, you can export your lists, and you can create steps for tasks.;1
Good basic list maker. There were many updates made since its inception and I look forward to what lies ahead. It is missing the ability to organize your lists and folders alphabetically. Also it's odd that when I'm moving a list, it gives me all the other lists instead of the folder. I'm sure this will be corrected soon.;1
Great way to keep track of everything I have to do. I can create different groups of tasks and then select items from each of them to add to today's list and the ones I don't complete are easily seen tomorrow when creating that daily list. I just wish I could prioritize with numbers (1, 2, 3 ...) and not just stars.;1
Excellent work done by the Microsoft team, really wonderful. Just want a few upgrades, have an option to set a particular list or smart list as home-screen i.e. whenever we open the app we are directly directed to our selected list. And other is that make the app icon interesting, it is very much simple.;1
Maybe I don't understand the purpose, but Starred Items still do not appear on the top of my Planned list. I reported this months ago and was informed it was being worked on but multiple upgrades have occurred and checking the option, does nothing to the position of starred items. I have swapped the switches and reinstalled app.;1
Good app. They finally fixed the major issues around linking it to your Outlook account. I like the My Day functionality. Adding subtasks works great! Works on all my platforms seamlessly. Allows and remembers user sorting of tasks for those that go in an order. Very well done!;1
Almost perfect.. only two things still missing: category (one taks can be appear in multiple list) and scheduled task can be displayed/appear in calendar on the date of completion target.;1
I have been using this app for a week now. It is wonderful. However few suggestions, manager i should be able to see how many assigned task is given to the college;1
If I move a task higher in a list. Same task should also get higher in My day list also.. That's it.. Thumbs up to microsoft...;1
I don't miss Wunderlist. This app is great. The only thing it doesn't have is integration with Google Assistant. That would be great. Otherwise this is super.;1
I converted from Wunderlist to the Microsoft To Do and the transition has been quite easy. I really loved Wunderlist, but this app mirrors many of the functions, and particularly the ones I use most, for lists and list sharing. The performance has been consistent and easy to use. I'm very glad the Wunderlist/ now Microsoft team was able to model To Do as closely as possible to the excellent Wunderlist app, plus add some new features. I definitely recommend it. Thanks for all your hard work. PG;1
It is easy. Would love to have more sort options. But I keep a lot of lists and keeps me organized.;1
A good app, gives me the chance to save my completed tasks amongst my documents on windows for easy recall at a later date when I've got to repeat a task some time later. The negatives are: 1. on each task, any text entered on 'next step', doesn't show on the task in Microsoft Outlook. 2. There is no way of categorising your tasks, other than creating folders and switching between folders. 3. Woking with attachments on tasks using my Live mailbox is diffacult, attachments can't always be opened;1
Didn't used to be a good replacement for Wunderlist, but now it's close. Navigation and UI are great, lists are very useful and easy to organize. My only beefs are lack of control over notifications for shared lists (notification every time a list item is added, completed, etc.), and with Wunderlist you used to be able to invite people to a shared list without using a 3rd party app if they were already a user... annoying to have to text/message links when i've previously shared lists with...;1
I am not able to link my gmail and Yahoo emails with it. If this feature is present please have a look at the problem and if this feature is absent please add it it makes tasks more easier.;1
As always best productivity solution from Microsoft. Wish if the developers include the feature to show the flagged emails from Gmail or other IMAP accounts that are configured in Outlook to show in the app. It will be more powerful then to mark the important mails in Outlook and see them in To Do as a task for the day or as scheduled. If they do i will mark the app as 5 star.;1
Very good application. Syncs well across devices and is reliable for intense use. Would like to see some evolution of the app from this point such as: #. Improved handling using keystrokes for speed #. Font resizing #. Add 'Yesterday' to 'Today' #. Bulk updates #. Time selector is non-standard and should be consistent Very good overall but the above would improve in my opinion.;1
I love this app! Works great! Only two update requests.... 1. Allow longer text for information entry 2. When we have an item that repeats, such weekly, make it now adjust next repeat date to one week from date completed. Not one week from due date originally set. If the task is late for completion. Or at least have the app ask if it should adjust next repeat;1
Adding a star. I like the step feature that used to be sublists so i can gauge project completion. Adding another star, I'm getting used to the interface. Could you make a special type of list or sublist that has a number such as $1000 where i can add an item or something that has an amount associated with it like $50 and then the $1000 will become $950? I will give 5 stars if you do this.;1
This app has changed my life. I have ADHD and this app allows me to have control over the the things I want to do in my life. Some small critiques would be to add sub lists within other lists i.e. a groceries list with seperate store lists with in. And the ability to move a task from one list to another would be helpful.;1
Good app, use it on laptop and mobile device. Suggest to add option to export all (incl completed) to Excel or csv.;1
I've been using this app for at least 4 or 5 years now (when it was Wunderlist and now as Microsoft To Do). I use it constantly for weekly lists, groceries, and it has been wonderful for keeping track of odds and ends over time like books I want to read, music to listen to, etc. I like that you can attach documents. Only downside is I wish I could customize it more with different color schemes. Overall, very user-friendly.;1
"Good home management app. My husband and I share a few different lists, like shopping, tasks, movies, etc, and it works for us. It's not a 5 stars because when I tried to use it as a personal daily task list, I wasn't all that satisfied. I would expect uncompleted ""day tasks"" to remain visible for the next day, or recurring weekly items which you completed this week, to disappear from your to-do list until the following recurrence.";1
Does what it does very well. This review is with mixed feelings because, I feel the user interface of Wunderlist is better...;1
When I enter in the task, I need to view it in full window. You're not giving this opportunity. Because of that, I cannot see it as i see in outlook: full information. The right colum is missing... Please, allow tasks view in full window.;1
Overall this is a great app for keeping track of what I need to do. Easy to use interface and clean layout. However, there is one big thing I wish they'd change. Pros: Clean layout Easy to use Good organization with different lists Cons: Can't change default alert options-- when you want an alert that's not one of the three default options, you have to change it manually every time you add a new task Would also like the ability to customize snooze durations;1
Better than many apps, but needs some more features for becoming best. I miss: 1. Add button at Home Screen. 2. Tags, which makes grouping of tasks easy. There is workaround provided, but it would be easier to use if direct Tags are provided. 3. In case task is to call someone, it would be easier to provide access to contact or phone number at the task itself. For the above reasons only 4 stars.;1
I really like this app, doesn't give me any trouble. If something happens to my device I don't lose any information because it's link to my account, easy to use and. Although, I would like that in a future update to have the option to order my tasks by alarm/date time, no due day, that's already there, but the alarm and date that I set the task.;1
I loved Wunderlist, and after its unfortunate demise I switched to ToDoist. Have to admit that it is a superior app, but its pricing is a little too much for a to-do app. This one, on the other hand, is free, yet offers much of the same functionality, except for *any* intuitive reminders. What's up with to-do apps and reminders these days? Dear developers, please, I'm begging you, add the basic @time recognition, I'm sure it's something that we've all been missing since Wunderlist.;1
I use it for my grocery list. Now the completed items are moved to the bottom. I kind of like that except for the order the completed items are in. I need them to stay in alphabetical order so I can easily find items. It's so aggrevating to skim back and forth looking for something that I need to uncheck. Please fix! Update: They fixed the sort for completed tasks. Very nice now. Thank you!;1
Overall, the app is super handy amd I use it on a daily basis to keep a track of plans. I enjoy you can both see you completed and still not tasks on one page. However, the app's widget started to lag quite often what is annoying. It get stuck when you try to add first tasks for the day and tasks' suggesting scroll-up ribbon start to hover and there is no other way to stop except from exit. Also sometimes the widget simply doesn't show tasks at all in a window and get stuck. Please, fix it!!!🙏;1
Best to-do app on the play store. I only have one problem with the app, in my phone If I swipe left at a task by mistake then it directly gets deleted without asking for confirmation even when I have selected the option in settings. The same works correctly in my laptop's windows 10 app. Please fix this bug otherwise the app is perfect.;1
"Not much to say here. It's good. Pros • Syncs with your PC via the cloud. A must have nowadays. • Interfaces with OneNote via links in the ""Add File"" section. I use both - that's good. • Displays schedule on mobile home screen. I find Task display best for mobile and Planner display best for PC. • Subtopics are nice if you have a list of things that need too get done under a main topic. • Alarm set separately from due date • Color change or separate listing for overdue items. [I love deadlines. I love the whooshing sound they make as they go by.] Cons • No snooze on mobile. Mobile - alarm rings once (softly) and does not repeat for that notification. It would be nice if you could set it to go off every 10 minutes or so until you tell it to shut up. It does leave notifications in the notification bar. • I don’t see any way to set alarm sound or duration or volume on mobile.";1
Changing from wunderlist I was concerned it wouldn't be as good. I'm increasingly appreciating this app. Seems big improvements were made to it to reflect some of wunderlist best features. Thanks for the work put in to achieve this.;1
I like it. My go-to to-do app. Would love custom sorting. Web portal needs to be more consistent with app. Would love ability to easily drag/drop pictures into notes. I mainly use this, OneNote and Google Keep. Easy picture snags would make it almost perfect. Maybe added organization with oprional folder structure too.;1
Fantastic task list. They took the best of Wunderlist and improved on it. The only thing I'd like to see is a change in the default reschedule options. It always provided the same options that I really use. I'd love it to earn from my previous rescheduling. It would save a lot of clicks.;1
Very straightforward tool...easy to use.....which makes it a strong personal organizing tool. Half the battle is using a tool to get organized, focused and productive and the simplicity of this tools ease of use makes it very powerful!;1
Great app. I just wish it could be more interactive such that memebers in a shared task could chat among them selves without leaving the app;1
The last few updates have the functionality going in the right direction. Well done MS keep up the good work.;1
#Update: The feature to sort alphabetically the COMPLETED tasks is back. Thank you for listening. Last review: After the last update or so, an important feature was removed: Being able to sort alphabetically the COMPLETED tasks in a list. That was THE feature! Why in the world Microsoft removed this feature? That was a TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE decision. I really hope it returns soon otherwise I'll need to look for another app.;1
I like it because I liked wunderlist. However, i hate that it's Microsoft account based. Let's face it, we don't use microsoft apps that much so I can never remember my password. It's a hassle during times when the app logs out for some reason. It was so convenient when it was google based before and all i'll have to do this is click sign it with google and voila.;1
It's free and does what most other to-do list apps can't do. For one, you can get reminders which you'll have to pay for if you use Todoist. I loved Wunderlist and now that Microsoft bought them over, I get the Wunderlist experience and some more. I like how Microsoft To Do integrates with Microsoft Planner and Microsoft Outlook. It makes organising my tasks a whole lot easier. Only thing I would add is tags. That would make this app perfect.;1
Excellent to-do list application. Syncs reliably and allows me to add and check off tasks from my phone or my computer easily. The only feature lacking is the ability to assign a time of day, not just a due date, to a task. Sometimes I have tasks that need to be done by a certain time (e.g. online assignments) and it would help if they could be organized automatically in order of time of day they are due on a particular day. Other than that, no complaints at all! 10/10 would recommend.;1
This is likely one of the best built Microsoft apps on every platform, if not the best. Fluid and fast, easy to navigate, clean UI, and very functional. It's a shame there's so much inconsistency with Microsoft's app development because the other teams should take note.;1
Decent job replacing my beloved Wunderlist. Thanks for implementing most of the useful features that I loved in Wunderlist!;1
Increase text field length of add step. Allow reordering of steps Change add step to simply add. Also add task to add or have custom field in setting to define what you are adding eg add word if list of words. Getting better. New items at the top completed at the bottom. Working with it again now.;1
I used the previous app, called wunderlist and liked it very much. This newer version serves the key purpose of managing and creating several task lists. You can organize your task lists by nesting them under categories that you create. Good: > Able to collaborative lists with your spouse, or others, once you invite them via email > Can set reminders > The Microsoft To Do list version home page called, 'My Day' gives a nice overview of your tasks Bad: Please make it simpler to edit lists;1
Overall perform as the Wunderlist, some improvement that can make it a 5star: 1) at the completed task list, have the option to show completed task list segregated by dates instead of showing the whole chunk. Need to know which day complete which task in a easier way. 2) Under Planned, segregate the task list base on each week (including past weeks and future weeks of unfinished task), instead jus only show the current week. This will give immediate bird eye view of each week plan tasklist;1
I just downloaded this yesterday and I am enjoying this app so far. Especially the sound after you finished a specific task. I am happy that I found this app. I will use this for work and everyday goals. Thanks! 😊;1
"Surprisingly decent app from Microsoft. Syncs on Android and Windows. Able to make multiple lists. Nice design. Easy ways to add additional items. Wish there was a option for ""tomorrow"" list that would auto move to my day list on the next day. A way to remove all completed apps in a list or multiple lists at same time would be helpful.";1
Well, its a nice app. Simple, possibly simplest it could get. I enjoy using it and also helped me a lot. But the app could do more with reminders and also the look of it. Reminders could be with alarms and also the looks can be a little more detailed. Would be a lot better if we had better home screen with icons and graphics instead of lists etc. I would have given 5 stars if it had more looks and graphics to ease out the stress instead of lists of letters and tasks ......;1
"A number of features are still needed: 1. allow copying of steps from one task to all tasks in a list, may be even in other lists as well 2. allow ""sort by"" assignees within a list 3. allow using ""@"" to mark a specific assignee in the ""add note"" field of a task and that person can receive a ping in his app 4. add feature where the owner of a list can see all lists/ tasks assigned to a specific persons 5.add the feature of allowing the owner of lists to see the work done by assignees on that day";1
I am enjoying the grouping of lists, the dark mode and the recurring tasks my only frustration is that if i'm offline and I click complete on a repeating task the next instance doesn't show up. I have to be online when I click complete for the task to change it's due date to the next instance and I don't want to always be online when completing tasks. I haven't found anything else wrong with it for my needs.;1
I made the switch from wunderlist and its basically the same, w/ some extra features. One thing I'm missing tho is the widget wunderlist had, like the search bar for quick adding of a new note. It does have the option to have that when pulling down the screen for settings. But i preferred the wunderlist widget. Otherwise it's great :);1
Good app to manage list out plan and review your to do. It works like a dashboard and main thing is you can assign the work to your team mates. It includes the features like adding step by step within work and comments and not only that but we can attach the related documents as well. Only the face view there should have been option to see as tiles and the work list should show the time as well. Currently we can see only the list of today tom but the time reflected there would make more useful;1
Been using this app for a while as an University student and I am more organized than ever, however there is an issue that bothers me. When reminding a task on Desktop To Do or Online version it does not update on the mobile version and does not remind unless I manually open the mobile version so it updates the reminder. Other than that, I have just what I need.;1
Good reskin of Wunderlist. Bonus for keeping it ads and cost free. Still buggy with repeated tasks. When a repeated task is completed, sub-tasks don't always reset. And kept Wunderlist limit to only one level of sub-tasks, which I hope you will improve.;1
"Great overall. Annoying that notifications can't be more fine tuned. I would like to be able to choose the type of notifications as some are very useful and others are just irritating eg ""yesterday you only complete 0 of 3 tasks""";1
I like this app a lot its simple, clean and free. However it doesnt hold a candle to Nine and desperately needs a dark theme as well as some translucency options for the widget. Additionally there's no way to filter by status. Is it too much to ask a productivity tool to be able to display things by status?;1
Its really a good app. Worth using. Everything is fine but I found a problem : it notifies tasks with a notification sound not a music tone. So one not even know if it has notified if the person is a bit far away from the phone. That's it.;1
Works fine. But, a glaring let down is the lack of tags. When your tasks grow and multiply, there should a way to find the tasks that you are trying to get at. There should be a way other than search to find your tasks. Tags are a must.;1
Love it, especially the shared lists. Taking one star away as I think a search function could be a great addition for long lists. So you don't have to scroll down through to find an old item;1
My wife and I use this for grocery lists, household needs, Christmas/gift lists, to do lists, and we share them seamlessly across both Android and Apple platforms. I would give it five, but moving from Wunderlist to this made us create new lists and our old lists stopped syncing.;1
The app does what it says across devices. Would love a feature to add colours to the list to sort them out as per urgency. Another feature could be to give formatting options for text for additional notes within a set task.;1
"The newly revamped planned section is a definite improvement (showing current and overdue tasks). although the the new planned all section is great, i still feel like I miss having the week view, including overdue tasks. having that view helps narrow my view. I also feel that reminders are still finicky. I miss the wndrlst function that auto assigns reminder on same due date. recurring notifications dont update with new date keep up the good work and i hope to see an update to ""this week"" view";1
Good experience except that once I tried to return something to the main list and it wouldn't go. It showed on the checked list but when I tried to return it it wouldn't go and finally disappeared. And I can't figure out how to delete an item altogether.;1
Very useful but let me remove ads! Or at least dont allow noisy video ads.;1
It's so useful! My husband and I can collaborate on the grocery list, household to-do's, baby name ideas and more! Minus one star for the less than intuitive way of deleting items and lists, and it would be neat to be able to have subcategories within lists (i.e. separating the grocery list by department).;1
The only thing missing is the canvas view, so I give a 4 of 5. Other apps that I used before you could have libraries/folders/projects on a mosaic view. My conclussion is that it's a great app and I most love the option of My day, makes really easy to identify and list task that you would like to deal with on the day.;1
Excellent replacement for Wunderlist! A nice feature would be to automatically delete completed tasks from certain lists...or an option to print only the active list. On my iPad I nearly hit print with 400 pages of completed tasks! Other than that it's perfect.;1
We used to use (Wunderlist) for the past few years as a printing house team.. We switched to (to do) all is good.. Only 1 small issue is not available.. And it's a bit Important (SORT BY ASSIGNIES) If this can be fixed it would have been much better.;1
Truly amazing app for me. This is exactly what I needed. The colors and themes make me finish my tasks actually. I'll ask you to have the option to set theme from our gallery. Thank you;1
If the Important list can be sorted by Category, that will be great! Wunderlist used to have this function, I don't why it has been moved... 😌 Otherwise, fairly good app!!! Thank you 🌻;1
Good, handy app. I use it all the time. I liked its previous incarnation Wunderlist better because the home page didn't start with the annoying, unremovable five categories that Microsoft added. Believe it or not, there is life outside of work for a lot of people.;1
Loved the app. It's so simple. I have been searching for such simple app, for this tasks thing, for years. Just one thing. Please show 'creation date/time' of each task when the tasks are shown in the tasks list. It will just make it perfect.;1
Nested of a single task is an amazing features. Has a slot to update the widget's layout, design, features. 'My day', separating the the list as a new day is also great that sort the task list everyday.;1
It's a wonderful app, good UI and super easy to use. I do wish that you were able to upload your own pictures for the list themes and that the notifications all showed up as 1 instead of individually. 👊👍🤙;1
Necessary. Needs a little more life and interaction to its graphics;1
Please allow to set the time on the due date so the tasks can also be sorted by time. Overall great performance on all my devices.;1
The Microsoft To Do List app has helped organize my daily activities and it's not so overwhelming, anymore, having a lot to do. I just add the task(s) to the app and I can come back to remind myself of what I have to do. This is definitely one of the tools in my daily arsenal.;1
"Good but it could be much better. Tick tick can serve as an example for exelent scheduling. Suggestion 1: Automatically add task to ""today"" category according to due date or reminder date Suggestion: 2. In the ""important"" and ""Today"" category add option ""sort by group name and list name. Suggestion 2: Calendar integration or calendar view";1
I love it... I was looking for something like this for a long time. I love that I can organize my list in any way I want too. I love that I can add colors, thems and mark task done without delete it. The best of all is I can share not only by text but also by email!!;1
"Great app, just as its predecessor, Wunderlist. I wish we could move subtasks to other tasks though. Also the use of the ""Add to My Day"" feature takes some time getting used to. I still haven't.";1
I love this app ...have been using it since a year & still going ahead ....but I would appreciate if we can add one more thing ....>> Can we put the Daily Calendar Timings in MY DAY tab so it becomes easier not the Put My day Tasks into my Calendar for daily scheduling. Hope we can do this ! Thanks RJ;1
It's a good little app, I just wish that the tasks reset themselves if they are set to be done daily, and are not completed. I don't know how to fix that (besides the obvious saying they were done when they were not).;1
I used Wunderlist in its prime and this looks like a smooth updated version with backing from MS. The opening page is different but it's functional as it can be. I also like that it links to my Outlook Calendar to give me that extra reminder.;1
"When deleting or ""accidentally"" deleting a task, it doesn't prompt me to confirm deletion even though I have ""Confirm deletion"" option selected in settings. Please fix. Thank you.";1
The integration with the calendar and options to enhance the entry is excessively useful. It helps to keep track of multiple issues without having to use a complex Gannt chart or spreadsheet.;1
The best To-Do App ever🤩.. Just please add custom themes options to add more backgrounds or unsplash integration so I can choose more backgrounds..;1
Great app. I am using it for my school work and personal life. What it is lacking in is colour coding for my subjects. It would really be useful and save time for writing lists and visually differentiate tasks.;1
Awesome! Use it for all task & list management. Great to use it for work & personal tasks and lists for grocery shopping as well. Love it. My kids love it as well.;1
This application is as good as wunderlist. Only thing MS login is a difficult part while using from office system. You need to keep login in office. In wunderlist this problem was not there.;1
Just got the app so rating may change. I would like to be able to add ppl to a Group and therefore all lists under the group would automatically be seen by the group. This would make things more efficient. Thank you.;1
Works as intended and I like the customisability. Only reason for 4 stars is sometimes the other user of the same list or I have some items missing. Therefore the syncing doesn't always work 100%;1
Good to do list... sometimes it has some issues of sychronisation between other applications (such as Planner). All in all I would recommend it, sspecially if you're on an Office 365 account... or a Microsoft user.;1
I really like the app, it doesn't sync as well as Wunderlist with my husband's device. He has two Microsoft accounts (one for business) and we can't figure out how to consistently use the personal MS account for To Do.;1
Almost as good as wunderlist except for a few things. Installation is not seamless. Had repeated problems of login. Secondly sorting of tasks by assignee has been removed. That was a very helpful feature.;1
After years of using Wunderlist, I was sceptical, but to my surprise and delight, it works just as well and provides what I need. I haven't tried too many of the features, as I have simple needs, but for my purposes, works well;1
Helps me get the jobs done;1
Good experience better than before;1
If I move a task higher in a list. Same task should also get higher in My day list also.. That's it.. Thumbs up to microsoft...;1
I use this and Google keep religiously for my business and personal activities;1
Really is a great tool. Needs a way to export to excel and time tracking per task.;1
Fair;1
Good Wunderlist Replacement;1
Please allow to set the time on the due date so the tasks can also be sorted by time. Overall great performance on all my devices.;1
Good;1
So far so good;1
It does organizes of my daily tasks . but I needs improvised on notification section. But overall exquisitely done.I was always waiting for app like this keep going!;1
Could have more option;1
It doesn't remind you for weekly or daily tasks if you don't tap on 'done' circle. Please fix it to remind us although we don't tap on first day's tap to make it done;1
If Google Calendar integration was available with this app, it'd be loads better. Apart from that it's great. I've been using it for a while alongside other apps like Anydo and Todoist. They have a few features that I hope Microsoft builds into this app, but on the whole, I like this the most. It's simple, you can export your lists, and you can create steps for tasks.;1
Great app. I just wish it could be more interactive such that memebers in a shared task could chat among them selves without leaving the app;1
Easy to use;1
Good synch from platform to platform;1
Easy to use;1
It's could be better if have something like labels;1
No trash bin. No back up option. If you accidently delete. Its gone;1
Almost perfect.. only two things still missing: category (one taks can be appear in multiple list) and scheduled task can be displayed/appear in calendar on the date of completion target.;1
Please give us more background pictures . Overall this app is better than any To-Do list app present in play store.;1
Helpful with sorting out my day;1
Does what it does very well. This review is with mixed feelings because, I feel the user interface of Wunderlist is better...;1
Easy to use.;1
Super helpful for tracking things.;1
I have been using this app for a week now. It is wonderful. However few suggestions, manager i should be able to see how many assigned task is given to the college;1
The best To-Do App ever🤩.. Just please add custom themes options to add more backgrounds or unsplash integration so I can choose more backgrounds..;1
Good basic list maker. There were many updates made since its inception and I look forward to what lies ahead. It is missing the ability to organize your lists and folders alphabetically. Also it's odd that when I'm moving a list, it gives me all the other lists instead of the folder. I'm sure this will be corrected soon.;1
The last few updates have the functionality going in the right direction. Well done MS keep up the good work.;1
Excellent work done by the Microsoft team, really wonderful. Just want a few upgrades, have an option to set a particular list or smart list as home-screen i.e. whenever we open the app we are directly directed to our selected list. And other is that make the app icon interesting, it is very much simple.;1
Ok;1
Foes the same job as wunderlist but functions better.;1
I don't miss Wunderlist. This app is great. The only thing it doesn't have is integration with Google Assistant. That would be great. Otherwise this is super.;1
Necessary. Needs a little more life and interaction to its graphics;1
It is much easier to organise tasks using this app.;1
"Would you please add ""confirm before swiping left to delete a task"". Sometimes I just accidentally swipped a task and I didn't notice, and the task just disappeared.. Besides, it would be wonderful if To Do is able to assign both start-date and end-date to a task. Thank you!";1
This is difficult to manage. I like my old wunderlist better;1
Very useful but let me remove ads! Or at least dont allow noisy video ads.;1
Great way to keep track of everything I have to do. I can create different groups of tasks and then select items from each of them to add to today's list and the ones I don't complete are easily seen tomorrow when creating that daily list. I just wish I could prioritize with numbers (1, 2, 3 ...) and not just stars.;1
It's handy and simple. Overall great experience;1
Gostava mais do Wunderlist.;1
Changing from wunderlist I was concerned it wouldn't be as good. I'm increasingly appreciating this app. Seems big improvements were made to it to reflect some of wunderlist best features. Thanks for the work put in to achieve this.;1
Of all the apps out there to plan tasks and meetings, i like this one the best.;1
When I enter in the task, I need to view it in full window. You're not giving this opportunity. Because of that, I cannot see it as i see in outlook: full information. The right colum is missing... Please, allow tasks view in full window.;1
It is easy. Would love to have more sort options. But I keep a lot of lists and keeps me organized.;1
I am not able to link my gmail and Yahoo emails with it. If this feature is present please have a look at the problem and if this feature is absent please add it it makes tasks more easier.;1
Will give 5 stars if less loading lag;1
Good app. They finally fixed the major issues around linking it to your Outlook account. I like the My Day functionality. Adding subtasks works great! Works on all my platforms seamlessly. Allows and remembers user sorting of tasks for those that go in an order. Very well done!;1
Best Todo list app, still had areas for improvement, but I haven't found anything that is better.;1
Decent job replacing my beloved Wunderlist. Thanks for implementing most of the useful features that I loved in Wunderlist!;1
"Great overall. Annoying that notifications can't be more fine tuned. I would like to be able to choose the type of notifications as some are very useful and others are just irritating eg ""yesterday you only complete 0 of 3 tasks""";1
Use it all the time. Its my Diary;1
Maybe I don't understand the purpose, but Starred Items still do not appear on the top of my Planned list. I reported this months ago and was informed it was being worked on but multiple upgrades have occurred and checking the option, does nothing to the position of starred items. I have swapped the switches and reinstalled app.;1
Good app, use it on laptop and mobile device. Suggest to add option to export all (incl completed) to Excel or csv.;1
Much happier since the sync was fixed 👌;1
It's a great app I absolutely use it on day to day purpose .... It has some great features and is ver useful . If you are like me who have a lot on thier plate and forgets it then it's a must try;1
I don't care;1
Hope we can change the fonts' COLOR while we pick a picture theme.;1
Very good...;1
I'm Loving the experience so far!! Just fo future updates could you guys please allow this as a default Google assistant task 🙏;1
Didn't used to be a good replacement for Wunderlist, but now it's close. Navigation and UI are great, lists are very useful and easy to organize. My only beefs are lack of control over notifications for shared lists (notification every time a list item is added, completed, etc.), and with Wunderlist you used to be able to invite people to a shared list without using a 3rd party app if they were already a user... annoying to have to text/message links when i've previously shared lists with...;1
"Great way to organize my tasks. I wish that the ""My Day"" flag would highlight or move to the next day if I didn't get to it today.";1
Big fan of to do lists.;1
I didn't use for a long time that's why I did not give it 5 stars, it is simple and practically great;1
Really helped to keep my life organized.;1
I was very close to give 5 🌟 but there must be some more background photos, or atleast feature to add our own photos. And it must contain some sound tones for the reminder but the rest is great;1
I miss Wunderlist, but once you get To do register on your devices it works smoothly. Really I like that I can edit lists offline.;1
Overall good but please bring back Smart Dates and Notification Counter;1
I just downloaded this yesterday and I am enjoying this app so far. Especially the sound after you finished a specific task. I am happy that I found this app. I will use this for work and everyday goals. Thanks! 😊;1
Simple and Elegant.;1
Good interface;1
Finally something good 👍;1
Very easy to use Not complicated;1
pretty good... asking me to rate too early. so, only 4 stars as i have evaluated only a small portion of the app.;1
Very straightforward tool...easy to use.....which makes it a strong personal organizing tool. Half the battle is using a tool to get organized, focused and productive and the simplicity of this tools ease of use makes it very powerful!;1
Good but still needs improvements. At least, it should be able to give high priority to task at the moment of creating them.;1
Very excellent, well organised!!! I suggest that more themes may come soon❤️;1
I like it very useful;1
Its great;1
It is great! It will be even greater if it was integrated with the outlook app..;1
Quality of good is working Microsoft to do : List;1
A good app, gives me the chance to save my completed tasks amongst my documents on windows for easy recall at a later date when I've got to repeat a task some time later. The negatives are: 1. on each task, any text entered on 'next step', doesn't show on the task in Microsoft Outlook. 2. There is no way of categorising your tasks, other than creating folders and switching between folders. 3. Woking with attachments on tasks using my Live mailbox is diffacult, attachments can't always be opened;1
My day - the great feature. I'm missing messages from Wunderlist :'c;1
I think it seem to fine.;1
Good;1
Very good;1
Only disadvantage is, that not everything is sortable;1
The integration with the calendar and options to enhance the entry is excessively useful. It helps to keep track of multiple issues without having to use a complex Gannt chart or spreadsheet.;1
Very good. Probably 5 stars when I learn all its tricks;1
It's so simple yet soo good. Would love it even more if it has built-in pomodoro feature.;1
Great help every day;1
Inform and remember automatically in this app good;1
The app does what it says across devices. Would love a feature to add colours to the list to sort them out as per urgency. Another feature could be to give formatting options for text for additional notes within a set task.;1
Needs some more functionality and integration with PC, but good.;1
Really helped me to organise myself. Give it a try;1
Quite user friendly.;1
It's pretty good just few features to be added for it to be even more better eg. Sharing tasks, adding sounds to the notifications popping up. Otherwise I love it;1
Almost as good as Wunderlist. The only thing I would change, and this is very minor, is that every time I open the app, it goes automatically to the last list I updated, instead of to the main list of lists. That's my only pet peeve. My husband and I share grocery lists, Home Depot lists, etc through this app now that Wunderlist is gone, and it's very useful and user-friendly.;1
This is what I wanted from long time, best app to sync with both my (Win 10) PC and smartphone. Customized lists (My Day, Planned, Imp. etc) + sorting orders both are best. Scheduling is awesome. Everything what I wanted. Notification for PC is good. (Please fix notification for android, it will be better if it notify like alarm - need user attention to snooze or off - and user can add their own notification tone also). Please don't remove any other thing. I loved the app for both PC+Android.;1
I tried this out on a whim, thinking it was just another todo app that's been done a thousand times over. So far I'm finding it really simple to create lists and track tasks, which, as a result, actually has had a great impact on my mental stress by being able to organise my tasks and ideas in one user friendly place. I'm super happy that the mobile app syncs with the desktop app so that I can add things via my phone, forget about them, and action them when I'm at my PC the next day;1
Really simple and easy to use. I thought it was gonna be a ripoff like all other to do apps but its by far the best imo. Keeps my schedule on track and makes me finish work faster. Would be great if we could change the theme photo with our own;1
I have been using this app for almost one year. this is must have app for avoid forgetting important things. One important feature I like is Widget. whenever I open my mobile it will always reminds me.;1
Great improvement from my old time favourite todo list app WUNDERLIST.... It has all the basic old tools + very improved new look.. Wow.... Thanks Microsoft... You really wisely picked the best todo list and turned it into a master pcs....... 5 starts from me.;1
Was a big fan of Wunderlist that I even used at work with my team. Was worried about a move over and possibly losing features, but I'm impressed and very happy with this new iteration.;1
I use it daily to organize exercise routines, my diet, things i don't want to forget with reminders, preparing for my wedding, daily reading, list of places I've applied to in job searching, and more.;1
Great app for organizing To Do lists. Allows task lists under each item for more detailed planning Even has a Project section for more high level planning. Very user friendly. No ads.;1
Exceptional and meticulously developed app!! Has all the necessary features and I am saying it after trying almost every good organiser app on Playstore. Kudos to the developers and Microsoft.;1
Great all around To Do App. I have tried many apps for this purpose and this is the best one by far. Nice feature sharing lists with other people.;1
It replaced Wunderlist for me and is very much like it. Transfer of data to To Do worked well. Had to get used to new but other than that works well.;1
I originally started using wunderlist in 2013. I have loved it ever since and the transition was so easy, no effort at all. I use it every day to keep track of thoughts, plans, goals, recipies, not just to dos. I recomend it to anyone who needs to write things down. Its user friendly, and this comes from a technophobe. i enjoy that i can personlise its appearance (to a certain degree). I love the lists with the ability to subdivide, and share. It really makes my life easier.;1
"I've literally only just downloaded this app, but I already loooove it. So easy to use and very helpful. You can break down tasks into smaller tasks, which is very very nice and you can easily order tasks to organise them. I like how you can add tasks from different sections into ""My day"" as I like to have a big long list of everything I need to do and then choose what I'll be doing for the day. I love the layout and its customisable with colours and emojis. Simple but efficient.";1
Very convenient app. Surprising number of features. Much better than just writing tasks on a notepad.;1
Absouloutly Amazing! I am a very list oriented person, and this app is such a great and handy app to keep everything in your life organized, from work jobs to household chores. The one thing I would improve is the design. It doesn't have a very aesthetically pleasing format. But other than that, I would not change a thing. Thank you Microsoft!;1
Finally! The supplement to the Outlook app. Integrates well with creating tasks and flagging emails. I'm finding it faster to manage tasks from my Note 10 over the normally used desktop version. I'm now able to manage from my mobile device without being strapped to my laptop. Nor do I have to wait to boot up laptop to process emails, thought, or create tasks. Thank Microsoft for increasing my production. I just started using it today and excited for future use while working from laptop.;1
I use this app for not just for to-do lists but paperless shopping lists as well. I categorise all my tasks into different buckets, then at night or in the morning, I go through each category and 'star' the most important & urgent tasks so they appear in the 'Important' list, so I know what to focus on for that day and I can ignore the rest. It's really mentally calming.;1
Unbelievably helpful. This is probably the best productivity app currently in the store. I do have a list of improvements for Microsoft but even as it is, it's an easy 5-star. It also works seamlessly across PC and mobile, across multiple users. I do wish Microsoft would enable in-app messaging and link to phonebook. That would make it unbeatable.;1
Seems to have implemented most of the best features from the Wunderlist app they acquired last year. It's easy to add tasks and move them from one heading to or rearrange them in any order. It's easy to rename tasks or revise headings. It's easy to dismiss tasks and to restore them. I'd like to be able to use my own photos in the background, or to have the full set of photos available from Wunderlist.;1
I love this app! I created lists for Amazon items I want to order, groceries I need to buy, things to do (with deadlines), a wish list, etc. I also share these lists with members of my family so I don't have to ask them to tell me what they need (or if they've used the last of an item) from the store. They just automatically add it! So helpful!;1
Very useful app for maintaining regular 'to do' lists. Adding a task is a breeze. The best thing I love most is YOU CAN ADD SUBTASKS WITHIN A TASK. Like if you want to finish a task in 4 steps, you can add each step as a subtask, and each can be marked as completed or not. You can sort the priority of a task by long pressing it and moving to the desired spot which is cool. And swiping a task towards left side deletes it, which is also cool. Super useful app for finishing your daily tasks.;1
Love this app so much!!. I deal with a lot of procrastination, and it's been two days so far that I've been consistent with my schedule using this app. Genuinely didn't think that I would be able to pull off a schedule, but this app has made it much more simpler. I'm really glad I found this app!.;1
Very efficient for if you have many tasks at one time. I have this app on 3 devices, I can check off my list on any 3 as it syncs. Love it.;1
Latest version broke completed list sort. Used to work for the longest time. Was very useful. Now not so much. Fixed now. Thanks.;1
The best way to manage your schedule with this app.. I m already in love with this application. would highly recommend to you too..;1
I absolutely love this app! It's very simple UI makes me want to open and plan my day every single day. Great job MS;1
Great tool for coordinating between family members! I love being able to share lists so everyone is on the same page.;1
The App is just awesome. Loved it. Very useful for daily planning and keeping records of day to day work. Nice app. I am using it for past one month. Those who are searching for a good app for day to day work purposes, must try it. It's completely ad free..;1
Like all the other users of Wunderlist i had no choice but to switch. It took time to figure out how to be able to create lists without having to have due dates & reminders-shut them off in settings. I already had a Microsoft account which I used to sign into Wunderlist so I used it to automatically sign into To Do. That made it easy to import the Wunderlist lists to To Do {pop up at bottom}. I panicked at first but I was able to figure out how to use To Do in about an hour after installing it;1
easy to use and organized, i hope you will add task completion time stamp so i would know when did i accomplish the task. i also add an attachment captured via camera but unfortunately when i reopened the task i cant find the attachment. This is a very useful app, if you are a secretary or someone who does a lot of things you must try this. This will make your life easier;1
I love it. I don't use many Advanced features but for a simple note-taking app that syncs with my laptop and my phone quickly this is great Before I was using Wunderlist. It shut down and I got transferred to here and it moved all of my data seamlessly. Before that was Astrid and they also moved over all of my data. Hopefully this one doesn't shut down;1
Seriously, this app is easy to use yet so useful. The workflow is smooth and user friendly, thumbs up.;1
I only really use this as a to-do list after wunderlist stopped. This app is good. You can easily share and print lists. There is a lot more to it, but for my needs it is perfect. Only downside is that you need a MS account to use it, this is so it can sync to your pc.some people might not like this, bit it doesn't bother me. Edit: now that you can group lists together, this app is great.;1
After years of using Wunderlist, I was nervous about moving over to this new app, but I should've known I had no reason to be! When it first moved over, my only complaint WAS that new tasks only went to the bottom instead of the top of the list, but they fixed it almost immediately. Any complaints you have they're quick to take care of. I love the additional features they didn't have in Wunderlist, ease of use, and how easy it is to share lists with my husband and use for work. Excellent app!;1
Easy to use, I just use the most basic functions, for almost a year I have had no glitches.;1
We used this app to update grocery items as a family & bring whenever we need. Since this sharable app this will help us to save money by bringing only required grocery items;1
This is an excellent app for keeping notes, tasks, and lists, and for collaborating with others. It's smart, sleek, intuitive, and easy to use. My favourite aspect of it is that an app icon appears in the status bar, and one click opens a small text box for adding a quick note. This is much easier and faster than Google Notes, which I have been using, and that itself is an excellent app. I fully recommend this app!;1
"Love this app. Very useful for capturing all my to-do items. I like that you can share lists with others working on the same projects. They get notifications for completed tasks and can assign you tasks as well. Helpful to avoid micromanaging from others or yourself. I wish that there was an easy way to move tasks to the next day from ""My Day"" if not complete. Also, reminders are not set automatically for recurring tasks.";1
"A To-do app well worth a five star rating. There was some issue with shared folders at first, but that seems to have been resolved. The only thing I would request is a way to monitor ""failed"" tasks. I would like to keep track of my habits, but it's not a habit tracker, so I don't begrudge it for that. Also, Google Calendar integration would be nice, but I also understand why that isn't available. Response to developer: ""Second try"", I haven't stopped using it. The app is excellent.";1
I still need a sound reminder Your sound reminder is still functionless. It only works when the app is running, I don't see any importance. The reminder, if am supposed to guess,ought to work when I'm doing other things for it to remind me. I mean, it should behave like an alarm. Kindly check on that because as of now am wasting a lot of time, or maybe I should find another app;1
For someone with ADHD who forgets things constantly (minute by minute), having an app that syncs across any device I want (PC, phone, work computer, etc) is a huge benefit. Think of some random thing I want to do? Add it on the phone, and then I can see it when I go to my PC next. It's a pretty darn good free app. It syncs with Outlook, too, for those of us who use it for work or whatever.;1
"I was a user of Wunderlist but then MS bought them out and transitioned to TODO. It's about the same, at least for the features I use/used. I like that my wife and I can share lists and assign tasks through it. I haven't checked to see if it offers location features - that was a feature I liked from the similar ""G"" based offering.";1
Really sad that Wunderlist is now gone because I've used that for YEEAAARRSSS, but thankfully this new Microsoft To Do is nearly the same. My only complaint is that it's hard to copy numbers because it instantly auto opens to dial. Other than that, this is still the best list app for me.;1
This is amazing! Exactly what I've been looking for. Funny I didn't think about a Microsoft app while searching for a to-do list app, they have everything you need. ESPECIALLY WHEN LOOKING TO ALWAYS BE UP-TO-DATE with your files on all of your devices. Thank you!;1
This is a terrific App - one of my Favourites. It would be so great if it was also on the Amazon Appstore too, for the Kindle Fire Tablets. Do you have any plans to launch this on that format?;1
It's great! I have discovered that this app has almost everything I need. Alarms for med's, for appointments. Schedule tasks once or daily. I try not to schedule too many daily tasks though, because once the daily tasks are complete and on repeat, the tasks get sent to the bottom of the app when completed. Every single task daily must be deleted individually by swiping to the left. It would be really nice if we could delete the completed tasks all at once. The gmail sync would be great!;1
"Perfect for my needs, after trying more than 10 other tasks apps. Simple and straightforward, I currently have 13 lists, like ""Home Store"" to capture what I need to buy there, plus use ""Tasks"" as a catch-all for more immediate to-dos. Love it.";1
Works very well. Easy set up More importantly sync seamlessly to all device. And it is free as well;1
Really nice. Has all the features you could want in this kind of app. UI is beautiful. While I'll miss Wunderlist, this app is a worthy successor, and I don't think they could have made it any easier to switch over. Hopefully Google Assistant support is added at some point, but given this is a Microsoft app, I have a feeling it's entirely up to Google whether or not they want to play nice. Please Google, please.;1
This has turned out to be a pretty great app! I love the My Day feature. Wishlist: 1. overdue items shown on the Today list, 2. in Wunderlist I could highlight an item when the keyboard was up, but here I have to close the keyboard first, then highlight (that extra step is a distraction and a little annoying), 3. ability to hide Flagged Email list when empty, like you can with the other Smart lists. Otherwise, perfect. Thanks!;1
Great App to maintain all category task, you can categorise it to personal, work and many more and it can sync to all device where you have logged in using same account. It replaced my physical book to maintain to do list. And it is available to me on the go as well.;1
It is a good basic list app which is all I wanted. Really like the sharing aspect.;1
I transferred from Wunderlist. I enjoy many features, especially being able to share it all with another person. They have fixed some of the comments I've seen like you can tell it to put a new item at the top of the list. Only problem I've seen is when I move a weekly item to a different day, it keeps the reminder on the day it was originally on.;1
I moved over from Wunderlist, which was a very straightforward process - everything was imported into the new app quickly and easily. I was a bit worried about how the new app would work because I'd been using Wunderlist for quite a while, but I actually prefer Microsoft To Do - there are just small things which are more intuitive. It's a very straightforward app which does what it says on the tin;1
I would like to Thank you Microsoft for creating this app, really useful app user friendly, looks clean, options are so cool, if they have add options of changing background to users wallpaper that would be really great 🥰 Awesome guys Thank you;1
I originally left to two-star review after switching from Wunderlist. I was really annoyed that I was forced to switch apps, but after a few months of using this I've realized it is far better than Wunderlist in almost every way (except for the brief pause to load lists that Wunderlist never had). It's loaded with every available feature you could possibly want and I'm very pleased with it overall. Thanks for a great free list tool.;1
Extremely helpful app from Microsoft's garage. This is my go to app for scheduling tasks, managing grocery list collaboratively. It's extremely helpful because I get access to my list of tasks from my computer too. And the best part of all, it's totally free. I give 5 stars here, highly recommended 👍🏼;1
I'm addicted to this app. Makes managing tasks much more manageable than any other app I have tried and is the only one that has made going paperless with my lists comfortable. Lots of features provide flexibility to let you choose how to prioritise tasks. I love the 'My day' feature that let's you focus on what you want or need to get done today.;1
I love the ability to have multiple lists going at once. Also being able to share the same list with multiple people makes grocery shopping so much easier with 5 of us in the house. Keeping track if what you have crossed off makes making your list for next time that much easier and quicker.;1
I was scared when Wunderlist sold but honestly, it's even better now. It's complex enough to be valuable yet is still user friendly. I really haven't tried anything that has come close. Well done - whoever made this!;1
Best to do app available! Unlimited lists you can share with friends and family members.;1
Edit: Fixed with a recent update. Thank you for the fast solution! Unfortunately, a recent update has disabled one of the most important use cases for me: The ability to see all tasks relevant to today at once, which are not just the today todos, but also those overdue, otherwise those tasks are just getting more and more late if you forget to check the other filter. Just make the filter optional again please.;1
This is the best list app for single user and multiple users. Share with partner and family, save time and sanity. What To Do Today? With a little planning the To Do List will help you stay on track with your projects, remember what parts and pieces you need when you need them. Previously called The Wunderlist, Microsoft has actually improved it. Wow! Never thought I would say that.;1
Very useful. Sharing my shopping list has been so helpful while I have been sheltering during the epidemic. Bringing completed items back to the active list saves having to rewrite them. Good to be able to move items up and down to-do lists to put them in order of priority.;1
The one that I really needed. Tried too many Todo apps with Big O ( n to the power n ) complexity and on top of that you have to pay after certain time or step. This is constant time complexity and doesn't ask for any money. Now don't rant about my data. My to-dos are not very personal.;1
Quality, very helpful, when busy, helps track tasks and keeps dates passed as well.;1
It's a great app. I'm happy that it continually receives updates and improvements. It fills a gap that MS really needed. it's nice to be able to have it show in Outlook too. I'm looking forward to the many more improvements on the way!;1
I love this app. I use it weekly if not daily. Some of my lists are shared with my husband like Groceries and House Projects. Its so nice to add things to my grocery list when i think of them and not try to recall everything i need when i'm planning to go. I previously used Wunderlist so i've been using this type of app for years and would and have recommended it;1
"Great way to keep your tasks organised. Allows tasks to be grouped by project and also you can select tasks Todo today via you ""My Day"". Clean user interface and available on multiple platforms including website. If all that wasn't enough, it's Free. Not the type of free where you can upgrade to use without ads. No. Its fully free. No adds. No add-ons. Finally Microsoft done something right.";1
Very good. I used to have Google Keep and this app has better capabilities as each item on the list can have a (1) due date & (2) reminder date. On Google Keep only the list can have reminder date. 1 capability that would be useful for to-do is reminders based on location (this app doesn't have it but Google Keep does);1
Great task manager. Easy to organize work and personal task lists.;1
One if the best apps I have seen for making lists. Really happy you changed the alphabetical listing to include the completed list also. Makes it so much easier to add items back onto the list. I don't usually give 5 star ratings ( because I feel there is always something to improve on) but did BECAUSE of the alphabetical listing! 😊;1
"If you don't want to pay Todoist for basic features like reminders and comments, use Microsoft To Do. I don't understand all the hate - this is as good as Wunderlist, at least for my personal usage. Having said that, the home screen UI is a bit bland and ""dry"". Maybe a fresh touch is due. Also, I would love new features, such as Archive list (instead of only deleting) and the ability to add Section (to divide tasks into sections, just like Todoist). And a few more theme colors would be nice.";1
Great app and easy to use. All my lists in one place. Love it;1
May 22, 2020 - updating to 5 stars, this app is my go-to. Easy to use, pleasing UI, and sharing is easy. Also, thanks for listening and responding! Was a 5, dropping to 3 after last update. Separating completed items would be fine (though less tidy visually than hiding), but sort orders now don't apply to completed items. Grocery lists become much more tedious, as you have to now either search through an unsorted list or type every grocery list item again from memory.;1
Easy to use. I use it for grocery lists, keeping up with chores and running errands. I store my favorite recipes, so I can check ingredients when I'm at the store. The uses are endless. And now I dont worry about forgetting anything, I just check my list, because it auto updates across all my devices.;1
Indispensable for an organized one. It has come a long way since it was first offered to Microsoft Office Users. The good thing is the New intutive features are being suggesting the developer team behind this app is perhaps thinking ahead of users with regards to sort of add-on and integrating the same to make it further useful and far more easier and thus making it the 1st Choice for To Do task users .Great!;1
They restored one of the best features, the completed items now match the order select of the not completed. This makes the app ideal for families to keep shopping list etc. Being able to mark items as needed again is just what a lot of shared lists need. Now that the completed items are sorted, I highly recommend this app for families.;1
Smooth transition from Wunderlist. Most of the features are the same, but I do find ToDo more easily integrated into my daily use. I can add and edit tasks from the widget (wunderlist only allowed my to view, and would open the app if I wanted to check off a task). I find the My Day feature, and the option to add tasks from items scheduled for that day or previous days a cleaner, more uncluttered user experience.;1
"I use this app every day. Where I used to have paper lists and sticky notes everywhere, I now have all of my ""to do"" lists and reminders in one place - My phone! Helps me to get/stay organized. I can also share lists with my husband through the app. I absolutely love it and wouldn't want to do without it!";1
I use this list for EVERYTHING!!! Dr. Apt- with notes of what to bring with me Shopping lists..meal ideas with notes of needed ingredients Reminders- and associated information Dates, times, notes, addresses, phone numbers- this list has helped organize everything for me Definitely my go to daily!!!;1
I absolutely love this app for all my lists! I use it for shopping, birthday & Christmas requests. I have several nieces & nephews so I keep a list for each one on their current sizes for clothing. That helps Auntie out alot when I'm shopping.;1
Best app ever! You can even change the design theme for the lists there are pictures and colours to choose for the background! However, I think you should make a function for fonts so that we can choose our own fonts. Overall, its a really great app!;1
Love creating all kinds of lists for different reasons and being able to share with others. It has been wonderful having a grocery list created for my parents we share because I've been doing their shopping during Covid19. Also love the different background photos to choose from!!;1
Good balance of task options and simplicity has made this my go-to to-do app at the moment. You can see Microsoft's Outlook experience shining through with the options that are available on the tasks but you can also see that they've thought about the user experience rather than just making Outlook tasks look better. The list groups and My Day allow enough organisation without over-complicating it. Nice job Microsoft.;1
can't complaint, simple and easy to use especially with my-day feature, this app offers the best features for a free to-do-it app. highly recommended for those who want a simple & free to do it app that does it jobs. I tried todoist premium before, a lot of its features I don't need and it's quite complicated for me - I'm using this app nown and not using todoist (even i have paid premium for it);1
sharing the shopping list or any other too lost with my wife made our lives easier... before that it was v hard and frustrating to do shopping for the hause since we both work and on our way home we didn't know who got what. with this app with real time update and sharing option, it solved the problem.;1
Used it for the past one month. No issues so far. Love how you can share the list with someone else and easy to rank the items in the list. Recommended for those who want to increase their daily productivity..;1
So user friendly and syncs very well across multiple devices! Love it!;1
Thia app has been a lifesaver. I have been able to organize all of my professional and personal tasks and am doing a better job of staying on top of things. I can write them down, schedule them and let them go until I am ready to handle them. A great new way of getting things done!;1
I use Tasks in Outlook for work. This To Do synchs up perfectly. If you have a task with a lot of notes and files, I wouldn't reccomend opening up in To Do. It has lost items when I've done so in the past. But this is perfect to use while out of the office and to keep your day rolling.;1
To be honest this app keep you dedicated all the time. You are encouraged to do the work. All above you got lot other features in it. You can even put up the timing. It is the app with a lot of other features that a 'to do list' app should have. It being great time with you Microsoft To Do :);1
It is one of the best apps of microsoft with features like easy sharing of my tasks as a text message or pdf file, creating different groups for different tasks, sorting of tasks according to their importance and many more.;1
It's a really nifty app, with a lot more convenient features than wunderlist, and a lot more options for diff types of tasks. A very efficient way to stay organized and get things done.;1
Started with Wunderlist years ago. This works just as well. The ability to share a list with my husband means we both always know what groceries are needed and there's no list to be forgotten at home!;1
Spot on ! No frills, no compromises. This solves my QUEST for a to-do app, which has been going on for more than a year. This one is on point with being utilitarian and decluttered. I'm already recommending to everyone I know.;1
Fantastic usability. Security realized and feature-rich. Beyond comparison. I just hope that they re-arrange the Notes section by putting the scheduling buttons below and the Notes above for easy access and viewing. Thanks.;1
love it never forget to buy if it on the list;1
Good and user friendly;1
We can increase our productivity surely by utilizing this app✌😍;1
Good;1
I don't think that hazel-E abuse beaten pouring bleach blowtorch into lakeisha;1
Very good app for work organizations and reminder for our day to activities;1
Its a bit hard to use at first but if you adjust yourself , you'll get the hang of it;1
Superb;1
Convenient for taking my purchases;1
Excellent organizational capacities. Love the reminder if yesterdays tasks. The daily separation form the dump of all tasks which can be organized into other spots later;1
I like this app.;1
Exactly what I needed. A tool to remind me what to do. That's it 👌🙏❤️;1
Love it;1
Ausome app If it include project option like we see in todoist it will be great;1
Enjoying it;1
I can access it using any device on which it is installed, I get reminders, it works for me !!;1
It is good. I like this app;1
Perfect! Great for organising all my lists. Love it.;1
Extrem de utila. Recomand;1
Very good planning app;1
Simple and easy to manage. Sync with other devices.;1
Wonderful for daily life style;1
very well;1
Love the app... Great way to keep your tasks in order. Love how you can sync it with your desktop version via email.;1
It's a brilliant, well thought-out, superbly designed, flawless app. Adore using it.;1
Helpfully to manage task and sharw with team;1
Love this!;1
Simply fantastic and user friendly.;1
"I work alone and I've used Trello for a couple of years now. Three days ago I moved to Microsoft To-Do and am enjoying a more natural experience working through my day. Trello was awesome but in the end it was distracting, too much ""noise"" for me. I like the more peaceful My Day focus of Microsoft To-Do and the forced review to plan the new day works really well. Congratulations Microsoft team, well done.";1
I can organize everything through this one app. I love it. No complaints so far.;1
Yeasty 6PM is okay but not much better 3rd century French toast;1
Very good;1
Good. Use is simple and very intuitive.;1
Simple and effective;1
La mejor app para organizar;1
I love it its so mofeda;1

Wonderful. Ties in wuth Outlook Calendar.;1
Great for shared tasks.;1
Great for shopping;1
Go forward and conquer google keep;1
very useful for every purpose;1
Excellent app!!!;1
I would like to Thank you Microsoft for creating this app, really useful app user friendly, looks clean, options are so cool, if they have add options of changing background to users wallpaper that would be really great 🥰 Awesome guys Thank you;1
Simply amazing....just try it.;1
Works great!;1
Stable.Works on Android ,PC and Apple devices;1
Too useful and organized;1
Good .. helpfully app;1
So easy to use I love it;1
Like it;1
Useful as all can add even when one person is at the shops it comes through with updates;1
Perfect Wished there was some analysis tho and maybe some design changes;1
Very helpful to take life in your hand;1
Best task management app ever. Would love if it notes taking capabilities are also added.;1
Very good;1
Great all around To Do App. I have tried many apps for this purpose and this is the best one by far. Nice feature sharing lists with other people.;1
So Far So good The app is doing what it should be doing So no complains so far;1
So user friendly and syncs very well across multiple devices! Love it!;1
Simple and usefull;1
I really like this app, I highly recommend it , so simple and useful.;1
I love it.;1
I like how i can assign categories to a date and time or can assign a new task today out of the blue to that date and time or to TODAY. I can move a task from one category to another, very flexable.;1
Simple, intuitive, efficient;1
Love it! So clean;1
Seriously, this app is easy to use yet so useful. The workflow is smooth and user friendly, thumbs up.;1
Great application;1
Great way to keep many balls in the air organized;1
Beats my expectation everyday;1
Was a big fan of Wunderlist that I even used at work with my team. Was worried about a move over and possibly losing features, but I'm impressed and very happy with this new iteration.;1
It helps me to plan my activity. Very recommended;1
Perfecto;1
Does everything I want. I've tried others, but this is the only one that does it all.;1
Quality, very helpful, when busy, helps track tasks and keeps dates passed as well.;1
Awesome;1
Good;1
Great Interface 👍 👌;1
Brilliant app. Better than Tasks;1
Really simple and easy to use. I thought it was gonna be a ripoff like all other to do apps but its by far the best imo. Keeps my schedule on track and makes me finish work faster. Would be great if we could change the theme photo with our own;1
It helps a lot for me to keep track of my work;1
Perfect application 👌;1
Syncs very well with Outlook 2010 and very easy to use;1
Very user friendly. Highly to keep your schedule organized;1
A really nice application for arranging your day it's really nice and have a nice user friendly interface ❤️lots of love to Microsoft;1
Good;1
Excellent!;1
Great tool for coordinating between family members! I love being able to share lists so everyone is on the same page.;1
This is an usefull app. Excellent.;1
Just as good as my old wunderlist app;1
This is what I wanted from long time, best app to sync with both my (Win 10) PC and smartphone. Customized lists (My Day, Planned, Imp. etc) + sorting orders both are best. Scheduling is awesome. Everything what I wanted. Notification for PC is good. (Please fix notification for android, it will be better if it notify like alarm - need user attention to snooze or off - and user can add their own notification tone also). Please don't remove any other thing. I loved the app for both PC+Android.;1
Excellent;1
Excellent app it's helped me so much;1
Organise your day.;1
Great for staying organized! Recommended to my clients often.;1
Seems like a good idea, but doesn't actually do anything but waste more time. Completely useless. Can't find calendar events. Each event has to be re-entered manually. Why would anyone want an app that is just MORE WORK? STUPID! HUGE waste of time!;0
Was good. But no longer updating real time...;0
Previously good, currently bad. This app takes you straight to Google calendarfor creating an event but once the event has been set, it's on calendar only. It doesn't even show that any event has been set on the app itself. I was using this app as sort of a time table but if I'm not able to see my plans for the day, then what's the use. Pls fix it;0
Need to about to change the Events colors thank you, other setting has the color plate to select, why is the Events that controlling the whloe widget background but only having 16 colors? And it doesn't shows the color that I chosen... they are not the same color, the magenta shows up light purple... not matching with my phone setting... and my widgets, and I hope there has a setting that can one click and the whole app color hue would be the color I like or choose, I don't like blue.;0
Why is it being linked with my google calendar or phone calendar? I don't want this private app to access my Google calenders and phone calender. Instead you should have just added the feature of adding tasks within the app. I'm deleting this. The UI is great. But I don't want you to link with my private apps.;0
Not what I thought it was... This only blocks out time for your calendars. I was looking for something that would help with daily routines. 😕. I even tried to use the calendar before giving up... But it refused to sync. So it's useless;0
How to delete all the events on my calendar that syncs from this app? So confusing;0
This is a waste app. After few days it started to shiw nothing and it says it takes time to sync with the calender but still after 24 hrs they dont sync. Please dont install this app and then expect to be productive.;0
dependant on another calendar app. Why? why do I need to have another app to use this app? I can't add plans or schedule without this app throwing the task to Google Calendar. Besides, I don't use G.C anymore since I once missed an event which I put a reminder through the G.C app because it never reminded me. I read one comment for this app that it never gave a reminder for a scheduled task and yes I have an idea why it happened.;0
I'm sure this would be a great app... if you could actually use it. But it only allows you do add things from another calendar making it useless if you don't have one.;0
Doesnt work on ALL android Wear OS devices. Specifically, doesnt work with the Watch Active2.;0
I unistalled just for the costumer service. I was ready and willing to give the app a shot. But given the cruel, uncaring, and sarcastic responses to others who were unpleased with how the app works I will be uninstalling imediately.;0
Too complicated. It probably has a lot of, but it's not intuitive enough.;0
Is there a way to add events directly . I don't want to sync it with calendar.It is very time consuming.;0
Puts all info in default Google calendar.;0
There should be add different time schedule in app not be in mobile colander;0
Does not detect my device's calendar (device default app) but instead asks me to download a calendar.;0
Uninstalled...Not at all what I thought it was. This entire app is basically just a fancy way to look at the calendars you already have. Everything syncs both ways, so if you add your actually daily schedule minute by minute to this app you are also cluttering up your calendar(s) with the same things. Would've been neat if it actually had some kind of function, but I don't need to waste sd card space on a calendar viewing app.;0
Couldn't figure out why there was a gray line in addition to the red line showing the hour. Also all day events show as a small sector instead of the entire circle. Looking at a regular calendar is still easier.;0
I wanted to like it, iinitially it looked great but it has such a limited window of time view it's no good for planning. A few hours view and that's it. Scrolling hour by hour day by day? Useless. Its sole function appears to be to tell you what you've got coming up in the next few hours which frankly is not much use to anyone as far as I can see. Cloud Cal uses similar circles with a view of the whole month which would be great but sadly the pro version doesn't work so no go there either.;0
How it SHOULD work is fantastic and perfect for me. But whenever I have my schedule laid out and planned, the app deletes them or forgets them and i have to start over, only to have them deleted again. I really really want to use it. Why does it make it so unable to?;0
The settings don't work well and it's really confusing when it doesn't function at all!!!! 😤;0
The idea is great, however it adds only event to my calendar. I like circle planer idea and that I simply can put work and then event at work and that it reflects on this circle. This has potential but make it simple and functional. I was used to test some apps and for me this was not functional and easy going. Make it that 7 years old kid can use it.;0
I don't know why this app is hard to understand . I have seen many positive comments and that's why i installed it but this is complicated or may be I want something else which this app doesn't offer.;0
Love this app. Got the pro version. It will save a lot of my cognitive work! Please fix this bug: The colour of events are set to blue when the event is created using the default colour of the (sub) calendar. Overall the app needs better UX design w.r.t the complex menu for customization and some other things e.g it was hard to figure out how to get separate widget for different calendars. But in terms of functionality it is awesome!;0
What appealed to me the most about this app was the promise that we get to see the clock on your home screen. However the settings doesn't offer that option... Now it's just another app callendar you have to tap to see what's coming up... I liked the idea I could just turn on my phone and bang! the clock would just simply show me my schedule... Idk if it's a bug or just a false promise, either way it's disappointing.;0
Sounds like a wonderful idea for time management, but it won't show half of the things on my calendar and kind of ruins the entire purpose.;0
I wanted to like this app. It's a very convenient way to see all the info I need right on the screen, but when I click on the task button I get trapped on the task screen with no way back. I have to kill the app to restart it in the clock visualization mode.;0
Edit: Still doesn't work. I suggest adding proper integration with Outlook because it is leaps and bounds ahead of Google in terms of usability and ease. - Before Edit: Doesn't show me the events already listed on my Outlook calendar. Every day is blank. When I go to add an event with only Outlook calendar selected it wants me to add an event into another calendar. I don't care about adding events (I can do it on another platform) but if can't even see my Outlook events then this is useless. Gave it all necessary permissions and checked dates and synced.;0
Does not integrate month calendar view and 24hrs view within the circular widget graphics: it only shows 24hrs (12hrs in free version). Very restrictive: the widget shows full info for one day, and no info ahead, unless you select a different day. For the days ahead you need to leave the widget, and work in a different environment. Why complicate your life? Find a calendar app you like, stay with it, come back to Sectograph when (and if) the widget fully implements time and task management.;0
cool visual but doesn't work the way I thought it would. I don't like organizing my hour-by-hour tasks through my calendar because it clutters it up and makes me miss my important events. I wanted to use this app thinking that it would allow me to plan my dialy tasks just through the app. But every time I want to plan an event it forces me to do it through my calendar which I don't like. good concept, but I don't see a reason to use it since it just wants me to use my calendar anyway.;0
Poor settings options. I tried to set a schedule for an entire day to be more productive. Kept getting emails for each task at the time I scheduled it. I also got notification pop-ups on my MacBook calendar app which seemed to sync itself with my Google calendar. I went to Google calendar to turn it off but it wouldn't let me. I had to delete all 10 emails, hide the notifications and now I will be uninstall this app. It should have an option to disable syncing. Nice idea. Lazy developers.;0
Great Concept but executed poorly. I added 2 events between 6.30am and 9.30 but when I tried adding one for 10.30am it would let me, saying it overlapped with another event which it did not. I even checked my calendar and nothing was there for that time. It's now 11.42am, I tried adding an event for 3.30pm and it said its saved but hasn't showed on the clock or anything so it's pretty useless at this point.;0
I like this app. It's just that whenever I enter something in my calendar, it would not sink right away.;0
It's pure discriminating to have to BUY an extension to be able to use 24-hour mode! Either make it free or let EVERYONE pay for the app! I would love to try this app because it really looks like it has a really nice concept, but since the devs choose to make just SOME people pay for it, then I'll gladly give it a bad review instead..;0
I don't know why I can't seem to be able to adjust the hours correctly. when I updated the time to wake up at 7.30 am but the app keep displaying I'm to wake up at 6.30am...what's wrong? wasted my time keep trying to update it. This is good effort for developer to create this app but can pls fix all the issue...may seem minor but to me it's confusing and thus rendering it less useful. tq.;0
it shows you all the features, very helpful and everything and as a final blow... it will tell you that 24 hour widget is only available via in app purchase. This is very very misleading for someone who have given their time, signed in with google, synced their events etc. frustrated.;0
This program does not work, PERIOD! Installed. Opened. Just sits there at the start screen, frozen and does nothing. No available controls or menu. Nothing. Do not use it. There is nothing to use.;0
It has a lot of functionality bugs. Some of my events were not adding, after restaring the app, other events just disappeared etc. I m really sorry i had to delete it because it looked nice and could be very useful but it s not working. Thanks!;0
Used to love it, but the latest version broke it. Couldn't get it to work. All widget face buttons would work for a few seconds then break. Tried all settings, didn't work. Fix it and I'll reconsider my rating.;0
Worked fab until recently then I noticed the time in the centre was an hour wrong although when I went into the app it had the time right. So I uninstalled and tried to reinstall but when I tried to put the widget on my home screen it now puts on a blank box that's resizable but invisible otherwise! Very disappointed.;0
Dude. Don't we all want people to pay us for everything we come up with. XXXXXXX Hi! Thanks for the attentive reply. Though this app was not worth the payment or storage space for me, I did find one that works nicely. Looking forward to more replies, hopefully relevant, or none at all.;0
Not sure how this app received such high ratings. It is just making you add events in your Google calendar to create a pie. I don't want to add daily tasks to my Google calendar. I thought this app was going to be more efficient, but it's not.;0
So it's just a demo to see if you would like to purchase the app. It says it does this so you can learn how to use the app. BUT it doesn't allow you to do anything because none of my info or calenders can be added to it because it's just a demo. So it's really hard to tell if I like something if I can't do anything on it. Something to think about if you actually want to make money selling an app. Just saying. Thanks for wasting my time while I'm trying to save time.;0
Most of My Google calendar events doesn't appear in the sectograph app. If i try to delete some events which is appeared, it cannot remove in the app also. I prefer if the app has own calendar so that events that ill creat might able show easier.;0
Not so good at all. How to enter stuff and completely useless. Very bad 👎 😕;0
I wasted my time and money because it doesn't sync to my watch. I spent hours trying to get it to work. I emailed the developer a few times but it took a few emails before he realized that his program doesn't sync to the gears s3.;0
Cannot use without existing calendar;0
It's not working unfortunately. At first it was reflecting then when I added more items, it's no longer working. It just keeps adding the data in the calendar but no graph is being created;0
Dear Developer, I have paid the amount for Pro version. After deduction still app is not get updated to Pro version. I have mail you the same issue & asked you to look into. Expecting immediate responce from you.;0
installed, looked like what I was looking for, loved the design. but the app makes me use the standard alarms and calander of my phone to put every bit of planning in, and I HATE the calendar on my phone, thats why I came here... to bad;0
It gives the option to add a local calendar but doesn't let you use it unless you also give permission to use a Google or Outlook calendar. Kind of defeats the purpose of doing a local-only calendar if I can't actually use it.;0
Purchased the full version which did nothing. Opted for a 24 hour face, again nothing. Tried to add additional events in upcoming days, did not show up at all.;0
Good on paper, tried it out and off the bat wouldn't sync any news items, wish it had an option to at least input items directly. Either way didnt work;0
Worked for 2 days. Now I can't enter anything. I enter date time description hit save it says saved but nothing shows up on the lo k dial thingy. too bad nice. oncept. tho;0
Bought the Paid version. The app fails to get data from anything except Gmail. Good concept but lacks in across provider connectivity.;0
If you love complex chronographs and a tiny slice of color tells you all, then this app is for you. This is NOT a user friendly interface . Does not play well with 9.0 pie (but not much does).;0
I just bought pro on my tablet 15 minutes ago and then installed Sectograph on my phone and it says I have to buy pro again. What the heck happened with syncing google accounts;0
It's a good app but there should be downloadble templates since it would take time and a lot harder to create your own design.;0
The wigit doesn't come with the free version. It does the same thing your Google Calendar can do. I was looking for something for time blocking ... this is time flopping;0
Very nice app. Could be very useful, but unfortunately does not sync. :(;0
After installing the app, i check to see if my reacurring event would show up. And it did that one time. So minutes after i insalled i had to let it go.;0
Looks good but it doesn't sync with events from existing calendars. It only syncs the holiday calendar but not my personal calendar.;0
"No longer work in Android 9. It can""t load meetings from Outlook or even from Google accounts. Interface is badly designed too.";0
Only certain Google calendar entries show in the sectograph making this absolutely pointless. A great idea that is flawed in execution.;0
Would love this to work. It says it is working (ticks against my Google calendars). Shows a few. Doesn't show most. Disappointing.;0
There is an issue in syncing and the events are lost in few mins post adding it. The app could have had their own calendar without syncing to android calendar. Please improvise;0
Nothing work, I have my calendar prepared for months, and nothing come inside the Sectograph, Even I added new one, nothing appeared;0
the planner does not work well. when I set it as every Monday, it shows different days.;0
I dont get it in google callender i set a goal to run 4:30 every morning but why on earth is it so that the app sets time on its own and when i edit it it is edited only for one day not the others;0
Inaccurate - always says activity overlaps with another activity when it doesn't.;0
Did not work on my Amazon Fire 8. app just flashed abou a mile a minute and nothing could be selected.;0
rly love the design, but way too scattered. (for me);0
Won't show events I add to it. Makes different events random flags or sectors for no particular reason. Really annoying.;0
Uninstalled in 5 minutes. It didn't populate anything that I had on my calender. I even tried to manually put in events and it wouldn't show on widget;0
include monthly to do list. which helps students to create timetable.;0
One feature add your app reminder with music tone;0
Cant access calendar. Allow access to calendar? Crashes. Waiti or Close app.;0
hard to use. if we could make some changes just by sliding the clock or smthn that would be awesome;0
Hard to control make this app easy to control. It's eating my head.;0
does not work properly , does not update wit hcalendar entries , worst thing , cannot aak my money back!!!!!!!;0
the whole app is based on the system calendar app..when adding, showing... tasks..use APIs but personnalize the design..;0
Not a stand alone app. Must use calendar on mobile, my pout was to use it on its own.;0
No Outlook Calendar support. Most business people use Outlook...;0
Uninstalled as calendar events keep appearing under the wrong date. Disappointing.;0
Unable to see the widget on Huawei Honor Play... After adding the widget to my Microsoft launcher... It does not appear...;0
Deleted app due to not putting things in I was looking forward to using this app I am getting the same issues as sharlyn;0
Needs to access data on device, events can't be entered manually;0
Should have an option to add reminders. it only displays events;0
it only lets you use it linked with Google calendar. You can't have 2 separate things.;0
This App is good but the setting is not understandable ... i might not even give it a single star;0
Not sync with Google Calendar;0
i almost tried this. when it opened google calendar so i could create a new event im writing this then uninstalling.;0
paid for the pro version but can't keep the changes I make to the settings.;0
Doesn't Sync Anymore! & I Paid For The Pro Version... 😤;0
foolish app. steals data. doesn't have anything of itself. takes everything from Google calendar;0
cool idea, but it forces you to use Google calendar;0
The most complicated routine managing app ever, stay away from this one.;0
How to delete all the events on my calendar that syncs from this app? So confusing;0
Was good. But no longer updating real time...;0
Not so good at all. How to enter stuff and completely useless. Very bad 👎 😕;0
I can't copy past the activities for other days i must write them on every day on the calendar;0
Seems like a good idea, but doesn't actually do anything but waste more time. Completely useless. Can't find calendar events. Each event has to be re-entered manually. Why would anyone want an app that is just MORE WORK? STUPID! HUGE waste of time!;0
Widget doesn't work;0
One feature add your app reminder with music tone;0
Sounds like a wonderful idea for time management, but it won't show half of the things on my calendar and kind of ruins the entire purpose.;0
Couldn't figure out why there was a gray line in addition to the red line showing the hour. Also all day events show as a small sector instead of the entire circle. Looking at a regular calendar is still easier.;0
someone created a time productivity app that takes too much time out of your day to understand it.;0
Scam!! Got my google Calendar scammed!! Please don't install;0
helps me somehow;0
Why is it being linked with my google calendar or phone calendar? I don't want this private app to access my Google calenders and phone calender. Instead you should have just added the feature of adding tasks within the app. I'm deleting this. The UI is great. But I don't want you to link with my private apps.;0
It cannot work by itself and it's not user-friendly;0
Are there any plans to develop a corresponding watchface in the Samsung app store for Samsung watch devices?;0
Does not pick up the calender events despite setting them;0
Does not detect my device's calendar (device default app) but instead asks me to download a calendar.;0
Need to about to change the Events colors thank you, other setting has the color plate to select, why is the Events that controlling the whloe widget background but only having 16 colors? And it doesn't shows the color that I chosen... they are not the same color, the magenta shows up light purple... not matching with my phone setting... and my widgets, and I hope there has a setting that can one click and the whole app color hue would be the color I like or choose, I don't like blue.;0
Previously good, currently bad. This app takes you straight to Google calendarfor creating an event but once the event has been set, it's on calendar only. It doesn't even show that any event has been set on the app itself. I was using this app as sort of a time table but if I'm not able to see my plans for the day, then what's the use. Pls fix it;0
Bad;0
I bought tgis application once in my infinex and when i turn to my samsong i download it and he said buy it once and for ever ... What is going on people;0
I don't know why this app is hard to understand . I have seen many positive comments and that's why i installed it but this is complicated or may be I want something else which this app doesn't offer.;0
Hard to control make this app easy to control. It's eating my head.;0
I don't really liked it much . Waste of intenet.;0
Not working;0
I unistalled just for the costumer service. I was ready and willing to give the app a shot. But given the cruel, uncaring, and sarcastic responses to others who were unpleased with how the app works I will be uninstalling imediately.;0
google calander doesnt synchronise.;0
This is a waste app. After few days it started to shiw nothing and it says it takes time to sync with the calender but still after 24 hrs they dont sync. Please dont install this app and then expect to be productive.;0
Is there a way to add events directly . I don't want to sync it with calendar.It is very time consuming.;0
Doesn't sync with calendar.;0
The settings don't work well and it's really confusing when it doesn't function at all!!!! 😤;0
Very complex....;0
rly love the design, but way too scattered. (for me);0
Might be a good app but complicated to use;0
Not the best. Did nor enjoy.;0
include monthly to do list. which helps students to create timetable.;0
I'm sure this would be a great app... if you could actually use it. But it only allows you do add things from another calendar making it useless if you don't have one.;0
Cannot use without existing calendar;0
Not what I thought it was... This only blocks out time for your calendars. I was looking for something that would help with daily routines. 😕. I even tried to use the calendar before giving up... But it refused to sync. So it's useless;0
There should be add different time schedule in app not be in mobile colander;0
Really frustating configuration...;0
Too complicated. It probably has a lot of, but it's not intuitive enough.;0
In this app it is very hard to use;0
Doesnt work on ALL android Wear OS devices. Specifically, doesnt work with the Watch Active2.;0
No es intuitiva;0
Puts all info in default Google calendar.;0
How it SHOULD work is fantastic and perfect for me. But whenever I have my schedule laid out and planned, the app deletes them or forgets them and i have to start over, only to have them deleted again. I really really want to use it. Why does it make it so unable to?;0
dependant on another calendar app. Why? why do I need to have another app to use this app? I can't add plans or schedule without this app throwing the task to Google Calendar. Besides, I don't use G.C anymore since I once missed an event which I put a reminder through the G.C app because it never reminded me. I read one comment for this app that it never gave a reminder for a scheduled task and yes I have an idea why it happened.;0
Uninstalled...Not at all what I thought it was. This entire app is basically just a fancy way to look at the calendars you already have. Everything syncs both ways, so if you add your actually daily schedule minute by minute to this app you are also cluttering up your calendar(s) with the same things. Would've been neat if it actually had some kind of function, but I don't need to waste sd card space on a calendar viewing app.;0
Not sync with Google Calendar;0
This is Demo Only;0
I like this app. It's just that whenever I enter something in my calendar, it would not sink right away.;0
I wanted to like it, iinitially it looked great but it has such a limited window of time view it's no good for planning. A few hours view and that's it. Scrolling hour by hour day by day? Useless. Its sole function appears to be to tell you what you've got coming up in the next few hours which frankly is not much use to anyone as far as I can see. Cloud Cal uses similar circles with a view of the whole month which would be great but sadly the pro version doesn't work so no go there either.;0
Uninstalled as calendar events keep appearing under the wrong date. Disappointing.;0
cool visual but doesn't work the way I thought it would. I don't like organizing my hour-by-hour tasks through my calendar because it clutters it up and makes me miss my important events. I wanted to use this app thinking that it would allow me to plan my dialy tasks just through the app. But every time I want to plan an event it forces me to do it through my calendar which I don't like. good concept, but I don't see a reason to use it since it just wants me to use my calendar anyway.;0
Used to love it, but the latest version broke it. Couldn't get it to work. All widget face buttons would work for a few seconds then break. Tried all settings, didn't work. Fix it and I'll reconsider my rating.;0
Clicking on the widget doesn't open the app anymore :( :(;0
Good on paper, tried it out and off the bat wouldn't sync any news items, wish it had an option to at least input items directly. Either way didnt work;0
Lnot friendly interface;0
It gives the option to add a local calendar but doesn't let you use it unless you also give permission to use a Google or Outlook calendar. Kind of defeats the purpose of doing a local-only calendar if I can't actually use it.;0
does not work properly , does not update wit hcalendar entries , worst thing , cannot aak my money back!!!!!!!;0
It has a lot of functionality bugs. Some of my events were not adding, after restaring the app, other events just disappeared etc. I m really sorry i had to delete it because it looked nice and could be very useful but it s not working. Thanks!;0
Language of the app doesn't change at all places;0
Its really hard to shedule;0
Not felt user friendly;0
V.V.V.V.BAD;0
Instalei de novo e não mudou muito minha ideia. Quero um calendário e não uma ferramenta pra integração com o calendário do Google. tá de sacanagem;0
Inaccurate - always says activity overlaps with another activity when it doesn't.;0
Nothing work, I have my calendar prepared for months, and nothing come inside the Sectograph, Even I added new one, nothing appeared;0
Want to customize colors buy the pro version. Not a chance. Thanks for nothing b;0
24 hour mode is a PRO feature?!;0
Bought the Paid version. The app fails to get data from anything except Gmail. Good concept but lacks in across provider connectivity.;0
I can't synchronized to my calendar.;0
Dude. Don't we all want people to pay us for everything we come up with. XXXXXXX Hi! Thanks for the attentive reply. Though this app was not worth the payment or storage space for me, I did find one that works nicely. Looking forward to more replies, hopefully relevant, or none at all.;0
Purchased the full version which did nothing. Opted for a 24 hour face, again nothing. Tried to add additional events in upcoming days, did not show up at all.;0
After installing the app, i check to see if my reacurring event would show up. And it did that one time. So minutes after i insalled i had to let it go.;0
Most of My Google calendar events doesn't appear in the sectograph app. If i try to delete some events which is appeared, it cannot remove in the app also. I prefer if the app has own calendar so that events that ill creat might able show easier.;0
Only certain Google calendar entries show in the sectograph making this absolutely pointless. A great idea that is flawed in execution.;0
wew;0
Alarm nahi he;0
It's not working :((;0
Deleted app due to not putting things in I was looking forward to using this app I am getting the same issues as sharlyn;0
The idea is great, however it adds only event to my calendar. I like circle planer idea and that I simply can put work and then event at work and that it reflects on this circle. This has potential but make it simple and functional. I was used to test some apps and for me this was not functional and easy going. Make it that 7 years old kid can use it.;0
It's not working unfortunately. At first it was reflecting then when I added more items, it's no longer working. It just keeps adding the data in the calendar but no graph is being created;0
I just bought pro on my tablet 15 minutes ago and then installed Sectograph on my phone and it says I have to buy pro again. What the heck happened with syncing google accounts;0
it wouldnt sync to my Google calendar I had it set up and everything;0
Very nice app. Could be very useful, but unfortunately does not sync. :(;0
this is very good;0
Difficult to understand. Bit complicated;0
No Outlook Calendar support. Most business people use Outlook...;0
Not a stand alone app. Must use calendar on mobile, my pout was to use it on its own.;0
just an unwanted extension of calendar;0
no use;0
There is no time setting in this graph only dates, that's while.......;0
This program does not work, PERIOD! Installed. Opened. Just sits there at the start screen, frozen and does nothing. No available controls or menu. Nothing. Do not use it. There is nothing to use.;0
Poor interface.;0
not good;0
hard to use. if we could make some changes just by sliding the clock or smthn that would be awesome;0
I hate that you have to use Google calander with this. I may as well just use Google calander. Looking for a better planner to replace it, not exist alongside it. Uninstalled.;0
I liked the app and I really wanna put better rate, but I've got a problem with it.. It has been an hour since I downloaded it,yet I couldn't lay my scadule! I wish there is an option to fix the time region, cuz when ever I forgot to set the zone to my zone, everything is missed up and I have to edit every item again, it is frustrating 😢😢😢;0
this was a great idea in theory, but I want a standalone app that doesn't pull calendar data from some other app. for me and for how I wanted to use this app to manage my schedule, this just won't work. I think it could also be more user-friendly. a shame, since this really is an amazing, unique idea. devs, I hope you keep working on this and take this as constructive criticism. I would love to try this app again if things change and it becomes a more flexible standalone calendar.;0
Synchronisation is not happening. I wailt for 6 hours and hit sync icon many times but it will not appear all events added in Google Calendar.;0
"I love this app! I can no longer install it on my WearOS watch. The app says ""installing"" on the WearOS play store, but never completes. Please fix this!";0
The app is only syncing my all-day events. All other events are not displaying.;0
The widget doesn't auto update after I add an event. Always need to click the manual refresh button. Same goes for when I delete an event.;0
I had it installed for about a month, but didn't find it any easier to use than a normal calendar - in fact I missed a few appointments through using it. It's surprisingly easy to do that as for some reason it doesn't show the whole day or make it clear which party of the day you're looking at. Nice idea, just doesn't provide the at-a-glance info I was hoping for.;0
At first I liked it so I wanted to unlock the Pro features, but this can only be done via In-App purchases which means I'd have to pay over and over again for my family group members to have access to Pro. I hope the developers consider releasing a separate Pro version that can be purchased outright and shared with a Family Group.;0
I have been using the fully unlocked version of this application for over a year. This is a fantastic app! However, it lacks the capability to sync with outlook calendars. For example, if I have subscribed to my work outlook calendar in Google calendar, the events will not be synchronized with Sectograph. This would be fine if this was the documented behavior of this application. However, subscribed-outlook calendars are selectable from the calendar selection menu...;0
Is it possible to use this without connecting it to google calendar??;0
"The app itself is really nice. I like how the widget displays my schedule for the day, it.gives me a very nice grasp of my time. The bad thing is that it slows down my smartphone, I have a S9, and it drains a lot of battery. It makes my phone lag and ""stutter"" when I try to open it. I uninstalled ans reinstalled apps to check my theories, so I uninstalled this one, the phone was doing so much better. And I even PAID for the Pro version!!!";0
Not in sync with my google account. Bad in regards to automatically getting what I planned and plus I can't use it when i am using my PC!!! But thumbs up for this Sectogragh the idea is brilliant. Please work on updates because very soon i might not use it if i still have to re-enter all my days task and activities!!! It should be able to get data from my google account and i should be able to use it on PC. PC is really perfect use for this kind of app!!!;0
very complex ui, it needs Google calendar and doesn't work without it. I needed a app like this but as a daily planner! not just showing the calendar events from Google Calendar stupidly on a clock.;0
This app was exactly what I was looking for. a visual of the day in clock form. Only issue is, if I add something to the clock it adds it to my calendar. I don't want that. I want an app where the calendar and app are separate. This was supposed to be for studying and exercise. I didn't want to have to add those things as into my ready packed calendar. it was a fast uninstall. Iif there was an option to disconnect the two, I'd reinstall.;0
This is exactly the app I was looking for to visual my day, as the clock face just makes sense. However, only being able to add to the schedule via external calendar apps makes this completely unusable. I tried to use it to better manage my routine, but my calendar app became so full of menial tasks that I was unable to see my upcoming appointments and events of most importance. It has amazing potential, but is currently only good for basic planning. Very disappointing.;0
This app doesn't show all the activities of my Google Calender, so to me the app is quite useless. I even checked all the available calendars to make sure the settings were right. However, the concept seems to be great for people with a busy agenda, but since it has no use I unfortunately had to delete this app.;0
Not easy to use quite complicated for just adding a lunch break ect. Sets events from your calendar might as well use that instead;0
Not a fan - liked the idea of diving into main areas and percentage of your day it occupates but what flipped me up was scheduling a reminder - daily. I started getting a morning reminder of the task for the next day schedule for i.e 7pm!!!!! -i mean what about task i have for this day ahead!!! i don't need to be notified 27hrs ahead of my daily rutine - seriously🤮;0
I granted this app full access to my google calendar, but none of my events show up in the diagram. It remains completely empty except for national holidays (like National Tartan Day on April 6th. Yay!) I've given this two stars instead of one because this •could• be awesome. The design is great.;0
Can't sync calendar unless you pay which makes the unpaid version useless to me. I'm not going to go through my entire calendar and add my events by hand to a second calendar. Pointless.;0
Really beautiful and great idea. It is unfortunate for anyone who doesn't buy into all things Google and don't use Google Callander. In this day, building your app to only one service is not a good idea unless it's for the iPhone. Now if I could get my work calendar on this app, wow, what a great way to visualize your day. Just playing with the demo showed me the power of this style.;0
This app doesn't seem to show multiple calenders for the same google account. P.S. In my Google calendar, the desired calendar has got Sync enabled still the issue exists. P.S. 2- In the My Calenders menu, it is not even showing the second calender which I have made for the same google account.;0
I'm going to start by saying who segments their hours on a clock into fifths? That's not standard and just annoying. Second, why can't I add events from the app? It ALWAYS redirects to Google Calendar, so what is this app even good for? I'll just use my calendar, AND it will be easier......;0
It's just a widget. They app description made me think it had a lot more features. And don't get me wrong, it might be the best widget I've seen for my calendar. I really think that the description sets the wrong expectations.;0
i love the ideia but the executation is not good, i want to put reminders for every day and know what i need to do in a clock like that, this app needs his own callendar and clock for we customize without messing up anything on the original apps in the phone, this need a every day reminder, routine and stuff;0
Correct idea worng execution. The watch face UI cannont be operated like manually moving clock hands. The time zone stick moves at an interval of 1hr, I wanted to set it at any choosen time and add reminder from there. Big flop was it did not read my calender event and yes I did give necessary permission. phone - one plus 7 OS build- Oxygen OS 9.5.5 GM57AA Further Action- Uninstalling Outlook- Would like to try it post improvement;0
"I have problem with purchasing the pro version. When I click on ""Buy Pro"" button, it says ""Already purchased. Please restart the app"". I have not yet purchased it though, and nothing happens when I restart the app.";0
Events won't show up on the clock after I adjust the time of the event. They show up, and then I change the time and they disappear. So, so frustrating. :( I wanted to save time, not waste it. :( Why? Why?? ? ?? :( Why?? 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ :( 🤦‍♀️ I used this app for 5 minutes and then hit a roadblock. Why?;0
Wish it didnt have to connect to the calandar. I wanted to keep my phones calandar widget separate from this but its impossible. Disappointing.;0
It would be a great app if it had an option to use it without syncing it to your calendar like TimeTune. I don't want all my tasks to show up on my calendar, and their solution wasn't working.;0
otherwise the app is good but i bought the full version and did i exepet to get customization fratures atleast give to feature to mark different sectors with different colours... very disappointed ... you guys should consider making the user interface less complicated...;0
"Cool concept, but unusable for Google business users because all of your coworkers calendars are selected by default and there's no bulk ""deselect all"" button.";0
After last update the widget became very small, and clicking on it does not open up the full app. Also won't sync to my calendar anymore. Uninstalling.;0
No graph showing - shows the task sector on phone app, but on watch its just the bare bones time with no events charted.;0
There's no simple reminders or ability to add to do task, everything has to be added via calendar which is irritating me...app is useless right now;0
I like the idea, but it's not working with Outlook calendar properly. This a big drawback for me.;0
Doesn't let you choose specific calendar events to ignore. No way to track how you actually spent your time if it didn't match your calendar;0
useful for organizing the activities of the day but don't have setting on sound to notify the time of activity;0
I really like how amazing it is on my phone. But I'm so disappointed to see that it can't be downloaded or visualized on my new galaxy active watch...;0
Not a single event, appointment, meeting, etc...is showing up. going to uninstall after rating.;0
It only works when linked to another calendar app....and it's difficult to change the time from am to pm.....;0
Great idea in principle but it's so hard to work out what's going on that that so far it's useless :-(;0
Couldn't get the rest of my calendars to appear. Feedback help wasn't clear as well. Uninstalling;0
tutorial did not explain much and too confusing to figure out the benefit of using this app.;0
the current day shows events for the next day and seemingly no option to change it. very annoying.;0
Was working fine before. . But it's not working now..not registering my events;0
not exactly useful. was hoping it would be easier to see or more customizable.;0
It was a good app until this most recent update now my widget doesn't work it's not syncing with my calendars I'm losing dates appointments;0
Certain of the event doesn't show up in the clock, just recorded in my calender.;0
"I dont like that it only works with calendar. i dont want a calendar even called ""sleep"" just to keep it on the graph";0
I loved this app, but after the new update I am unable to use the widget. Uninstalled.;0
Ok good to know, thanks! It still won't show all of my calendar items on the clock. I'll put some on and it will take them off as I add more.;0
I like this app but it's always saying it has stopped on my phone;0
No option for reminders, it doesn't show reminders of my google calendar. And i dont wanna create events for my daily habits LOL;0
Hello Team, I am not able to set different colours for different sectors. Could you please help me show how its done?? I purchased your app in light that It will give me option for above.;0
I don't use Microsoft or Google calendars please integrate with time tree app calendar so I can use your app.;0
when adding a task it transferring you to Google calendar then after adding the event it doesn't appear on the widget?;0
hi i can add just 1 event why i try to add more in google calendar it shown but in this app it's not show up;0
Wish it didn't force me to use Google calendar. I wanted to start a new calender off of this app;0
Does not support more than only one Outlook calendar;0
I'm just not finding time to work with this app. So by no means the star rank im giving the apl is just a TEMP ranking.;0
doesn't sync to my smartwatch 😞;0
Once installed the app was showing another time zone.;0
The widget is feezing after every night;0
No adding option for the time;0
couldn't change time zone, its an hour ahead and no setting to select my time zone;0
It good and useful app;0
it is so stupid that i have to be coneccted to my calender and cant just create what i want. to much work not worth it;0
Didnt inform me. No alerts. Deleted on the first day;0
I would like to see it in the lock screen.;0
I downloaded it but don't know how to use it ...really messed up app;0
Not flexible enough for my needs;0
Widget out of memory;0
couldn't exactly figure out how to use it;0
Never tried it yet;0
Does not show reminders;0
It dont have Alarm feature;0
It does not ync eith al the calendars;0
Sync is not good;0
too confusing not neat;0
Don't know how to use;0
Updated: I want to love this but like others have said, it doesn't work with all calendars as claimed. To get Outlook or any other calendar to work, you have to have your calendar sync with Google, which not everyone wants or can do. It also only works with Google's smart watch, not Android Wear OS smart watches. Great look and idea, but very limited by being Google only.;0
Acceptable;0
good;0
Not good;0
Very confusing. When problems occur the resolution isnt made clear.;0
I'm sure it would be great if it didn't pick and chose what events to display from my calendar. I have multiple events logged in my calendar, the only calendar it's synced to and the only calendar those events are logged on, yet just one of them shows up. It has a lovely design, but that doesn't mean anything when the app doesn't actually work for what it's intended for.;0
Can't adjust center clock size. Can't open alarms by touching the center clock. The image for opening the app on the play store doesn't represent what you can customize the clock to look like as a widget. Augh. Cool but lacking necessary functions.  EDIT - I was not able to click the center clock and open my alarms. Not sure why. But the developer said it is possible.;0
In my last phone, Asus Zenfone C, I can use this app well, but after I changed my phone to Samsung J7 (2016), it automatically connects with either Samsung or Google calendar, where I can't edit the event colors freely on the clock. I'm very disappointed, so I had to uninstall. Sorry.;0
I couldn't sync this with my work email and doesn't seem to give me the option to.;0
To complicated and let's you set things up only to then tell u It's not available;0
It just keep on showing only one event whereas there are more than one events;0
The only thing that is missing is to open specified event after click on a widget. For now I can give for stars. I'll give more when this feature will be available :)  Edit: after upgrade adding widget to homescreen only allocates place but is invisible. When it finally showed up it doesn't have promissed functionality;0
I love the idea but there are syncing issues.  Events take forever to show on the graph regardless of whether i entered them in the sectograph app or my google calendar.  They show up in my google calender almost automatically regardless of the same.  Also i think 12 hour clock makes it tricky to read since the switch from am to pm is in the middle of the day.  I have something starting at 12:30 and i cant see it on the sectograph but there is a little arrow at that start time with the first letter of that event and nothing else.  It's confusing.;0
Good app, missing vital a feature - it shows meetings not being attended. I.e. Going = No.  That is an obvious feature that stops me from giving a good rating, I must keep company meetings in the calendar that I'm not attending for posterity - not unreasonable I think? So this is a must.;0
Widget out of memory;0

Not flexible enough for my needs;0
Wish it didnt have to connect to the calandar. I wanted to keep my phones calandar widget separate from this but its impossible. Disappointing.;0
it is so stupid that i have to be coneccted to my calender and cant just create what i want. to much work not worth it;0
very complex ui, it needs Google calendar and doesn't work without it. I needed a app like this but as a daily planner! not just showing the calendar events from Google Calendar stupidly on a clock.;0
The widget doesn't auto update after I add an event. Always need to click the manual refresh button. Same goes for when I delete an event.;0
Can't sync calendar unless you pay which makes the unpaid version useless to me. I'm not going to go through my entire calendar and add my events by hand to a second calendar. Pointless.;0
I have been using the fully unlocked version of this application for over a year. This is a fantastic app! However, it lacks the capability to sync with outlook calendars. For example, if I have subscribed to my work outlook calendar in Google calendar, the events will not be synchronized with Sectograph. This would be fine if this was the documented behavior of this application. However, subscribed-outlook calendars are selectable from the calendar selection menu...;0
Ok good to know, thanks! It still won't show all of my calendar items on the clock. I'll put some on and it will take them off as I add more.;0
It was a good app until this most recent update now my widget doesn't work it's not syncing with my calendars I'm losing dates appointments;0
After last update the widget became very small, and clicking on it does not open up the full app. Also won't sync to my calendar anymore. Uninstalling.;0
Wish it didn't force me to use Google calendar. I wanted to start a new calender off of this app;0
Don't know how to use;0
This is exactly the app I was looking for to visual my day, as the clock face just makes sense. However, only being able to add to the schedule via external calendar apps makes this completely unusable. I tried to use it to better manage my routine, but my calendar app became so full of menial tasks that I was unable to see my upcoming appointments and events of most importance. It has amazing potential, but is currently only good for basic planning. Very disappointing.;0
It just keep on showing only one event whereas there are more than one events;0
Events won't show up on the clock after I adjust the time of the event. They show up, and then I change the time and they disappear. So, so frustrating. :( I wanted to save time, not waste it. :( Why? Why?? ? ?? :( Why?? 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ :( 🤦‍♀️ I used this app for 5 minutes and then hit a roadblock. Why?;0
No adding option for the time;0
Great idea in principle but it's so hard to work out what's going on that that so far it's useless :-(;0
I'm going to start by saying who segments their hours on a clock into fifths? That's not standard and just annoying. Second, why can't I add events from the app? It ALWAYS redirects to Google Calendar, so what is this app even good for? I'll just use my calendar, AND it will be easier......;0
Was working fine before. . But it's not working now..not registering my events;0
I really like how amazing it is on my phone. But I'm so disappointed to see that it can't be downloaded or visualized on my new galaxy active watch...;0
Sync is not good;0
"Cool concept, but unusable for Google business users because all of your coworkers calendars are selected by default and there's no bulk ""deselect all"" button.";0
It dont have Alarm feature;0
"I have problem with purchasing the pro version. When I click on ""Buy Pro"" button, it says ""Already purchased. Please restart the app"". I have not yet purchased it though, and nothing happens when I restart the app.";0
Never tried it yet;0
Does not support more than only one Outlook calendar;0
Certain of the event doesn't show up in the clock, just recorded in my calender.;0
Not in sync with my google account. Bad in regards to automatically getting what I planned and plus I can't use it when i am using my PC!!! But thumbs up for this Sectogragh the idea is brilliant. Please work on updates because very soon i might not use it if i still have to re-enter all my days task and activities!!! It should be able to get data from my google account and i should be able to use it on PC. PC is really perfect use for this kind of app!!!;0
This app doesn't seem to show multiple calenders for the same google account. P.S. In my Google calendar, the desired calendar has got Sync enabled still the issue exists. P.S. 2- In the My Calenders menu, it is not even showing the second calender which I have made for the same google account.;0
Not that good after using;0
It does not ync eith al the calendars;0
I downloaded it but don't know how to use it ...really messed up app;0
It good and useful app;0
This app was exactly what I was looking for. a visual of the day in clock form. Only issue is, if I add something to the clock it adds it to my calendar. I don't want that. I want an app where the calendar and app are separate. This was supposed to be for studying and exercise. I didn't want to have to add those things as into my ready packed calendar. it was a fast uninstall. Iif there was an option to disconnect the two, I'd reinstall.;0
No option for reminders, it doesn't show reminders of my google calendar. And i dont wanna create events for my daily habits LOL;0
I'm just not finding time to work with this app. So by no means the star rank im giving the apl is just a TEMP ranking.;0
i love the ideia but the executation is not good, i want to put reminders for every day and know what i need to do in a clock like that, this app needs his own callendar and clock for we customize without messing up anything on the original apps in the phone, this need a every day reminder, routine and stuff;0
The widget is feezing after every night;0
couldn't change time zone, its an hour ahead and no setting to select my time zone;0
Does not show reminders;0
Correct idea worng execution. The watch face UI cannont be operated like manually moving clock hands. The time zone stick moves at an interval of 1hr, I wanted to set it at any choosen time and add reminder from there. Big flop was it did not read my calender event and yes I did give necessary permission. phone - one plus 7 OS build- Oxygen OS 9.5.5 GM57AA Further Action- Uninstalling Outlook- Would like to try it post improvement;0
"I dont like that it only works with calendar. i dont want a calendar even called ""sleep"" just to keep it on the graph";0
couldn't exactly figure out how to use it;0
the current day shows events for the next day and seemingly no option to change it. very annoying.;0
Not a fan - liked the idea of diving into main areas and percentage of your day it occupates but what flipped me up was scheduling a reminder - daily. I started getting a morning reminder of the task for the next day schedule for i.e 7pm!!!!! -i mean what about task i have for this day ahead!!! i don't need to be notified 27hrs ahead of my daily rutine - seriously🤮;0
when adding a task it transferring you to Google calendar then after adding the event it doesn't appear on the widget?;0
Not a single event, appointment, meeting, etc...is showing up. going to uninstall after rating.;0
"The app itself is really nice. I like how the widget displays my schedule for the day, it.gives me a very nice grasp of my time. The bad thing is that it slows down my smartphone, I have a S9, and it drains a lot of battery. It makes my phone lag and ""stutter"" when I try to open it. I uninstalled ans reinstalled apps to check my theories, so I uninstalled this one, the phone was doing so much better. And I even PAID for the Pro version!!!";0
I granted this app full access to my google calendar, but none of my events show up in the diagram. It remains completely empty except for national holidays (like National Tartan Day on April 6th. Yay!) I've given this two stars instead of one because this •could• be awesome. The design is great.;0
Updated: I want to love this but like others have said, it doesn't work with all calendars as claimed. To get Outlook or any other calendar to work, you have to have your calendar sync with Google, which not everyone wants or can do. It also only works with Google's smart watch, not Android Wear OS smart watches. Great look and idea, but very limited by being Google only.;0
Acceptable;0
not exactly useful. was hoping it would be easier to see or more customizable.;0
doesn't sync to my smartwatch 😞;0
Hello Team, I am not able to set different colours for different sectors. Could you please help me show how its done?? I purchased your app in light that It will give me option for above.;0
tutorial did not explain much and too confusing to figure out the benefit of using this app.;0
otherwise the app is good but i bought the full version and did i exepet to get customization fratures atleast give to feature to mark different sectors with different colours... very disappointed ... you guys should consider making the user interface less complicated...;0
It would be a great app if it had an option to use it without syncing it to your calendar like TimeTune. I don't want all my tasks to show up on my calendar, and their solution wasn't working.;0
good;0
useful for organizing the activities of the day but don't have setting on sound to notify the time of activity;0
I like this app but it's always saying it has stopped on my phone;0
There's no simple reminders or ability to add to do task, everything has to be added via calendar which is irritating me...app is useless right now;0
Not good;0
hi i can add just 1 event why i try to add more in google calendar it shown but in this app it's not show up;0
too confusing not neat;0
Really beautiful and great idea. It is unfortunate for anyone who doesn't buy into all things Google and don't use Google Callander. In this day, building your app to only one service is not a good idea unless it's for the iPhone. Now if I could get my work calendar on this app, wow, what a great way to visualize your day. Just playing with the demo showed me the power of this style.;0
No graph showing - shows the task sector on phone app, but on watch its just the bare bones time with no events charted.;0
Once installed the app was showing another time zone.;0
Doesn't let you choose specific calendar events to ignore. No way to track how you actually spent your time if it didn't match your calendar;0
This app doesn't show all the activities of my Google Calender, so to me the app is quite useless. I even checked all the available calendars to make sure the settings were right. However, the concept seems to be great for people with a busy agenda, but since it has no use I unfortunately had to delete this app.;0
I loved this app, but after the new update I am unable to use the widget. Uninstalled.;0
It only works when linked to another calendar app....and it's difficult to change the time from am to pm.....;0
Couldn't get the rest of my calendars to appear. Feedback help wasn't clear as well. Uninstalling;0
I like the idea, but it's not working with Outlook calendar properly. This a big drawback for me.;0
Does not sync with MS Exchange calendar;0
Pllllzzzzz make it for ios also;0
Very confusing. When problems occur the resolution isnt made clear.;0
I'm sure it would be great if it didn't pick and chose what events to display from my calendar. I have multiple events logged in my calendar, the only calendar it's synced to and the only calendar those events are logged on, yet just one of them shows up. It has a lovely design, but that doesn't mean anything when the app doesn't actually work for what it's intended for.;0
To complicated and let's you set things up only to then tell u It's not available;0
Work well as my need, except it can not be watch face on Samsung watch. I try it several days and love it. So I purchase the pro version, wish to use it on my watch as it said can be used with Android. I didn't know that Samsung watch is different OS, so it's incompatible :( However, the developer show responsibility by refunding the money. Anyway, I still hope it will be able to use with Samsung watch soon. Keep up the good work!;1
I am using the paid version and this is really good, love it. Quick question...I want to integrate this with the Samsung smart watch. Is this possible, otherwise deserves 5 stars. Please add option to integrate more than 1 outlook email calender Account and also themed design faces we can choose from for us who are bad at colors.;1
I love this app. I just wish that there was an internal calendar in it so that I didn't have to create and turn on a calendar in Google Calendars in order to receive alerts for events in Sectograph.;1
I use the paid version, and the 24 dial is magnificent and very useful to visualize your whole day. But I need to view this on my Samsung watch. How to do so? provided that o see a Smart watch options in the settings.;1
Very nice and innovative calander app only one thing is multiple widget like squre and rectangle also Widget event font was very small there should be option to increase font size to proper visibility....also it show next event instead of curren event... thanks;1
Interesting alternative to combined calendars and notes. Very visual approach that allows to focus on what matters. Time is a scarce and unvaluable commodity. Let's manage it as it should !;1
An excellent time keeping tool. Would it be possible to have a separate 12-hour widget and another 24-hour widget? And it seems that the manual update button in the Home screen widget is not working for Microsoft Outlook.;1
Great. Really helps me visually percieve all my tasks with time. Wish the interphase was more customizable tho.;1
I've been using the app for quite a while, and it seems to work well with Google Calendar, showing my events for the day as claimed by the devs. While I have not experienced any issues and the widget is a must-have on my home screen, customisation options are very limited for free users. That's not a big deal, but I do wish we had at least a bit more.;1
I really like this app I find the the way it presents the data in a clock face with countdowns to your EVENTS very useful. The one drawback for me is that it doesn't integrate with Google Tasks or Reminders. This means that everything you want to see needs to be created as an event. This is not a massive deal but I do like the convenience of tasks over events. The widget sometimes loses synchronisation with the clock and shows a different time than the actual time.;1
"Very close to being 5 stars. There are just a few oddities in the user interface (and possibly slight inconsistencies on what the app is doing) who means that for some the word ""buggy"" might be applied. I'm more inclined to say ""unpolished"" in certain areas... But a great app none the less";1
Useful but still needs more integration to Outlook ... I'd like to load my colour categories that I already have in outlook calendar in my visualization. Calendar by week numbers is also a must have ... I'd like to know also the percentage of availability of each day based on my events. It could also integrate with my alarm in order to know at what time I wake up ... and so on. The potential of this app is huge;1
One of the best productivity apps on the Play Store. I had recently purchased the app to customize the widget and colors but find it difficult because it could not load the existing wallpaper I am using, on the preview. It is also hard to try and mix different colors to see. It would be best to have the customization be seen real time rather than pick and see color. Thank you.;1
This is a good apps. But I think it will be better if the widget will show in the lockscreen too. So it will be easier to check the plan. But offer all this is a good apps. Still find no problem up till now. Maybe I'll try the premium version to see the more features.;1
Easy to use. Love the format. And widget format as well. Works perfect for my frienfs business that i work for... I can help him get and stay organized and were less likely to forget important things. I love how i can organize the scedule and set reminders while im at home relaxing and he can instantly have it on his phone as well. Barely any adds which is awesome!!! GREAT APP for what i use it for and im sure it can be great for alot of different situations. :);1
It is a great app, buy there are some problems, your widget mostly do not sync automatically with my phone's clock, so eventually I have to open the app and set the widget to match the clock. Please fix this, thank you very much.;1
"Good app and so close to what i was looking for, but it's missing one thing. If you could add an option to add your own tasks WITHOUT it having to be an actual event that'd be awesome. I don't want to add ""wake up"" or ""gym"" as an event in my calendar.";1
Good app, but not exactly what I was looking for. This app uses your calendar events and organizes them in the circle. The controls are great, I love when I move the red time bar it scrolls through all the things and shows the time changing. Love the widget. I wanted this to work out a homeschool schedule. I ended up having to make a new calendar and syncing only that one. I was able to change the colors of each event in the app. Very easy to use overall.;1
I used to have this as my default watch face, but lately I can't put this on my Android Wear device. Maybe my Ticwatch is too old for the latest version, but it used to be the best. Does anyone know how to put this watchface on their Android Wear if it doesn't show up automatically?;1
It took me a while to understand how to use certain features, but once I did I found it to be EXACTLY what I needed! If Google would allow reminders to come through, it would be the PERFECT time management tool! My only thought would be if there was some sort of tutorial or guide to help know what some things were for (like when I'm changing the color scheme, I can't always tell what's what) For those not wanting their calendar clogged up, just make those things hidden after you've added them.;1
Just please add reminders / notifications with custom sound 🔊 and more colors 😊 and please make the wedge /icon display description of the event or auto degrease the letters size to fit more than 1 word or add a fieldnto type title that will be shown/edited in the app even it comes from another planner without titles. 🙄;1
This is good application for the procrastinators who usually wasted their time on phone without any reason. I like the sectograph because it let me push to do the work of hat makes any sense. So I recommend you to use this application 🤗;1
I like the concept, and the free version is passable, but it seems like a lot of features are locked behind the pay version. I may end up purchasing, not sure yet.;1
This is seriously good and so far it has worked flawlessly. Just that, sometimes, it takes a bit of time to update the calendar entry on the app. But i don't mind.;1
Very good app. The only note is that it takes a while to make it syncronizing properly. But after you get it, works like a charm.;1
Good app but I can't get it to shade in the entire timeframes of my activities like in the photos here. It only has a line at the end time.;1
Really fun view of your day. Still figuring out how to use it well. It would be nice for the widget palette to also be visible inside the app but it's not a huge issue. I could easily see myself changing to 5 stars once I get used to it.;1
The app is real good and helps in improving the productivity! An improvement that could be made is to hasten the sync up with the calendar. It is taking quite a long time to reflect in the sectrograph after adding any new event!;1
Very nice app but, 1 Reminders are not showing in the app. 2 All day events start from 12 in the app which makes them less readable when there are many all day events so, better make it customizable.;1
Really nicely made and very useful app and always a looker for others! Recently however, it always shows some phantom alarm clocks I did not set...;1
Great APP! Detailed yet concise (with only the information I need). Amazingly, it is packaged together with one APP so effectively.;1
Cute, love it but bugs, no alarms that's the only thing keeping it from being 5 stars for me.;1
Good Android widget: 👉For watching planned schedules everytime at ease on the home screen. 👉 For syncing all calenders to view birthdays & events at one place.;1
Really like it. Would love to be able to manually resize appointments and add new appointments into arcs with free time.;1
Annoying that you can't change the color background of the dial with the free version but otherwise very useful and fun to use;1
I love this app but sadly it does not work with active 2 watch. Imagine the possibilities if you could have this widget on a wearable .;1
Really great, but no project-task relationships that i could find. So grouping things is hard except coloring them manually;1
Love this app! All time based/entire day events in visually streamlined view.;1
It's really a good app,but they need to add some more features to it like copy schedule and some other good features.;1
Love love love this app... but you guys can add some more features to make it a bit more easier to use..;1
thanks to you, this app makes me more concentrated and schedulable in my days, and its efficient visual time widget on the home screen is really practical. But sync between calendar and app is a little time-consuming.;1
Best app. Works perfect but giving 4 stars due to colour settings, whenever you try to change colour of tasks there is a problem that you touch a colour and it selects other colour like touch red colour it selects blue. This problem is in all colours.;1
Great app to track your daily schedule. One thing what would be great to have here - displaying the scheduled reminders from google calendar. Unfortunately I do not see them.;1
It takes some getting used to but then when you start thinking of it as an analog watch it sort of works.;1
Good visualisation. Would be great if the widget came in a dark version as well and transparency could be set.;1
This is a great app, but i dun like it link to my calendar, because it will mess them up. Prefer if this is a standalone calendar, so that i can separate my schedule in this app, and other schedule in my calendar;1
I like the app/ widget, i wish the center was a lil bigger or bold. I havent had an issue withit, other than that.;1
Now realize will not show appointments over 12 hours out, however would think should see them in overall list, but not on widget....good but could be just tad better.;1
Very cool app for keeping track of your tasks and schedule;1
Very good Well, it's a great app. I just wish we had more free features. It would be a rmgrest investment.;1
Very effective. I would give 5 stars ,but writting space too little. Larger writting space will help much better.;1
If alarm connected, will be the best one.;1
Wish for larger text. Difficult to read.;1
You can add one thing, when we'll touch on particular time period then the particular task should be displayed.;1
I really like the app. it's pretty cool! How do I get the 24 HR clock on my Android wear? 5 stars if the 24hr face can is possible on the watch! 🙂;1
Nice App but not able to use widget (Nokia 2.1 , Android Pie);1
Very good app! Helps me stay organized.;1
App is great overall, but unless I'm missing something obvious I can't seem to put the widget on my home screen?;1
Glitches with all day events in outlook;1
It's really a great app to organize your life. Good experience 😃;1
"Best watch once you understand it. It takes a while to set up just the way you want it and to actually ""get it"", but once you do it does exactly what it promises. Its sleek yet informative and by far the best ""at a glance"" app for your homescreen. The watch addon is the cherry on the cake. Only improvement in my opinion would be to add multiple different widgets. Like give me the option for a small simple one on my home screen and a bigger more detailed one on my office screen for instance.";1
I love this widget!! It's such a clear picture of the time and schedule!! My only thing is I wish it was compatible for the galaxy watch! I got the app because I saw it on the watch I'm the pictures but it doesn't work with the galaxy watch. 😕 If this was improved to work with the watch I would give it 5++ stars.;1
Its really smart idea to see at a glance from your homescreen all your planned activities;1
I started using this app in 11th std & I'm getting its benifit but the only thing is that it doesnt shows the tasks we have to complete in some monutes or if two tasks are to be completed simultaneously in a hour. So I humbly request to make some more changes in this app so that everyone can use it more comfortably.;1
I like this app. If it can sync easily and automatically without delay, I will give it 5 stars;1
I really love this app for so many reasons. Above all it's keeps me organized and punctual. What I wish I could change, or maybe I can and just can figure out how, is how to make the widget color pallet settings the same on my OS Wear. thats why I bought the extra options innthe first place. My watch face doesnt even look like it does in the photos. Can I change this!?;1
This app is amazing. I use it to show all my Google calendar events as sectors on a 24 hour clock. I just have one feedback, I wish there was an option to divide the clock into two colored sector, based on from when sunlight is available and when it's not. The idea of ligh/dark period seems more practical than the usual AM/PM. Or maybe, provide a custom rotation to the dial, for eg., i would want the day to start from the time I go to bed. And thanks for this great app. Highly recommended.;1
I like it, also I would like, like a wedget but for the block screen. Then you don't need to open the phone, only activate the screen in order to see the next task in your calendar;1
Seems good for people who use a calendar already, but I hate Google calenders and Outlook alike. I couldn't figure out how to create my schedule without using one of those terrible calendars so I uninstalled.;1
A great tool to see what's going on in your day. I linked work and personal calendars into one. The customisable buttons are a nice touch and allow you to make it work the way you want it to.;1
I think it's pretty cool how this app communicate with the calender, smart watch greatly enhanced the experience as well, good job. I just wish there was a galaxy watch version of it. :(;1
"EDITED - read second paragraph. Hi, not sure if I'm missing out a setting but the app does not display all the events in a day. It makes sense to show only the events in a 12 hr time frame on the clock face, but the list of events should include all tasks of the day -- instead of us having to ""fast forward"" the day until the events appear. I did not mean ""tasks"", poor choice of words on my part. I meant that if I have an event at 9pm today, and the time now is 6am, I will not see this at all. The clock face only shows 12 hrs: this makes sense. The list of events below the clock should probably show events for the whole day, though.";1
I think it's by far one of the best apps out there. It integrates well with the default calendar app, and really helps you to track your day. Tons of customizable buttons, and even the clock face itself from the hour/minute arms colour and thickness/length, to the placement of the numbers on the clockface. I love how it displays the time remaining to your next meeting, task or alarm. Widget is pretty good and you have full functionality from the comfort of your home screen. Lock Screen display??;1
Made outlook play nicely by just importing my outlook calendars to google calendar. so that was pretty easy really.  I love the widget on my phone, it looks good, works nicely, it's awesome. The phone-clockface however can't be configured I can't find any option to add my business-calendar and some shared calendars to the clock face, it seems to only show my primary calendar (which apart from my own birthday is completely emtpy). (I'm aware that on Android one can select calendars, they just don't reflect over to the android watchface);1
I've been using this app and the watch face on my Moto 360 for close to about a year now. With all my events for the day (and the next day) visible on my wrist, I can keep track of my calendar easily. However recently, the watch face is defaulting to 'Simple Clock' (default watch face) whenever I use the watch. It only affects Sectograph and it has been bugging me since.;1
I bought the pro version and like it so far. For now what I'm really missing is the ability to change days from the widget itself, with the left and right arrows, and not only from inside the app. Why wouldn't you enable the left and right arrows to change day as default? Having to go into the app to review past or coming days defeats the purpose of the widget, and forces you to use something else other than the widget itself. Other than that, the app seems to be very practical. If the ability to swipe from one day to the next day or to the last day from the widget gets implemented, it would be a 5 star app for me. Thanks.;1
Really love the app. Helps me organize my time and schedule. If you could just make the hours numbering in front of the sector, and adding an option for showing minute division lines would really help to read it better. Setting the hours numbering outside the clock makes it look kinda crowded, and with some of the hour numbers (12, 3, 6, 9) not shown kinda bothers me. Also please make a preview of the clock in the settings so we won't need to switch from the app to the homescreen to see the changes. Really looking forward to see these features fixed. Overall, great app!;1
This is an excellent application. The interface is fresh and new, and provides a new way to look at your day. I only wish that it could be made to be resized a little larger, as well as show all day events below in a list format as they are small around the bezel. Apart from that, it is a solid 5 stars!!;1
Excellent and useful! I wish I had a smart watch to put it on but it's good on my phone too. Occasionally the widget can glitch and turn invisible but it will come back. The outside clock face numbers are only black? Can't see them on my background and can't figure out how to change them. The widget palette is great, but I can imagine customization with background images of clock faces, different hand shapes, and/or color gradients to make it look really impressive!;1
This is so helpful! I use this with the forest app to stay on task. You can add different calenders from Google and keep work and personal separate.;1
Do you have plans to support Office 365 and outlook calendars directly.   Currently, I am syncing my calendars to Google but it's not a pleasant experience as the sync keeps failing on one or other calendar.    Due to this reason, I am stopping sectograph and moving to outlook widget :-(  For those who are on google calendar, it's an excellent app and the developer support is awesome.   I'm rating 4 only for the dependency on google calendar.;1
Been using this app for a short while. So far so good. It's purely a visual of events, time, and alarms, while all the actual event management still happens through the Google Calendar app, and which I think is brilliant. Still figuring out the app.... Like how does one track time on it? 🤔;1
Quite useful little widget. I only wish I had control over which calendar it used. it seems to only pick up the Google/Samsung and I would like to use the widget for my repetitive schedule AND a second widget for my daily planner. There is the ability to select which calendar within the Google app I want to use, but that just makes the calendar side messy. Two separate app calendar selection would solve this for me, unless anyone has a better idea how I can get around this? Still, thank you dev;1
I like it so far and I bought the 24 hours extension. The only complain that I have is the buttons that sit on the four corners of the widget is very hard to precisely click. I got very frustrated every time I try to click it. Most of the time it'lll trigger to move the widget itself. ☹️;1
great so far, it would be nice to allow the 5 buttons on the widget have an option to skip a day, week or month forward or backward, if i would like to look ahead i have to open one or two apps when it could be a button you set on the widget. maybe even a button option that allows one widget to switch between multiple calendars, just thought id include that suggestion.;1
This app is the simplest thing yet it makes such a big difference in my daily life. I would only add the option to see the details of each task on the widget (right now it opens the app by default which is not a major issue but It would be an improvement). Thank you for making my life easier!;1
Awesome new idea for a productivity widget. Significantly more useful than a calendar or list of upcoming events. the one thing I would like to change would be the display of numbers on arcs. It looks kind of silly near the center of the circle when the numbers twist and overlap. Change that, 5 stars.;1
I like it a lot until you have overlapping times for your schedule or events.... It's too hard to tell which one you are looking at cuz it only shows one. Unless you touch it or open it but that defeats the purpose of it, it's for a quick glance. Fix that n ur golden.;1
Neat, but I don't put that much stuff on my calendar.. Looking for more of a scheduling tool for everyday routines. Don't want to add all that stuff to my calendar.;1
Had written a bad review because I spent a week trying to make the app show two widgets with different calendars. Couldn't do it (and wasted hours!) until I noticed a nearly invisible dot (at least on my screen, I'm using the iblue app) near the widgets. Pressed it and discovered the widget menu! They should really make it stick out or write clear instructions about it on the app. I imagine they try to make it subtle in order to not affect how the app looks, but it took a week to find it.;1
Pros: I loved the visual representation of events and Integration with Google calendar. Cons: It isn't integrated with Google tasks. Most of the users would use Tasks to track their activities, along with Calendars. I would love to purchase the Pro version and rate it 5 stars if integrated with Google Tasks.;1
A very good Pie chart graphical view of your schedule with nice colours and everything is good about the app specially the graphical side. I'm not a pro owner but also rating 4 stars because of the glitch in app today. My whole sector were invisible today and it just showed blue colour filled circle with only an area of 45° looking as faded blue. And nothing else was there. I also have screen shot of the error if developers need it. Else it's a great app. Soon will buy the pro version.;1
Very nice app and easy to use;1
I use this to help me see what my day looks like. The circular shape helps me related to easier. I know and I have open spots and I know and I am busy. It sinks with Google so I don't have to import information multiple times. Really like it.;1
It's probably the closest app to what I'm looking for. I'd really like to be able to either style or disable monochrome mode, and have the option to use the same style between the watch face and home widget so I don't have to go back and forth in the settings to make them match;1
My favorite aspect of this app is the visual organization of my daily events! It's a great little widget for people who need to keep track of their life but literally always forget to open the calendar app. I would like to see more color custom options 😊;1
I really love this free app. It's so cool to see my schedule visually and know how much time I have until the next event. The only thing I would change (and this may already be available in the paid version) is the ability to choose different colors for each event.;1
It's a neat idea and I've I tweeked the display settings I was able to make it easier to read. There are some features that could be explained better though. overall it's a interesting way to see what's on your schedule.;1
Very nice setup. Thought enough of it to pay for premium. Couple things - add ability to change watch hand colors (arms match scheduled event making it impossible to see) - add ability to increase watch face inner diameter digital time (difficult to read). Watch = Ticwatch Pro 4g Phone = Moto Z3 w/Pie;1
Recommend to try it. 4 starts as nothing is perfect. Not because it isn't good enough.;1
Good step learning curve;1
How can i change the notification sound ?;1
Does exactly what it said it would;1
I've been using the app for quite a while, and it seems to work well with Google Calendar, showing my events for the day as claimed by the devs. While I have not experienced any issues and the widget is a must-have on my home screen, customisation options are very limited for free users. That's not a big deal, but I do wish we had at least a bit more.;1
I like this app. If it can sync easily and automatically without delay, I will give it 5 stars;1
I use the paid version, and the 24 dial is magnificent and very useful to visualize your whole day. But I need to view this on my Samsung watch. How to do so? provided that o see a Smart watch options in the settings.;1
Very nice and innovative calander app only one thing is multiple widget like squre and rectangle also Widget event font was very small there should be option to increase font size to proper visibility....also it show next event instead of curren event... thanks;1
Good apk;1
Great. Really helps me visually percieve all my tasks with time. Wish the interphase was more customizable tho.;1
I love this app. I just wish that there was an internal calendar in it so that I didn't have to create and turn on a calendar in Google Calendars in order to receive alerts for events in Sectograph.;1
I'm still looking forward to it's impacts at this point.;1
Excelente aplicação. Boa integração com Google Calendar e facilita a Gestão do dia e da semana. Parabéns aos desenvolvedores.;1
I'm still trying to figure out all out. I'm unsure if I want to buy the upgrade. But I like the idea of it.;1
Work well as my need, except it can not be watch face on Samsung watch. I try it several days and love it. So I purchase the pro version, wish to use it on my watch as it said can be used with Android. I didn't know that Samsung watch is different OS, so it's incompatible :( However, the developer show responsibility by refunding the money. Anyway, I still hope it will be able to use with Samsung watch soon. Keep up the good work!;1
Really like this app;1
I am using the paid version and this is really good, love it. Quick question...I want to integrate this with the Samsung smart watch. Is this possible, otherwise deserves 5 stars. Please add option to integrate more than 1 outlook email calender Account and also themed design faces we can choose from for us who are bad at colors.;1
Interesting alternative to combined calendars and notes. Very visual approach that allows to focus on what matters. Time is a scarce and unvaluable commodity. Let's manage it as it should !;1
Like the latest updates, thanks;1
An excellent time keeping tool. Would it be possible to have a separate 12-hour widget and another 24-hour widget? And it seems that the manual update button in the Home screen widget is not working for Microsoft Outlook.;1
Good App;1
If alarm connected, will be the best one.;1
I like the concept, and the free version is passable, but it seems like a lot of features are locked behind the pay version. I may end up purchasing, not sure yet.;1
Glitches with all day events in outlook;1
It is a great app, buy there are some problems, your widget mostly do not sync automatically with my phone's clock, so eventually I have to open the app and set the widget to match the clock. Please fix this, thank you very much.;1
Good app;1
I used to have this as my default watch face, but lately I can't put this on my Android Wear device. Maybe my Ticwatch is too old for the latest version, but it used to be the best. Does anyone know how to put this watchface on their Android Wear if it doesn't show up automatically?;1
Love this app! All time based/entire day events in visually streamlined view.;1
very nice app, except Saving everything to my calandar.;1
Lets me see my schedule VISUALLY, neat.;1
"Very close to being 5 stars. There are just a few oddities in the user interface (and possibly slight inconsistencies on what the app is doing) who means that for some the word ""buggy"" might be applied. I'm more inclined to say ""unpolished"" in certain areas... But a great app none the less";1
It's ok. But I can't put the clock onto my home screen.;1
It's good. Can still be improved. Looking forward to it.;1
Very useful;1
Its really smart idea to see at a glance from your homescreen all your planned activities;1
Very nice app but, 1 Reminders are not showing in the app. 2 All day events start from 12 in the app which makes them less readable when there are many all day events so, better make it customizable.;1
Good;1
this is good app and it has a beutiful widget;1
Nice layout;1
Easy to use. Love the format. And widget format as well. Works perfect for my frienfs business that i work for... I can help him get and stay organized and were less likely to forget important things. I love how i can organize the scedule and set reminders while im at home relaxing and he can instantly have it on his phone as well. Barely any adds which is awesome!!! GREAT APP for what i use it for and im sure it can be great for alot of different situations. :);1
It's really a great app to organize your life. Good experience 😃;1
I love this app but sadly it does not work with active 2 watch. Imagine the possibilities if you could have this widget on a wearable .;1
One of the best productivity apps on the Play Store. I had recently purchased the app to customize the widget and colors but find it difficult because it could not load the existing wallpaper I am using, on the preview. It is also hard to try and mix different colors to see. It would be best to have the customization be seen real time rather than pick and see color. Thank you.;1
Great APP! Detailed yet concise (with only the information I need). Amazingly, it is packaged together with one APP so effectively.;1
It's really a good app,but they need to add some more features to it like copy schedule and some other good features.;1
Nice;1
I would like to buy the program, but I do wish to use a different address.;1
Excellent;1
Good app but I can't get it to shade in the entire timeframes of my activities like in the photos here. It only has a line at the end time.;1
Love love love this app... but you guys can add some more features to make it a bit more easier to use..;1
Good app;1
This is seriously good and so far it has worked flawlessly. Just that, sometimes, it takes a bit of time to update the calendar entry on the app. But i don't mind.;1
"Good app and so close to what i was looking for, but it's missing one thing. If you could add an option to add your own tasks WITHOUT it having to be an actual event that'd be awesome. I don't want to add ""wake up"" or ""gym"" as an event in my calendar.";1
I'd say it's great;1
Good visualisation. Would be great if the widget came in a dark version as well and transparency could be set.;1
This is a good apps. But I think it will be better if the widget will show in the lockscreen too. So it will be easier to check the plan. But offer all this is a good apps. Still find no problem up till now. Maybe I'll try the premium version to see the more features.;1
it Is A Nice Application;1
Annoying that you can't change the color background of the dial with the free version but otherwise very useful and fun to use;1
Seems good for people who use a calendar already, but I hate Google calenders and Outlook alike. I couldn't figure out how to create my schedule without using one of those terrible calendars so I uninstalled.;1
Really nicely made and very useful app and always a looker for others! Recently however, it always shows some phantom alarm clocks I did not set...;1
Wish for larger text. Difficult to read.;1
Really great, but no project-task relationships that i could find. So grouping things is hard except coloring them manually;1
This is good application for the procrastinators who usually wasted their time on phone without any reason. I like the sectograph because it let me push to do the work of hat makes any sense. So I recommend you to use this application 🤗;1
I like the graphic;1
Useful but still needs more integration to Outlook ... I'd like to load my colour categories that I already have in outlook calendar in my visualization. Calendar by week numbers is also a must have ... I'd like to know also the percentage of availability of each day based on my events. It could also integrate with my alarm in order to know at what time I wake up ... and so on. The potential of this app is huge;1
Very good app. The only note is that it takes a while to make it syncronizing properly. But after you get it, works like a charm.;1
Very cool app for keeping track of your tasks and schedule;1
I like the app/ widget, i wish the center was a lil bigger or bold. I havent had an issue withit, other than that.;1
It takes some getting used to but then when you start thinking of it as an analog watch it sort of works.;1
Really like it. Would love to be able to manually resize appointments and add new appointments into arcs with free time.;1
Enjoying it so far;1
Cute, love it but bugs, no alarms that's the only thing keeping it from being 5 stars for me.;1
Good Android widget: 👉For watching planned schedules everytime at ease on the home screen. 👉 For syncing all calenders to view birthdays & events at one place.;1
I really like this app I find the the way it presents the data in a clock face with countdowns to your EVENTS very useful. The one drawback for me is that it doesn't integrate with Google Tasks or Reminders. This means that everything you want to see needs to be created as an event. This is not a massive deal but I do like the convenience of tasks over events. The widget sometimes loses synchronisation with the clock and shows a different time than the actual time.;1
Just please add reminders / notifications with custom sound 🔊 and more colors 😊 and please make the wedge /icon display description of the event or auto degrease the letters size to fit more than 1 word or add a fieldnto type title that will be shown/edited in the app even it comes from another planner without titles. 🙄;1
Love it just need galaxy watch face even paid (fair price);1
Great App;1
Excellent work;1
Best app. Works perfect but giving 4 stars due to colour settings, whenever you try to change colour of tasks there is a problem that you touch a colour and it selects other colour like touch red colour it selects blue. This problem is in all colours.;1
This is a great app, but i dun like it link to my calendar, because it will mess them up. Prefer if this is a standalone calendar, so that i can separate my schedule in this app, and other schedule in my calendar;1
Functional;1
Excelente programa, me ha ayudado muchísimo y puedo ver de forma gráfica todo lo que debo hacer en el día.;1
If u make an app for samsung gear , I would love that.;1
Classic;1
Quite helpful for daily tasks;1
A bird's eye view to your schedule.;1
It's nice and helpful;1
Excellent planner;1
App is great overall, but unless I'm missing something obvious I can't seem to put the widget on my home screen?;1
Its very good.;1
How to make the sectograph appear in the home screen;1
The app is real good and helps in improving the productivity! An improvement that could be made is to hasten the sync up with the calendar. It is taking quite a long time to reflect in the sectrograph after adding any new event!;1
Nice app;1
Great app to track your daily schedule. One thing what would be great to have here - displaying the scheduled reminders from google calendar. Unfortunately I do not see them.;1
Very effective. I would give 5 stars ,but writting space too little. Larger writting space will help much better.;1
Really fun view of your day. Still figuring out how to use it well. It would be nice for the widget palette to also be visible inside the app but it's not a huge issue. I could easily see myself changing to 5 stars once I get used to it.;1
Good app;1
It is a good app, really ok, but I don't like that, you oblige me to rate. This is a no go...;1
Nice app. Quite original;1
It gives a nice visual look at the day.;1
Update: changed to 5/5 for quick response. Will try the fix. Thank you! Great app. Using paid version. 4/5 stars only because the time sometimes lags behind the system clock. I have to open the app so that the times sync. Any ideas on how to fix?;1
Life-changing, if you use the app right it can very much help you like no other app I've found so far! I have to say a big thank you to the developers, you have no idea how much you've helped me and my family in a time of crisis by just something as simple as this although I do wish there was an option in the app so that the notifications worked like alarms because I have to use a separate app to do that because notifications are so timid. Actually truly life-changing thank you;1
Perfect. Only option I would like to have extra is the possibility to see the schedule clock on the screen of the phone before unlocking it in order to have it accessible with just one click;1
Love the functionality and the customizability! I used the watchface all the time on my wearOS watch. Only thing I wish for is the ability to use it on my new Samsung watch. Would pay alot for that feauture;1
I like the app ....no complaint, but I think it would be kool if you could change a particular event by rotating it on the clock ..instead of only doing it manually;1
Best app I have found in ages, it's easy to use and works very well for visual time management.;1
Great app! No ads and does just what it says on the tin!!!;1
Have an amazing experience and to simple to use but when I relogin to app after my phones complete reset its not getting my backup from the server plz fix this;1
A very intelligent timetable app with amazing design. Totally recommended.;1
Very cute design and easy to use, no app, i feel very satisfying.;1
Best app to manage my time, Seeing the size of my tasks helps my mind Be sure that it can do it;1
Very useful. Brilliant idea and elegantly executed.;1
Great concept to display to do list on a watch;1
Glad I stumbled across this app. I don't change my home screen often (maybe once a year), but this one app convinced me to rearrange the whole screen to accommodate its widget, and I'm glad I did! The way the scheduling interfaces with the clock in the widget is something that should have been thought of a long time ago. Edit: I forgot to mention the watch face and app. I have used the same watch face now for 2 years. This app replaced my Pear watch face and I haven't looked back!;1
Ok, I definitely need to edit my previous review. This is EXACTLY what I've been looking for in a watchface. Able to integrate my work and personal calendars into a fantastic integration of your watch and agenda. Easy to read, customizable, and honestly just perfect for those on a schedule. Can't believe i couldn't get the app to work on my watch when i first purchased the Pro version. Thanks for the quick response to my earlier review! Top notch developer!;1
Very easy & friendly app interface 👍;1
Very useful and beautiful app. Highly recommend;1
I usually don't review the apps I use, but this app most certainly deserves it! I have found this app to be a wonderful visual way to help me organize my schedule and my daily tasks. I believe it is the most versatile way to be reminded of the pending things that need to be done, beyond a simple schedule or task organizer, and the fact that it can be shown as a widget on my home screen is the real deal! Besides, it is extremely user-friendly and straightforward to use! My utmost recommendations;1
Still working on this app. Trying to use time blocking to make my retired life more organized. This is perfect for time blocking rather than scheduling all of your tasks and when you don't get everything done, feeling bad. You can look at your day and visualize your time blocks and your schedule and more easily see if you are keeping to your goals for spending your time on the things that matter to you.;1
Super. I changed my whole daily routine and myself, really!!!;1
I put this app on my tablet I share with my daughters and it helps me teach them how to understand time blocks. We both get reminders of the schedule we are on (play time, lunch time, movie time, pick up time) and they learn to recognize the colors on the widget with the ones on the clock we have. My daughter loves watching it to tell me what we are doing next.;1
Outstanding, the stock connectivity with various time based applications is perfect and the 5 button layout on the widget is customizable and should be called the 9 button layout! This feature alone is worth the price of admission! Granular controls allow for rich and diverse personalization. My only issue is the app came out in 2013 and I was not on it earlier!!;1
1st: Great concept. Except for the fact that nothing is showing up. It's just a blank clock no matter how much forward I skip. No matter how many times I close the app in hopes of refreshing. None of my events even show up on the widget. Deleting. 2nd: Deleted and redownloaded. It works now.;1
Absolutely great for neurodivergent people who need visual aids to feel oriented in time. I organized mine to show big color coded blocks of time for morning, afternoon, evening, night, and bed time. I love the 24 hour mode. This app helps me feel calm and centered.;1
This app seems small but it's a full blown package app that's I always felt missing from every calendar app. The app seems simple but yet powerful and really beautiful, having this app widget in home screen you don't have to open calendar anymore. What else you need? Two thumbs up to the developers for this neat idea, please don't break the app :);1
Beautiful and customizable app. Synchronization with calendars works flawlessly. Love the design. The widget is awesome, I keep it on my home screen. No ads whatsoever, in my experience. I may buy the premium just to support the devs, even though the free version has everything you need.;1
Helps me alot with daily work and sets a time to time pie of what needs to be done , therefore helping people to begin a routine. Best part it syncs with Google Calendar, you can change colours of sections, make it a home screen widget, change opacity of the widget, etc. Must try this app to keep track of daily schedule.;1
Best time planning app I've used! I struggle to keep tasks in order and know how much of my time they will take up. This app has all the features I need, and while I've only used it for a week, it has definitely increased my productivity. 10/10 I recommend to everyone.;1
I thought I'd like it. I like it more than I thought I would. Seeing appointments and meetings on a clock face is extremely intuitive, and having a widget that can show it on the home screen is a real boon. Fully recommended.;1
Really useful app for planning your day.;1
It was good because: -It had the time in form of a clock -It told you the time before a session -It told you the time each session lasts But since I dont have premium, it doesn't let me choose different colors, which is not too bad. Yet, i would like that option for free.;1
This initially looks a bit confusing. However, this design actually functions extremely well. The way it can act as both a clock, date, alarm and agenda widget at the same time is just incredibly efficient. It also provides you with a very easy way to evaluate at which times of the day you have events and more importantly: when you have breaks and how long they are. All this at a glance, compared to clunky agenda widgets where you have to sit and calculate it in your head. Well worth the money!;1
"The app is really great and don't even need the paid version. Unlike what people said, I found it quite easy to set up. I wish the ""custom repeat"" had option to choose which day of the week and not the frequency of days, as my schedule varies (schema as : 4 days A followed by 3 days B). I really love the widget option also. I just downloaded it but if I keep using it then I will consider buying the pro version to support the creators.";1
One of the best apps I have. Quick and easy to use, just update your Google calendar and your events and meetings show up in a clear way right on your home screen. Fantastic!!;1
I'm basically lazy. This has helped me get myself into a routine somewhat. Works like a charm. And stares right into my face everytime I open (the widget) so I don't miss a thing. Great work. 👍;1
It's awesome! I love that you can put it on the home screen as a widget and change the size. I didn't realize that in order to put something on the spectrograph you HAVE to use your phone calendar but that's ok. Really great quality and it's free!;1
Fantastic and flexible app!;1
This app is fantastic! I work from home anyway, and with the disruption due to the Coronavirus, it was difficult to maintain my usual schedule. By the end of the day, I hadn't accomplished much and really didn't know where the time had gone. I downloaded Sectograph and it has made all the difference. I am getting my work done and even have free time to enjoy. I even recommended it on Twitter yesterday.;1
The app is really awesome Just one suggestion: If you could add an alarm notification prior to the events occuring then that would make it absolutely unmatchable I would like to add more suggestions just be in touch would sure share my experience;1
This is the App I never knew I needed. I got the free version because it sparked my interest and upgraded to the full paid version within a day. Maybe I'm wired to see my day in the way they present it or maybe Sectograph is wired to appeal to me, I'm not sure. Either way their widget is the top half of my home screen and I am more in touch with my schedule than I ever have been.;1
brilliant! I absolutely adore this app. so easy to set up, makes using google calendar for agendas even easier than just using google calendars! the events on the clock face just clicked instantly for me, the fact that they can be colour coded is delightful. the widget is great, and even shortcuts from there can be personalised. I got the pro version even though the free one does everything you need it to. having 24 hour option is good though, and even more colour customisation now. LOVE it!!;1
This app is the perfect command central. I was just looking for a visual clock, but this is so much more! It is so nice to have an app that automatically syncs with my calendar so I don't have to manually put things in. The interface is super user friendly and the widget is incredibly customizable. I love how clean it looks and how I can customize the buttons to include all my productivity apps in one place.;1
1/ I'm very happy I paid for the app - I've used if for a couple years continuously now, and it has never let me down. 2/ This layout is excellent for taking my days schedule in at a glance. I highly reccomend trying it. 3/ The widget has pride of place on my homescreen, and my Android Wear watchface. The designer has done an incredible job of cramming all the important information into the widget, without confusing or overly cluttering the display. There are many useful customisations that I found easy to control.;1
Really great. It takes some time to get it working - my current use is to input what i plan to do the previous day either at night or through the day when i discover what needs to be done. Jotting down your plans is more effective than you might think to productivity. Ill keep using it and get back when i discover more tips to be more productive.;1
I originally doubted how this would help me. But decided to try it & see exactly it was meant to do For me, he most useful thing is it fits my daily schedule into a 4×4 size widget. Using a small % of my screen. + the way it's organized, just a quick glance & I see what's happening for the whole day. Way more efficient than digging thru my calendar app. I use a month calendar widget, but don't want to make a 2nd large agenda widget. This solved the problem perfectly!;1
Great app. Me as starter to better work day planning it super how I see now how bad I planed time. Now is with app things going better and better. Very suitable for work task sprints.;1
Good visualization of your day planning/schedule synchronized with Google Calendar. Great for time management and motivation. It is much more clearly in 24-h mode, when you see all your time, including sleeping. Three customized buttons give you access to you preferred apps from this widget. Customized colours and opacity. I'm satisfied.;1
I like it. What I would really like to be able to do with it is to set it on my homepage to where as soon as I open my phone my schedule is right there in place of my clock. Food for thought 😁. Thanks! Edit: wow! Thanks! Developer responded to my query within hours. Changed from 4 to 5 ☆☆☆☆☆!!!!;1
Wonderful enough to save your day from wasting .. An appointment organizer with alerts and setting priority can leave an hour shortcut with the times you specified on it on the main screen ... interesting .. useful .. and I loved it❤️;1
I really enjoy this app. This app looks very nice. And it forced me to learn google calendar. Now I use both this app and calendar every day.;1
Nice interface and easy to learn UX, good for keep your day on plan because it will help you to show what to do few hours ahead;1
This app is amazing. I can keep track of my day and connect my work and personal calendar an see them displayed them in a very colorful presentation. Never schedule two th I'll ngs at the dame time again.;1
I enjoy using this app! It does help me keep to my schedule and I usually get everything just about done. The more I use it the more I stick to my schedule.;1
Awesome app, better than any other planner. Work by time. Amazing! Thank U all!!!;1
Amazing app. Makes my phone look very unique and it's not just about the looks it is extremely useful as well. I am using it since a week and my productivity has increased like anything. Thanks a lot to developers for making such an amazing app. I use the paid version.;1
Really Impressed..! I was really looking for something like this. Thanks to the Team 👍 But, I wish the pro version price was a bit low then I would really buy the pro version too.;1
"Super easy to use. Helps keep track of ""white space"" on the calendar (Army reference).";1
Enjoying this app. Simple & easy to use. Visual didplay helps me to stay clear on commitments & time constraints;1
An amazing app, helped me to become more productive and disciplined. Only downside is is that I wish it was compatible with my laptop so that I can always be reminded of my time schedule. Other than that, an amazing app. Would totally recommend this!;1
Cool lil thang. You gotta get used to the controls but it is helpful when you're consistent.;1
I can use it for free and its the most convenient because of that. But i wonder if i can also see the time i spent for hours in a month (for each category or tags that i havent yet find the feature in here), it would be marvellous if i can do so. Maybe it exists in pro version?;1
Amazing app. I've used a paper calendar my whole life. This visualization and app sold me on going to an online calendar.;1
It comes as a widget on my phone so I can make it really big or put is small in the corner as a reminder. It's really useful!;1
Usually don't keep widgets like this for long, but live this one. Helps me see my work schedule at a glance. Also looks awesome.;1
Once I figured out how the graph worked, it was easy to jot things down. I wasn't confused about how it worked.;1
Love it!! So quick and easy to use and so stylish. Now I just need to find a watch that can run this on my wrist ❤️;1
I got this mainly for my smartwatch, as a way to keep in front of me a picture of my day, not for detailed navigation but for self-orientation at a glance. I especially like seeing the entire 24-hour day at once.;1
This kind of chart planner is created to be colourful and is totally clear for us to accomplish our daily task .It s was interesting to have this tool with me so that i can focus on my job accordingly with time. thank you. It s good tool for everyone without paying a penny .;1
This app helps greatly with organizing your schedule and keeping you on time. I absolutely enjoy using it.;1
Started using this about a year ago and it quickly became a fixture on my home screen. It functions about as you would expect out of the box, which is nice because navigating the customization leaves a little to be desired.;1
Amazing idea and super clean user interface. Everything links seamlessly to my other applications and helps get things organized for my day. I definitely recommend this app to keep track of how your busy day with appointments and meetings are going!;1
I love the beauty and usefulness of this app and widget. Deep diving into the settings make this app highly configurable.;1
I like that I can see at a glance my next events. The application is customizable and it also has sensible defaults.;1
A unique way to see your whole day and better plan it! Most visual tool I ever used, thanks!;1
Handy visual aid! Highly recommend as a tool for managing time blindness for ADHD.;1
This app is 👍 for overall productivity its clock like rotational view is perfect for wick glances and staying on track. However, this feature seems to be great for those with executive functioning issues, difficulty switching tasks, and/or time blindness.;1
A nice application with a interface designed to have the ability to give you a reminder, heads-up for coming events. It seamlessly absorbed info from my calander, alarm clock and prayers(Salah) reminder. Keep up the good work;1
Innovative and excellent UI... Shows a lot on information in a small space, very understandably!;1
Thank you for such a great app! Was wondering though if it were possible to sync also calendar reminders from Google calendar and not just events;1
I consider myself lucky. Cuz I found this app. Just explore the app and you will never let it go. The attention to detail in the app and the widget is awesome.;1
This is a fantastic app to schedule my day. Thanks. Bought the pro version immediately. But if developed for Always on display, it will be very useful. Anyways, very productive time scheduling app.;1
Widget offers the perfect interface for time management and it integrates a number of calendars seamlessly.;1
Awesome! The layout of your time is done aesthetically and with elglagently presented information;1
Great widget! Please, allow to save custom theme and make some presets for different backgrounds: dark/white + red/green/blue + transperent/not to start off. Changing bg forces to build another custom all over again to fit.;1
Awesome app but it kept losing sync with my work calendar which uses Office 365. Hope it gets fixed one day.;1
Good app. Shows the commitments for a day at a glance. Makes it easier to plan my day.;1
Loved this app. Helped me to enhance my output to the utmost.;1
Absolutely love this app. Very helpful for my daily planning. Recommend it!;1
Clean and simple view of my day - absolutely amazing tool for keeping me focused. Wish I'd found it sooner.;1
I love this app!! I'm a grad student, a new mom and works full time. This app really keeps me on track and helps me visualize the time I have for my daily to do list.;1
It works perfectly for me and I am loving it. I would appreciate it more if you guys could add weather support on the widget. By that it can replace my Home Weather/Time widget and I could ise only this widget for my Time, Tasks and weather.;1
This is the App ive been looking for. It syncs with my calendar and has a cool widget that you can personalize. 😊;1
I love the UI and how it puts calendar events together with time.;1
İntuitive and straightforward approach to calendar.;1
This is one cool app. Not only is it useful but it also has an aesthetically pleading footprint.;1
Thanks a lot team.... Amazing customer service and response. Amazing app. Would recommend everyone.;1
The best scheduling app I've used so far. Easy to view at a glance, and connects directly to your calendar. No complaints.;1
Great app, scheduler. Helps me keep on with routine aswell as any healthy habbits;1
Excellent, really makes it possible to see entire calendar on one page;1
Very clear and easy to use app. The paid version is so worth it. Having your daily schedule displayed on a clock is SO nice for my ADHD;1
Thank You for making such an amazing app...;1
Very helpful for me to visualise my schedule It boost up my motivation and efficiency 🔥🔥🔥;1
Good;1
Good;1
Nice concept;1
Wow....super app....thanx for this app😍😍;1
Perfect. Only option I would like to have extra is the possibility to see the schedule clock on the screen of the phone before unlocking it in order to have it accessible with just one click;1
Very cute design and easy to use, no app, i feel very satisfying.;1
nice visualization for my daily schedule;1
Magnifique👌;1
Nice, Interesting, Innovative UI.;1
Life-changing, if you use the app right it can very much help you like no other app I've found so far! I have to say a big thank you to the developers, you have no idea how much you've helped me and my family in a time of crisis by just something as simple as this although I do wish there was an option in the app so that the notifications worked like alarms because I have to use a separate app to do that because notifications are so timid. Actually truly life-changing thank you;1
Update: changed to 5/5 for quick response. Will try the fix. Thank you! Great app. Using paid version. 4/5 stars only because the time sometimes lags behind the system clock. I have to open the app so that the times sync. Any ideas on how to fix?;1
"Tối rất hài lòng về ứng dụng. Nếu sau 1 tuần tôi dùng thấy ok thì tôi sẽ nâng cấp lên bản trả phí coi như ủng hộ các bạn";1
Love the functionality and the customizability! I used the watchface all the time on my wearOS watch. Only thing I wish for is the ability to use it on my new Samsung watch. Would pay alot for that feauture;1
Good;1
Good app;1
5 stars*;1
Excellent;1
Good;1
Very nice;1
Look no alternative, This iS the Best PERIOD!;1

Really useful app for planning your day.;1
Very easy & friendly app interface 👍;1
Real great;1
Fantastic and flexible app!;1
Give a visual of whole day... Thanks Google team 👍;1
Love this app!! ^_^;1
Great app! No ads and does just what it says on the tin!!!;1
Very useful and beautiful app. Highly recommend;1
A novel approach to timekeeping that totally works. Effective and elegant. The best face for my smartwatch. BUT for me personally, it is always upside-down on my wrist. Can a feature be added to allow it to be rotated 180°??;1
Cool;1
Nice app;1
Really helping me to organise my time;1
Very good aap;1
Great apps for time management;1
A very intelligent timetable app with amazing design. Totally recommended.;1
Good visual representation;1
Good;1
Best app to manage my time, Seeing the size of my tasks helps my mind Be sure that it can do it;1
There are innumerable calendar apps, but this is not just another calendar app. This is an original, innovative and very useful window into your day's appointments. You can see the next few hours at a glance on your home screen. Top marks for both creativity and practicallity. Oh, and the developer actually replies to your queries! UPDATE after 3 years: this app is still unique and so useful that I can no longer do without it on my phone. __ And I just figured out how to add Exchange Work accounts: when adding account in Android settings, do not use the Work account button, but the Gmail button labelled with Exchange. The calendars will then appear on Sectograph like regular Gmail calendars! __ SUGGESTION: My feedback on alarms. I like having a marker for the alarm, but I think this should only apply to clock alarms, not to calendar notifications. These, in my opinion, are intrusive rather than useful. I just want to see when the appointment and not the notification is due. Thank you!;1
Great,i use it for my study shedule. I am so happy.;1
Great concept to display to do list on a watch;1
Have an amazing experience and to simple to use but when I relogin to app after my phones complete reset its not getting my backup from the server plz fix this;1

Great idea of an app!;1
Good.;1
I like the app ....no complaint, but I think it would be kool if you could change a particular event by rotating it on the clock ..instead of only doing it manually;1
nicee;1
Expecting something kinda better. I must right a review after using. Countdown starts from now.;1
Good app;1
Awesome app;1
Haven't had it for long but it's already changing the way I see my day.;1
Simply revolutionary!;1
Owsome;1
It is very useful to remind things and keep them sheduled...;1
Love it;1
Ok;1
Aweosome;1
I'm so like this app. Because this app so helping me in my work✨;1
Super. I changed my whole daily routine and myself, really!!!;1
Very good for priority planning!;1
Best app I have found in ages, it's easy to use and works very well for visual time management.;1
I want it;1
Just what I needed.;1
Beautiful app;1
Thanks a lot team.... Amazing customer service and response. Amazing app. Would recommend everyone.;1
Muito bom;1
İntuitive and straightforward approach to calendar.;1
Very useful. Brilliant idea and elegantly executed.;1
Excellent app. my routine is now in motion;1
ITS G R E A T. I LOVE THIS APP.;1
better presentation of my busy day;1
Just awesome;1
Being a visual person seeing my day in this perspective is extremely beneficial for my time management challenges.;1
Beyond expetation;1
Absolutely great for neurodivergent people who need visual aids to feel oriented in time. I organized mine to show big color coded blocks of time for morning, afternoon, evening, night, and bed time. I love the 24 hour mode. This app helps me feel calm and centered.;1
Worth it! Definitely helps make streamlining your day easier. You're either planning to win or planning to fail.;1
Love the dial presentation!;1
Excellent app for time management;1
I love the UI and how it puts calendar events together with time.;1
I love pies. Why not make my daily schedule one! Easy to use and links to existing calendars.;1
Everything can be customized. I am absolutely satisfied.;1
I consider myself lucky. Cuz I found this app. Just explore the app and you will never let it go. The attention to detail in the app and the widget is awesome.;1
Nice app;1
I really love this app 👍;1
Excellent idea;1
Best tool for time management..;1
Awesome app, better than any other planner. Work by time. Amazing! Thank U all!!!;1
Really easy way to see my whole day graphically laid out.;1
Very effective for people who have a habit of planning and living a life with discipline;1
Nice interface and easy to learn UX, good for keep your day on plan because it will help you to show what to do few hours ahead;1
Great;1
Handy visual aid! Highly recommend as a tool for managing time blindness for ADHD.;1
I thought I'd like it. I like it more than I thought I would. Seeing appointments and meetings on a clock face is extremely intuitive, and having a widget that can show it on the home screen is a real boon. Fully recommended.;1
Pretty awesome. Working great on a pixel 4 xl.;1
Ok app;1
This is one of the best apps, one of the best features is that it announces the activity name...... Edit: Hi, the app was doing well! And was planning to buy the paid version. But i am getting errors with background tasks not refreshing, and today due to that error, i lost all the events scheduled which were scheduled for today. Can you advise please?;0
I love the app but I'm probably going to have to uninstall it. Its had a problem lately where the notification will not go off. No matter how many times I push close or silence the sound keeps playing. It's becoming annoying.;0
I loved this app so much after I downloaded it and used it for about 2 weeks. Because I loved it so much I decided to purchase the pro full version and payed £4.99. However, it was not worth paying at all. I would have rather used the free version with the ads. I will recommend everyone to download the app and use the free version but dont get the £4.99 ad free version because it doesn't really give you anything extra. I would recommend the creator of the app to add more features for payed.;0
I have the app set to verbally remind me of schedule events. The problem comes when I have my phone set to silent. The app supercedes the phone and still verbally reminds me. If the phone is on silent, it's for a reason. There seems no way to bypass this. This is a SEVERE flaw that needs to be addressed, hopefully sooner rather than later.;0
I paid for the premium to save my data to upload to my new phone. Didn't work, deleted ALL of my info and when I reached out to tech. support, no response...;0
The tutorial looks simple and a good layout but when I make an entry 9 out of 10 times it disappears and I need to re-enter it. Half the time dosent work;0
It literally just completely stopped working yesterday, without me changing anything either in the app or in my settings. Whenever I add a new event or routine now it just doesn't create it or show me notifications, my schedule stays completely blank. Lmao I'm sorry but it doesn't even bring up the technical report when I press it;0
Try to make the app more automated, i have been following every steps but still it shows no notifications or alarm on time;0
I paid for premium but I did not get any notification or upgradation. Still the app is showing the purchase premium option. Feeling disappointed.;0
Dear developer I am the paid user of application. No notification sound is coming. Please see the issue urgently.;0
too many ads and require to pay for applications that are commonly found in play store.;0
This app noticification sound didnt work...always silent and vibration ...i done everything;0
I bought the pro version yesterday and today in the morning it's asking me to purchase again ... Contacted the developer and if no answer is received within 12 hours, I'm reporting this app for fraud.;0
Only notifications pop out no sound at all;0
I would not give a star also bcoz the thing is it should have more function....Next time when i download the app ....it should be a good app..... TROUBLE SHOOTING..^_^^_^^_^^_^(^^):-[:-[:-[;0
its wonderful app but thete is something much important missing CHECK LIST it should have check box so you can tick mark after doing it And this should also reflect in week summary so that YOU KNOW HOW MANY DAYS YOU MISS THAT TASK;0
Uninstalled within 10 minutes of confusion. What to set where. Not user friendly. Not able to set routines daily programmes. Very confusing settings.;0
I have autism and downloaded this at to help with my daily habits and routine. Used it for less than 5 minutes, couldn't make heads or tails of it. The instructions given apon installing were more confusing than helpful, terrible layout.;0
I'd like to give it a 5 star, VERY MUCH. The app is very useful, convenient and easy to use and what's even better is that it allows the user to modify the alarm (sound, icon, etc) as we please that makes it much easier to organize our schedule. But the app no longer works after i've changed my phone, i don't know if the issue is about my phone (i used Mi A1 before and oppo currently) or the app. I've read about the configuration to get the app back to work but to no avail, please help. Ty;0
This app started out great. Everything was so organized and I was happy I had a digital schedule with reminders to carry with me. But it stopped giving me notifications, it also stopped showing my reminders all together. I wanted to uninstall the app for a while because it's never working, but today was the last straw. I had a reminder put for my midterm, but of course since it's such an awful app... it didn't notify me. I missed my midterm. Screw this app, don't download it.;0
"this app isn't optimized for use, it's just a concept. for example, the alarm plays music but can't be shut off. there's no ""acknowledge alarm"" so if it starts paying music... yeah it never stops. this is only one of many bugs so bad it breaks the app. don't waste your time.";0
Not easy to use also not effective;0
Why this app requires so much of settings in one time.. 1)Like it should be in recent apps..2) If internet is off it doesn't works..3) Even though all the permissions to app is allowed in phone settings.. Than to it crashes.. It requires an immediate update with all the bugs fixed soon. Or people wouldn't even write a review.. They would uninstall the app and find better alternatives.;0
Free options are hard to find and bundled with pro version, can't open free without ad for pro version literally clicked one thing after opening your app for the first time and it instantly went to a pop up of the pro version, I'm not going to navigate your app to find only the free options that are given to me bundled in with the pro versions when there are other apps that are available that never mention pro version which I downloaded;0
"Cant even get past the first screen. I get a notice that my phone is blocking the app, but there are no instructions in the troubleshooting for my pixel, I've looked all over my settings, there's nothing I can find to change to ""allow"" this app to do something. Frankly I'm dubious that this app somehow needs some extreme level of permissions that no other ever has, especially as it hasnt told me why.";0
If you want to use it properly, you have to pay for the Pro version. It is not user-friendly.;0
WORST APP EVER! Because there is no reminder bell things, I think there is but it DOESN'T WORK! I can't even remember that I have this app! With reminder thing will be better. I SPENT TWO HOURS TO WRITE MY ROUTINE PLAN, AND I THOUGHT THERE IS REMINDER! IT'S NOT EASY TO USE THIS APP TOO! I AM DELETING THIS USELESS APP IMMEDIATELY! ALARM DOESN'T WORK AT ALL!! HOW DISAPPOINTING. 😠😠;0
Does not refresh on Samsung phones. I have done every troubleshooting step and more, to no avail.;0
Awful, it has timing issues , when I reach the end of the day , it leaves an empty task and u cant delete it.;0
Not working properly , don't delete immediately any routines ,;0
Programmer does nog work properly. It is changing times and dates on his own. Instead of saving time it is costing me time (and money for the pro version). I ran into this problem a few days after my purchase so i'm not able to get a refund while the app is unreliable, so practically unusuable.;0
The app would be nice if it actually gave you a tutorial on how it should be used. It seems almost like clickbait, with one appealing look and then it's not what you expected or needed. Yes it's very organized and but nothing is explained.;0
The idea is great, and I would have loved this. However I WILL NOT pay to be able to use different routines for different days. This app is nothing more than a way for them to trap you into payment. Don't bother with this one.;0
To me its not user friendly. I dont like the question up front before a tour of the app. Its very limited unless you pay for the pro version. I think, when picking a routine or something a bar or something should pop up with options or ideas to choose from.;0
New update has ruined the app...the reminder option is no longer available with ringtones...why the heck should I keep this app now in my phone... deleting....;0
"Pop up stating "" the app has been blocked by the system. Please authorize the app in your device settings. Troubleshooting or refresh background tasks "" is flashing on my device. May I know what is this about?";0
The new version is too complicated to use and I could not find any directions. However, a application with a easier use will be my preference.;0
"I missed my work today because of your stupid ""weak alarm"" method. This means I've lost some money. Notification reliability should be of paramount importance. If something doesn't work 100%, remove it. Very disappointed. VERY! Edit: I didn't get any warning, nothing. If the other option is the recommended one (which I hate that it adds an alarm icon in the status bar. other apps work without doing this), it doesn't mean the other one IS NOT WORKING. Bad. I'm forced to use the stock alarm for the first event in the morning to be sure, which is very inconvenient";0
Bought the pro version, amount got deducted and programer version became accessible. But after sometime its showing that i have to buy the pro version again. Kindly troubleshoot this problem.;0
bogus app. update isnt working. i was using the same app in past in the same device it was working properly. now i hv updated and its not giving any notification and even status bar is showing the past activities not current.;0
not very user friendly, atleast for me. the alarm doesnt ring it on only vibrates. i have to put every thing manually, like if its 11 am in the clock it gives me optionts what i m going to do from 12 pm. and even after using it for a week i am not clear how dis format gonna helm me;0
i hated that you cannot edit certain things. For example when you go to make a schedule there's no option to delete blank slots, no obvious anyway.;0
The layout was horrible, the events and the scheduled items don't sync.;0
Awful the concept is great but it is not user friendly and super annoying I deleted it as soon as I downloaded it;0
The new version is so complicated loved the old one it was simple and easy and quick to use it was perfect;0
Asking to buy pro version when clicked on new program;0
app looks good but does not notify me on my oppo. i foloowed the instructions to fix this however they are outdated so i cannot fix this problem.;0
The tutorial doesn't help and shows you nothing the app is very bad and isn't easy to understand I have given up after wasting time trying to figure this trash out. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.;0
Very disappointed about the recent update, I had everything work fine till the update scrambled everything.;0
The widget doesn't work, it appears only few minutes and then it disappears so I need to add ot manually again;0
Looks great, alarms don't work. The notifications just don't work on my Motorola G7 plus running Android 9.;0
Its most timewasting app instead! I downloaded this for schedule n it asks to buy a pro version for it! It should be mentioned first before we dwnld this app!;0
Hard to understand setup. Could not schedule tasks to weekdays. Does not even show a calendar .;0
Didn't like navigation menu location update;0
All the features are premium 😐;0
Bought the premium version long ago but now it has ad on it.;0
I've bought the pro version and after a week it disappeared. disappointing;0
Don't know how to use it because many icon were showing to upgrade to new version popups.;0
some thing is comming in front if screen and interepting. app is not runs in notification bar;0
The one thing that made this app better than the others was that it was ad free. Uninstalling.;0
It was to difficult and takes a lot of time to create a routine;0
Hi have been looking for a app which remind me each and every hour because I'm a student and I need a that kind of app but in your application this feature is not available... 😒😒😔;0
bad, the reminders not working many times trouble shooting;0
Can't buy pro version on note 9? Apparently in app billing is not available on my device? Guess I can't give you my money...;0
Too difficult to figure out how to set up, can't add times to daily routines. This app is a waste of space.;0
Not user friendly at all, they definitely need to work on the user experience.;0
I am unable to download this app.. everytime I click install it just doesn't download it;0
Doesn't let me add even one item to my day without buying the pro version.;0
It will ruin your plan, you are going to waste your time customizing it. Downloading this app will increase your screen time and degrade your efficiency.;0
"""removed support for google drive backups""";0
Way to confusing to use the tutorial didnt help at all;0
It's notification tune is frequency low;0
why you changed layout to old one..its really bad and annoying.;0
This app has started to give me full screen pop up ads;0
I got just scam. Rs. 200 for pro version. Nothing happened. Good times.😒;0
not easy to use....always begging to buy pro version.;0
Oohh im very hardly managing it and its a disgusting app just a waste of time. Also it is not uninstalling.;0
Play tune does not work on gionee;0
what is the use of this app if it can not show notification with sound, also can not alert me when i m buzy in others chaos.;0
i really didn't understand the interface and its too complicated ...;0
wont synch to calendar, have to buy pro version;0
sir i already did all step but i still face notification ringing problem.;0
Interface is not really satisfactory;0
I buy pro version but it features are not given to me;0
there is no time table,this app is fake!;0
Not very user friendly. Uninstalled immediately;0
can't do anything unless you buy the pro version;0
way to confusing to do something simple;0
not work in my tab Lenovo yoga 3 bed experience 😑😒😞;0
I think it is like a time table box like structure (just like diaries) from inside but nope ☹️;0
the User Interface makes no sense;0
I don't know anything can anyone help me;0
this app sucks;0
I was unable to understand anything..... This app is a big mess;0
has something wrong it takes the routine i created for one day and do it for all days;0
This app is to complicated;0
It is very awkward cauz you need to give it a proper plan;0
Most of the things are paid;0
Premium version only;0
Its good but too rigid.. Add option to start the routine from a speicifc place as we wish... Say we wake up late.. I want to start the routine late instead of just going late at the old routine. .. Add a button for that please;0
Very bakawas;0
Not so good;0
I think it is like a time table box like structure (just like diaries) from inside but nope ☹️;0
Good and fast;0
its wonderful app but thete is something much important missing CHECK LIST it should have check box so you can tick mark after doing it And this should also reflect in week summary so that YOU KNOW HOW MANY DAYS YOU MISS THAT TASK;0

This app has started to give me full screen pop up ads;0
I buy pro version but it features are not given to me;0
Couldn't figure out.;0
Bekar app at all !;0
Too difficult to figure out how to set up, can't add times to daily routines. This app is a waste of space.;0
Hello. The app keeps disappearing from my notifications. I already allowed notification access and persistent notification on my settings. I also whitelisted the app on my battery saver but it still doesn't work. Help please 🙏;0
It was to difficult and takes a lot of time to create a routine;0
Very bad app;0
hard to use;0
Not user friendly at all, they definitely need to work on the user experience.;0
Terrible;0
Very bad;0
Oohh im very hardly managing it and its a disgusting app just a waste of time. Also it is not uninstalling.;0
Nic;0
Not really functional;0
bad, the reminders not working many times trouble shooting;0
Way to confusing to use the tutorial didnt help at all;0
"Cant even get past the first screen. I get a notice that my phone is blocking the app, but there are no instructions in the troubleshooting for my pixel, I've looked all over my settings, there's nothing I can find to change to ""allow"" this app to do something. Frankly I'm dubious that this app somehow needs some extreme level of permissions that no other ever has, especially as it hasnt told me why.";0
WORST APP EVER! Because there is no reminder bell things, I think there is but it DOESN'T WORK! I can't even remember that I have this app! With reminder thing will be better. I SPENT TWO HOURS TO WRITE MY ROUTINE PLAN, AND I THOUGHT THERE IS REMINDER! IT'S NOT EASY TO USE THIS APP TOO! I AM DELETING THIS USELESS APP IMMEDIATELY! ALARM DOESN'T WORK AT ALL!! HOW DISAPPOINTING. 😠😠;0
Bad;0
bad;0
em app ra bai ardham ai sasthaledhu;0
sobad;0
worst app doesn't work;0
worst app waste of time;0
i really didn't understand the interface and its too complicated ...;0
way to confusing to do something simple;0
Looks great, alarms don't work. The notifications just don't work on my Motorola G7 plus running Android 9.;0
the User Interface makes no sense;0
not good worst app;0
app looks good but does not notify me on my oppo. i foloowed the instructions to fix this however they are outdated so i cannot fix this problem.;0
"I came back to this app a go three times over the last 2 years because I really wanted it to work. Each time I tried, I spent a couple of hours trying to navigate around the features and failed to get anything out of it. Incredibly unintuitive, no in app explanation, and the online ""getting started page"" doesn't explain much on what each features do. Edit: Thank you developer for the reply, it shows that you care. I wish you all the best in making the improvements, the idea behind the app is honestly good.";0
Very good app, but it would be perfect if the app actually didn't shut down and not give me notifications. PLEASE FIX THIS;0
My phone keeps blocking the apps action no matter what I do. It keep showing it was blocked, troubleshoot, and refresh background task.;0
I installed and then uninstalled it. Unless I am mistaken, there is no way to edit day-by-day deviations from a routine. So I can set up a routine, but then have no way to track how well I followed it, day by day (for instance, exercised for half an hour instead of an hour, or started late, or missed it completely, or did things out of order). Am I missing something?;0
You must plan in resuming the reminder tab. It's really important. By the way, I'm a paid user.;0
(edit) Been using it for a while occasionally and every time it feels like a hassle to find what I need to reach within the app.. I only use the routines, no events or reminders, I have a separate app for that, Google Assistant wit a calendar. To add a change to one day it requires a lot of clicking to amend it.. I end up writing down the rest of the day tasks on paper, deleting, amending the times and adding them manually with the new times.. That's counterproductive. I need an easy way to move;0
It is a good idea, but it's not really easy to use.. in fact it's quite complicated :/ I bought premium because they advertised I could set schedules per day, and I can, but not how I had hoped. I recommend to make it simpler by allowing the user to toggle days per schedule in the routine editor, and additionally make any small changes in each individual day.;0
EDIT: Even just an option for the horizontal interface would be great! Thank you for taking my review into consideration! Please please please! Bring back the old horizontal interface. Or at least have an option for it. I used to absolutely love this app and would have rated it 5 stars anyday. But now I find it quite useless.. I understand how it could work for some people but it's definitely not working for everyone (as I've seen in other reviews).;0
I've only just started using it and can already tell it has potential. It has a simple UI but very confusing features with next to no instruction on how the features work. I purchased the premium version with the hopes to organise my routines to suit my shift work. But I can't find a way to automatically alternate my routine cycles (if it's even possible), starting the following routine cycle when the previous ends;0
App is good but the programmer feature is bad. I have created multiple small routines which i want to enable from programmer based on my work meetings for different days. So if I have late meetings on Wed and Fri, I want to enable a separate set of routines for these days. Similarly for weekends. The programmer is allowing for just dates which is not the feature that I bought the pro version for. I want small, reusable routines that I can configure from programmer for days not periods of dates.;0
So it's good. I payed for pro but the issue I'm having is adding my routine to my timeline because whenever I try and add it, it takes me to edit my routine. It's really annoying because I'd like my routine in one clean place. If this is fixed I'd definitely rate it 4 stars;0
Great at first but now it's getting on my nerves. I tried to create a routine for each day of the week. Today is Monday, and for some reason, my Monday routine shows up for tomorrow, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. I've had daily routines show up on other days over the past week as well. There seems to be a setting where I can change this, but that doesn't seem to do the trick. It shouldn't be this hard to have one daily routine for each day of the week. Uninstalled.;0
I would love this app only if the notifications work at all. There were no alarms or notifications or pop ups showing in my Oppo F5. I tried tinkering with the system like what was said in the troubleshooting page so may times, yet nothing worked. Would give 5 if I do not have this issue.;0
I like the way it's present itself but advantage if your not getting any notification ring ......in the system I allowed everything I needed too but still it's not working out;0
"I was recommended this app by a friend who loves it. I got the premium version as I expected it to have better features. This app is very confusing to use. I even went to the ""help"" section and was even more confused. I'm very disappointed";0
The minimum timer is 5 mins so useless for me. I had hoped to use this as an exercise timer (I need alternating time countdowns running consecutively e.g. 3m/30s, 3m/1m, 5m/1m) plus a reminder for when my favorite combat sports are on TV. I'll keep looking.;0
Reminders should not be transfered in event section. It was better before to figure out events and remiders separatly.;0
Very bad app. I organised all of my activities, took me 1 hour to complete my planner, then realised that the app automatically sets the time at am, so all my afternoon activities where at the morning, for example if I had to eat at 1pm it said that I had to eat at 1am, so I changed them to pm and suddenly the app errased my whole schedule. WASTING 1 HOUR;0
Doesn't able to back up on Google drive;0
I've spent hours on it already and I'm just not getting it. Looks like most tutorials are for an older version. Can't figure out how to create shorter than 7 day Routines, what's the difference between a Routine and an Event, etc.;0
Android keep blocking the app from sending notifications, I've re-downloaded it and put an exception for it in the battery settings to work without interruption but nothing happens ! FIX IT.;0
Nothing special. just a calendar app. not worth the time it takes to set up. clunky at best. poor layout. minimal instructions. not intuitive to use;0
App cannot keep track of an atypical. Everytime I set the day one it just resets after day 5 back to day one. instead of skipping two days and then 2 day 1 like a normal week would work. I'm deleting this app for sure.;0
This app is being killed in the background whatever i do. I have given all the permissions. But still it is being killed. My phone is oppo A5. Please do something Devs.;0
Clunky, complicated, and confusing. Not streamlined. Ugly color choice for non pro. Just a disappointment.;0
Fair enough for ads but now the widget isn't showing anything anymore, it's just blank. I've set up all events and schedule and it's still blank.;0
Not very easy to use. You can figure it out after you play with it long enough, but over all, not very intuitive.;0
Limited unless you buy the full version. I spent time looking around trying to work with the app. A lot of things I tried wanted me to upgrade, which is why I found another.... I feel my review is fair. Sorry.;0
Would agree that it isnt very user friendly. Functions seem complicated and too basic at the same time;0
This app is really very good, but notifications aren't working. I tried everything it told me to do but it's still not working.;0
Please update the app, i want to use the app, but After a day ,alarm is not ringing , i think this app have too much bugs and problems;0
useless I dont want to purchase the app as this free version offers no good features.. the paid app might be better..Rating 2 just because of the feedback on user review.;0
yeah, this is not user-friendly. there should be some kind of tutorial, this is not the kind of app you can just jump in and start using, which is what I was hoping for.;0
i had added a routine & by default it took a date almost 8 days ahead from today's date... i m unable to change the date... it's frustrating...;0
"I would give this app 5 stars, but if you press ""silence notifications,"" you can never turn them back on.";0
statistical data for daily routine and check marks for completed or missed routines are expected;0
How to use this app? 🤔 Very bad experience. Please simplify the process. Nobody wants to take a extra tutorials to use your app to plan our day.;0
Annoying to set up. You'd think it would be easy to have the exact same same schedule just 30 min later.;0
This tune can make alarm? I set a few alarm is not ringing..;0
It is better if don't have Buy pro version, hoping an app free offline soon .;0
I was trying out the routine trick. I set the times and dates, but it just wouldn't work. Please help.;0
The most recent update just made it harder to move times around.;0
Crashes at start.;0
Useless and time consuming. Got pro version but no option for refund;0
the free version is pretty minimal.;0
there ia no way to go back to the routine old interface? new is ugly;0
Really weird formatting? I'm trying to be MORE organized not get a brain workout trying to figure out an app;0
osm app but now its update an I am not able to see my all reminders that I use to remind my self before uninstalling the app;0
Not working notification.;0
calendar sync for a productivity app is a pro only feature;0
you basically can't do anything if you don't buy the full version.;0
Useless without pro.;0
Everything I wanted it for I had to do the pro mode;0
cant move the tasks up or down;0
how to do so the link is not opening only;0
Im still getting accustomed i like the simplicity;0
im sure the app is nice, but i cannot add a routine, or any activity, nor i can delete anything?;0
Not so usefull;0
It was okay could be better;0
Has potential but made no sense I didn't know what the hell I was doing needs more explanation and help;0
I'm so confused and frustrated trying to figure this app out.;0
It's hard to understand how it works;0
It's kinda bad sorry;0
If u want to study you need to plan DON'T USE APPS;0
Genuinely not a good app.;0
Don't like the new changes.;0
I didn't know how to do anything..;0
how to use bakwas i am vrry an gry;0
i got no notification;0
good not bad;0
It's just okay.;0
What I didn't know I was looking for. Hate planning my day on the calendar, and tried to use 90 different to-do lists to schedule my day. Update : their new change combining calendar events with reminders doesn't work for me. I only use this for talking reminders no scheduling;0
Worst;0
Good;0
Beneficial to get my goal. It's heplful to make discipline and commitments to yourself,it's continually popping up notification that what you have decided according to your time table, over all its Good and helpful for students..!!;0
okayish;0
good;0
The new interface is cluttered and hard to use. Edited, in response to the query below.  In the older interface, a routine had a separate page for each day of the week. Now it's a continuous scroll. The older approach seems cleaner.;0
"I've been trying to figure out how to have a custom time set for the ""add notification"" options, and there doesn't seem to be any way. For example, I need to set it to 1 hour and 30 minutes, but there's no option for that. We need the ability to enter exactly the number of minutes and hours we want, instead of only having presets.  EDIT: Now after using it for a while, the app has been plagued with reliability issues. It often is late with the notification by a few minutes, or the service completely stops and I'd have to restart the service. Due to this issue, I cannot rely on this app for anything that is time-sensitive because I'd end up being late for all my appointments and jobs. I've contacted the developer multiple times about this but so far they haven't been able to fix the issue.";0
not so easy. Perhaps Pro version may b good. uninstall.;0
Lots of In-app purchases ... Not worth the time .;0
It's too confusing.;0
Routines don't last forever any more;0
The new widget is not looking good. Please bring back the old widget or atleast bring an option to make it look like the older version.;0
You have to buy pro version;0
"Tried it out. The time function, which is 90% of the app IMHO, is clunky. The default ""end"" time is ""until next activity"", but then it automatically changes to the start time of the next activity and you can't change it back. Then, if you add a task that overlaps other start times, it deletes the other activities. I spent 15 minutes setting up a schedule and was frustrated to find that I had erased my entire afternoon schedule because I made a mistake when changing the end time of something mid-day. This app was, for me, ironically, a waste of time.";0
This app is a good idea and I like the fact that it is very good to start healthy habits an get organized but yet, I could not do anything even with the little tutorial at the beginning.  THIS APP WAS NO HELP TO ME ALL I RECOMMEND IS THAT THE APP HAS TO BE A BIT MORE SELF-EXPLANATORY I DID NOT KNOW HOW TO DO ANYTHING!!!!!!!!;0
So far I like it I thought there would be an option to sync your routine from the Google calendar but apparently you can only sync the timeline. The time tune staff has been very helpful and the app has alot of potential!;0
Reminder didnt work on Vivo;0
Everything is under pro version.;0
At first this app worked well, then the next day this app stopped notifying my next activities. It stucked on the last activity before the next day;0
Stopped working after a week;0
after recent update notifications messed up. sometimes i can't turn it off, so it rings until you reset the device;0

You have to buy pro version;0
The new widget is not looking good. Please bring back the old widget or atleast bring an option to make it look like the older version.;0
Okay so far as I have used, the app was pretty good. I read that this is s new one, and I like all the features present in it. However there is still lot of room for improvement. I have a small suggestion to make, you could add a new feature that marks things to be done or followed and if not done it sets an overdue and in the end of the day it tells what are done and what are not. That way people will have something that looks out for them as they follow the Timetable :);1
I love how many options you have for setting notifications. My Fasting routine notifies me at the start, 30 mins before it ends, and when it ends. Very cool. The app is missing two pretty big features though. 1. The ability to see how your routines overlap. Right now it's completely unintuitive. You basically have to do math in your head to understand your schedule 2. An indication for what the current time is. Again, math in your head. A schedule is supposed to help you visualize your time;1
I like its simplicity and overall functionality. I've been using it for a while. I just purchased the pro version to promote support to developer. Just a little favor, hopefully, we can see the events synced from Google calendars in Events tab and preview the events & routines for the days ahead. Thanks :);1
Hi I love this app, but something was really not good about this app. The App Permission thingy, I thought it was automatic but not. I don't know how to possibly fix it but please fix it or help me to fix it. Actually I already turn on the App Permission and This app was allowed but still it says it was Blocked by the System. Hurry Please, I don't want to waste my time anymore.;1
I really like this app for my phone. My favorite part is the voice notification. It really helps with my kids homeschooling. I set the voice to tell them that its time for school and to sit at the table, then it plays a little song. I love this because now when they hear this they turnoff their morning cartoons, put their dishes in the sink, grab their notebooks then sit at the table. I love that I don't have to keep tell them to get to the table anymore. The only thing I would suggest is having the option to make my schedule on the computer too and be able to link the two devises. Like how google does with their calendar app. Other than that I really like this app.;1
This is my first time using a scbedule app and I love it so far! However, I'm a little bit confused on how it's supposed to work: I'm able to set up routines for everyday instead for single days in a week? I'm asking this, because when I made my routines for Monady, everything went smoothly, but when the next day comes, my routines aren't showing up at my schedule anymore. Do i have to set up the routines for EACH DAY, for my routines to be at the schedule, or is there a better option?;1
"New to the app, but it looks very useful based on what I've seen thus far. I'm looking for an option we're saved routines can be implemented into the daily schedule, but are also tied to a kind of countdown timer that corresponds to the specific routine added (e.g., impromptu select ""laundry"" and it's automatically integrated/layered onto present schedule w/ a countdown clock allowing for whatever amount of time you preset for that routine). If it had/has that, then it's five stars for me.";1
One of the cleanest UI's I might have ever used. I understand that the app is made for us to be able to stick to our schedules! But I think it's a shame they're not letting us double it's use as a time log too! I think the statistics can be made more informative like graphical representations and stuff. And we should also be given an option to just log in our schedules day after day without using the routines function because I have different schedules everyday!;1
This app was quite useful to have and something I think that I needed. The only thing that put me off was the 'premium '. It slightly ruins it so I would definitely make everything accessible to everyone if I would change something about this app. Other than that, quite handy little app that will probably make a difference to your day!;1
I just started using this. One thing I would like to see is the ability to add check boxes to an event. For example I have a time slot labeled housework scheduled from 11am to 12pm. I would like to be able to tap on that block of time and see that I need to do dishes, vaccume, and dust in that time frame, and be able to mark off each task as it is complete.;1
Best and cleanest scheduling app I've found by far. It has it all: multiple schedules repeating on custom intervals, visually effective tags, comments visible on table and notifications, widget, statistics, events, dark theme. All without adding unnecessary noise. Using it is extremely intuitive. Doesn't lock any significant features behind premium wall, instead they're just extras that are nice to have (which is a rarity). But one thing that's missing is the ability to copy events/activities.;1
Great app! I use TimeTune to time block my entire day into short segments. A few fixes: [ when scheduling a day in advance, the time auto-sets to 24 hours (ending next day). If I scheduled breakfast from 8:00 AM to 8:30 AM, it automatically sets to 830 AM the next day. Very tedious to change.] [difficult to see overlapping tasks] [no easy way to push an entire schedule back, if you are late on one item, and need to push everything by 10 min for example. You have to change each manually.];1
This is a great app, highly recommended. Im not sure if it has a monthly routine option pls do tell about it. Also I would like to know if the data saved can be linked to a user account, so if I change device I can continue using my routine/schedule without adding all over again. Thanks.;1
Love it! Gave it a 2nd try and it really helped me stay on track with my routine. Such intuitive tools and functions. The only problem is that it keeps malfunctioning and doesn't update notifs or even the widget;1
Very useful but in my case i didnt hear a costum sound even though the voice and vibration work, also if i try to pick a song its usually start but the notification didnt do the same and im already check all the troubleshoot. is it because costum sound cant use music?;1
Only just started using this app. Looks good but it would be great to have a calender view so that you can easily see what's coming up in the month. Edit: I will go as far as to say that I will end up deleting this app, even though I already paid for it, if there isn't a calender view added eventually.;1
Its been super helpful during this homeschooling process however sometimes the notifcation sound just keeps going and the only way to shut it off is to stop what im doing and go into the app itself. It wont let me remove it from my notifications during these times either. Its not everytime just sometimes.;1
Troubleshooting problem. Unable to notify events on time. If these problems are sorted this application is very useful. Best for people who want a timetable application that is simple and easy to use.;1
I loved the app, its unreal!! The only reason i give it four stars is because i would add a section with to do list opcions for the tasks that doesn't have an specific time!!! Do that and i'll give you five stars;1
I really liked this app. This helps me remember things on time but the only problem is that, it doesn't give Pop up or notification sound so every time I've to check my next task.;1
Good and most practical application. But if app's widget could show date, day and current task and next task only or With customization option like that... This would be just awesome...;1
Amazing app! It easily allows you to manage routines and plan your day. The only thing I would add is the ability to write tasks and then have the ability to add them to the schedule.;1
"Everything is up to mark. Just the feature ""persistent notification"" sometimes doesn't show up. I would request the timetune maintainers to please check this. Otherwise, I love this app! ❤";1
I love the prev. version having exactly timeline view of task instead of this congested box view. plz. keep it optional and revise/improve the repeated task within the day. And the remaining star is yours.;1
This app is great!!! From a students perspective I love how you can make different schedules, like one for this and one for that. It's so easy and user friendly, I ❤ it. One thing they should add is a way that I can access this app with my schedules on both my phone and tablet without having to copy out the entire schedule again. ⭐⭐⭐⭐;1
This app is super useful to keep me scheduled. I only have the free version, but it's still really useful. I like how it looks and how I can look at how much time I put into certain activities. I also like how I can set multiple notifications for the same activity. You can also change each individual notification however you want. The app is very user friendly. I would definitely recommend 👍;1
Update: It would make more sense to have the schedule tab as just the schedule layed out where you have the time of day scale to the left ( editable show just hours or hours and minutes) and then the activity from the routine/s at the correct time. And the only way to edit the routine could be only through the routine tab (as thats where I assume you want the main part to edit routines to be). But I love how you can save different routines for each day. Not to sure what programmer is for?;1
This is the app I've been looking for but there's still room for improvement. First off, when setting the default notification to x amount of minutes before, it would make most sense to also have a notification the moment it actually happens, or at least have the option to do so without having to do it manually for every single entry. Second there is a lack of flexibility. There should be a way to easily move around and resize items on your schedule without changing the routines themselves.;1
Amazing app, really organized, I do think the app should be a little bit more colourful and have a more minimalist design.. and should stop shutting down in the background after like 5 hours;1
I understand the function of the switch. What I meant is that once I had attended to a reminder, I could delete it so that I could remain with a clean slate for future use. Now, combining events and reminders makes it hard to have a clean slate at the beginning of each day cause you can't delete recurring events. I just want reminders tab that's separate from events so that I can always clean my reminders up at the end of each day and know which ones need to be done the next. The app was so elaborate when events and reminders were separate functions.;1
I will like one more option in settings -> calendar sync -> [checkbox] push events to google calendar ... I know it's not good to receive notifications from two places but on galaxy phones always on display shows only events that are listed in google calendar or samsung calendar app and I really like my schedule on always on display screen... please do it this will help all galaxy users.;1
This apps quite easy to use and looks simple. Just it doesn't really meet my requirements, it can be better if it got the calendar and tickbox. I've purchased it but it still like the same. It said sync to my calendar but it didn't shows what I've planned in my google calendar. The only thing I am satisfield is the notification sounds.;1
Have relied on this app for work since it 1st came out. Great for project management & tracking/budgeting time. REQUESTS: • Please bring back hourly repeat function (i.e. Set an event to repeat every 3 hours). It was a useful Interval timer. • CHROME EXTENSION or online version (as paid user, I'd pay more for this). • Increase maximum # of days for atypical routines, with option to create monthly routines. • Sync Google tasks & reminders (in addition to events). 2-way sync w/Google Thanks!;1
it's good for now, but i wish there was a way of crossing out the tasks or things i've already done. and also to be able to put tags when it's not a routine;1
Great for daily planning. simple and clutter free interface. Good to use.;1
Have found app to be quite helpful. Aids in developing routine and good habit patterns. Beneficial for developing personal discipline.;1
Really good app for organizing your daily routines, definitely worth getting. Wish simultaneous activities were better displayed, though!;1
The background is very bland, you could have more colors. I also noticed that the app keeps crashing;1
Developer responded to my issue quickly and politely. App is pretty good so far, maybe a little more clarity is needed about the user interface for dummies like me :) Like an arrow to indicate I can swipe for the rest of my schedule.;1
I think the app really helps you stay organized. It really helped me out. The only complaint I have it that you have to pay for the premium version but I mean... how else are you supposed to be able to make money off of an app so...;1
It's great! Really been helping me keep tract of time and doing school work. The only problem I'm having is having a notification sound. I get a notification, but there's no sound and I don't notice it. My sound is turned all the way up and I haven't silenced them.;1
Good apps, make my life is better. But, why I can't use ringtone as notification ? I can only use vibration for notification.;1
A really awsm app to make and maintain a schedule. It really helps a lot in time management.;1
I love this app and the idea behind it with the weekly and daily routines. I wish I could view my month or week at a glance however so I can see my weekly routine and how my non reoccurring events affect and lay out with my routine.;1
The app really nice.....i request that the voice notification should be made more clearer and voice should be like dominating that can make orders;1
Nice app It helps a lot to save time. You will understand where you used more time and where you should spend more time.;1
It's really a good app to track your daily routine and set reminders but i will be more satisfied if it gets upgrade to a more better look and more tracking options...;1
I miss the old lay out of lines instead of squares on the daily calendar... Now it feels like Google calendar wish they gave the option of choosing the display layout.;1
It's a nice app with a simple interface. The widget is also very useful. However, I think it lacks a daily or weekly to do list.;1
It was really helpful to keep track of what I have to do everyday. I think that it is easy to use and it could be even better one day;1
Very easy to make new routines and activities if you want to organize your time a little better;1
It was wonderful but if you put checkboxes it would be better;1
It's good but i think it would be better if the routines could be sorted;1
Even after buying it displays ads and says it is a free version.... After some time it is working ( got an technical support too from the app manufacturer Tq);1
Fantastic app, would be nice if it had a calendar feature though.;1
Nice app but online synchronization and cloud connection is required in case we miss the phone, its very important today.;1
This app is great so far. But I wish there was an option to select several days at a time for each routine.. if there is already pls let me know.;1
"Great app with widget some more. But i wish can add in ""all day event"". So that i can include daily task.";1
Really beneficial, it allows me to follow my routines efficiently;1
love the app,any chance we'll be getting an iOS version of it too? and be able to sync everything across all devices (maybe even a desktop version of the app);1
A great app but i miss a overview of week activity's, the app get confusing to use after adding some tasks;1
Fine app. Would be perfect to have desktop web version also, to make adding routine much easier.;1
Easy to use and very useful especially spending lots of time at home at the moment;1
Very useful app, and some understandable problems with notifications.;1
Very useful app for routine planning. Loved it 👍;1
It's simply the best for time allocation to activities and routines.;1
Not upto the mark but its okay. Ads give ptoblem and ui is little weak.;1
Good app and really helpful with time management and staying organized;1
Absolutely love this app. So much productivity.;1
The alarm sound doesn't work, so i could not know it already the time...;1
How do you decrease the timing of the alarm??My only question😃;1
Hi I really enjoy and appreciate this app. As a mobile app it works perfectly for me, however I'd really appreciate a computer version that can sync with it. I'm not sure if this exists already? I like that the app is on my phone so that i can constantly check my schedule anywhere - any time, however when I feel the need to adapt and change my schedule, it feels a little cluttered and time consuming. I frequently feel the urge to open it up on my computer as it is easier to work with this interface given the larger screen and increased capability. Please consider this in future upgrades, Regards,;1
Simple and nice. Can add up little more;1
The only schedule app I undrstood..easy to use;1
Honestly a really good app for creating routines. However, I'd like to see a calendar view of my routines and be able to view more than the 2 weeks in the Schedule Tab. The Programmer Tab is one of my favorites! Last thing I would like is to have Activities overlap each other when creating routines. Instead of splitting the long Activity when another Activity is set to times within it.;1
Make some more widgets, rest all app is nice and user-friendly;1
New update made me little bitter(in routine section ) ,kindly take it back and give the old one. In the routine section , first the app allowed me to edit the routine of daily easily and separately , but now all the days are one by one and not side by side , actually side by side is best and easy to edit , thank you for your reply :-).... Before it was as free but now as constant ad is placed below which is so annoying.;1
Great app..but one suggestion..if you could add the feature of marking whether or not we followed a particular activity in the routine..that would be great.Like if I've planned to study..I can mark whether or not I actually studied.and then it could show the statistics of how much I stuck with my routine.please consider it.also you could add a goal tracker..Love your app.;1
I miss the timer function, please put it back. Reply to Developer's suggestion for a new pomodoro timer: Unless it's markedly better than the hundreds of timer apps available in the store and at a more competitive price, I wouldn't consider a new timer app from you. As it stands now, I've held back from upgrading to the revamped version on one of my phones as it takes away functions including the timer, a feature that makes the old app stand out and superior to the deluge of other similar apps;1
This app is very useful for students and other works;1
I would have given it 5 stars but after latest update 3.0, it takes some time to load. Example, earlier when I wanted to change any block, it would be instant editing. But now I have to wait for sometime for it to load.;1
Good app and prompt support.;1
What I miss: Option to edit singular block from a routine (e.g. clear or move a routine block if an event for a given day overlaps without pausing the routine) Otherwise great. An implementation of the mentioned feature is a surefire way to make me buy pro.;1
This app is amazing it has (mostly) all the nessary tools.Though to make this even better you can include a timer. An include it on your wallpaper , otherwise it is a really good app for everyone;1
I like it very much it is very good and easy to use;1
Great app! I suggest a timer on this one, so we can still track our rest periods every time we take a short rest.;1
I wish I could donate in exchange.for getting rid of the ad at the bottom.;1
I want to make a weekly habit (routine), but there's not any option to choose the name of the week's and plan! please add that option (instead of day 1, day 2 add: Sunday, Monday) and a option to choose first day of the week. thanks.;1
Good app but it needs more work. I gave it four stars because its missing a premium selection, that is an overview of your activities so one can see total time spent on what. This could be in a form of a pie, bar, or line chart. You can include all so we have a choice. With this anyone can now keep track of time spent on a daily activity and limit time spent on said activity. So far good work work guys.;1
I really like this app. The concept of blocking your times is great and I find it helps me structure my time really well. It's also a load off of my mind knowing that I don't need to think about when to eat or what time to check my email because I am at ease knowing it's all planned for and I will be informed accordingly. My only disappointment, with the service and not the app, is that I am unable to structure my timeline online on a PC. I think there are limitations of the mobile device that makes the scheduling somewhat confusing. I think it will be perfect to incorporate a way to set up your schedule on a nice large screen and use your phone for viewing and notifications.;1
This app for students are xawesome but the thing I don't like is that there is no tracker. I can't see the what I did in the last week. Other wise the various options for alarm and the stickers are perfect.........;1
I want to say just add on the feature to check the box/things which i have done from my daily time boxing schedule;1
Great app! The app offers very interesting and unique features as well . But there is only one problem for people like myself. I spend most of my time doing some work on my laptop, and I try as much as I can to ignore my cellphone whilst working. If only I could manipulate and change my schedule in TimeTune accordingly on my laptop or pc it would be perfect.;1
Great app and I want to import my calendar so that I can replace my calendar widget with it, but I cant buy the pro version. I tapped purchase once to see the price, then hit cancel in the google pay modal. Now whenever I tap to buy it I get a modal saying that in app purchases are not enabled on this device. Google Play Services is installed and works normally with other apps (and worked fine the first time I tapped to buy).;1
Well I like having an agenda where, if needed, I can be reminded of what I need to do. However, I am not liking how after 3-5 days of reminders, it just stops doing it and I have to go in in order to refresh. At this point a normal calendar app preinstalled would be better, since I can set it to remind me every day. Could this be fixed?;1
Great for maintaining and keeping a routine. This is detailed enough to develop any kind of daily/weekly/monthly routine, and flexible enough to incorporate out-of-routine events and distractions if you use it right. It is a bit tedious for some people, (that's why the 4 stars) but they can keep it simple and high-level if they like. But, if you really want to tame that beast called your work week, school agenda, or personal days like me, this will take care of it.;1
"Really helpful app. I've looked at lots of other schedule apps, but this one is the easiest for me to customize precisely. Great for making routines! Since a few of my routines overlap, it would be amazing if there were an option to see routine titles in the widget timeline above or before the task, in order to keep an overview of which/whose routine is in effect. Both of my children have their own different weekly routines, so it would be nice to see on the timeline, that for example, it's kid#1 who has school on Monday mornings and kid#2 on Monday afternoon instead of two ""time for school"" tasks with no specifics. It would also be great if this app could be accessible from my computer desktop or if I could sync with other family members.";1
After installing and uninstalling several other apps I finally found this one and it suits my needs the best. I like the appearance and all the features. There are two things I'm missing however - subtasks and the possibility to tick off every single completed task or event for the specific day. This would make this app a perfect tool for me and I wouldn't mind to pay for it. As a busy mom battling depression I need a simple tool to help me to organise my day and week, and to remember my tasks.;1
Excellent so far. Better to include a feature to tick off tasks as a record that it was completed.;1
What I miss: Option to edit singular block from a routine (e.g. clear or move a routine block if an event for a given day overlaps without pausing the routine) Otherwise great. An implementation of the mentioned feature is a surefire way to make me buy pro.;1

Latest update don't have button for 'OK' or 'DONE'... It's good for people, especially students who are busy with their schedules..;1
Hi. I love the application. I am planning to buy the pro version. I'm just wondering if the pro version is a one time life time already;1

Absolutely love this app. So much productivity.;1
Please just add alarm and its good easy to use the app;1
Okay so far as I have used, the app was pretty good. I read that this is s new one, and I like all the features present in it. However there is still lot of room for improvement. I have a small suggestion to make, you could add a new feature that marks things to be done or followed and if not done it sets an overdue and in the end of the day it tells what are done and what are not. That way people will have something that looks out for them as they follow the Timetable :);1
Good;1
I like it very much it is very good and easy to use;1
Add More icon please;1
Hi I love this app, but something was really not good about this app. The App Permission thingy, I thought it was automatic but not. I don't know how to possibly fix it but please fix it or help me to fix it. Actually I already turn on the App Permission and This app was allowed but still it says it was Blocked by the System. Hurry Please, I don't want to waste my time anymore.;1
Have found app to be quite helpful. Aids in developing routine and good habit patterns. Beneficial for developing personal discipline.;1

I like its simplicity and overall functionality. I've been using it for a while. I just purchased the pro version to promote support to developer. Just a little favor, hopefully, we can see the events synced from Google calendars in Events tab and preview the events & routines for the days ahead. Thanks :);1
Very useful but in my case i didnt hear a costum sound even though the voice and vibration work, also if i try to pick a song its usually start but the notification didnt do the same and im already check all the troubleshoot. is it because costum sound cant use music?;1

"I like this app very much to create a schedule for everyday and having the reminders. Haven't found any other app which perfectly fits my requirement like TimeTune. But I am always facing the issue where I stop receiving the intimation and have to ""Refresh background apps"" which is very annoying. Hope I can receive support for this issue.";1

How to activate sound notification;1
Preety good;1
Very easy to make new routines and activities if you want to organize your time a little better;1
A really awsm app to make and maintain a schedule. It really helps a lot in time management.;1
The background is very bland, you could have more colors. I also noticed that the app keeps crashing;1
Meh;1
Best and cleanest scheduling app I've found by far. It has it all: multiple schedules repeating on custom intervals, visually effective tags, comments visible on table and notifications, widget, statistics, events, dark theme. All without adding unnecessary noise. Using it is extremely intuitive. Doesn't lock any significant features behind premium wall, instead they're just extras that are nice to have (which is a rarity). But one thing that's missing is the ability to copy events/activities.;1

Pretty good;1
I like this app, I am just unsure whether I can sync one profile on two devices. I dont want to purchase the pro version for both my devices and have to set up my different routines for each app.;1
They should make a website, that is in sync with your phone;1
Troubleshooting problem. Unable to notify events on time. If these problems are sorted this application is very useful. Best for people who want a timetable application that is simple and easy to use.;1
Hi , i use this app to manage my studying And it works very nice But if it had a calendar it would be excellent If you can , please add a nice calendar to the app, that it shows our tasks too  Thanks for your amazing app;1
very good app;1
I wish this app was available on ipad.;1
It's good but i think it would be better if the routines could be sorted;1
I like and Immediately boight the Pro;1
Mast hai bhai;1
I really like this app for my phone. My favorite part is the voice notification. It really helps with my kids homeschooling. I set the voice to tell them that its time for school and to sit at the table, then it plays a little song. I love this because now when they hear this they turnoff their morning cartoons, put their dishes in the sink, grab their notebooks then sit at the table. I love that I don't have to keep tell them to get to the table anymore. The only thing I would suggest is having the option to make my schedule on the computer too and be able to link the two devises. Like how google does with their calendar app. Other than that I really like this app.;1
I LOVE THIS APP, ITS VERY HELFUL FOR ME TO DO MY ROUTINE.;1
I wish I could donate in exchange.for getting rid of the ad at the bottom.;1
I just started using this. One thing I would like to see is the ability to add check boxes to an event. For example I have a time slot labeled housework scheduled from 11am to 12pm. I would like to be able to tap on that block of time and see that I need to do dishes, vaccume, and dust in that time frame, and be able to mark off each task as it is complete.;1
Amazing app, really organized, I do think the app should be a little bit more colourful and have a more minimalist design.. and should stop shutting down in the background after like 5 hours;1

So good;1
Gud;1
"Everything is up to mark. Just the feature ""persistent notification"" sometimes doesn't show up. I would request the timetune maintainers to please check this. Otherwise, I love this app! ❤";1
It was really helpful to keep track of what I have to do everyday. I think that it is easy to use and it could be even better one day;1
Realmente ayuda mucho, me sirvió bastante pero.. Parece haber un problema con las notificaciones sonoras, solo me avisa visualmente. Por eso lo califico como 4 estrellas;1
Only just started using this app. Looks good but it would be great to have a calender view so that you can easily see what's coming up in the month. Edit: I will go as far as to say that I will end up deleting this app, even though I already paid for it, if there isn't a calender view added eventually.;1
Very useful app for routine planning. Loved it 👍;1
love the app,any chance we'll be getting an iOS version of it too? and be able to sync everything across all devices (maybe even a desktop version of the app);1

Grt;1
I love how many options you have for setting notifications. My Fasting routine notifies me at the start, 30 mins before it ends, and when it ends. Very cool. The app is missing two pretty big features though. 1. The ability to see how your routines overlap. Right now it's completely unintuitive. You basically have to do math in your head to understand your schedule 2. An indication for what the current time is. Again, math in your head. A schedule is supposed to help you visualize your time;1
This app was quite useful to have and something I think that I needed. The only thing that put me off was the 'premium '. It slightly ruins it so I would definitely make everything accessible to everyone if I would change something about this app. Other than that, quite handy little app that will probably make a difference to your day!;1
Amazing app! It easily allows you to manage routines and plan your day. The only thing I would add is the ability to write tasks and then have the ability to add them to the schedule.;1
How do you decrease the timing of the alarm??My only question😃;1
Good;1
I really liked this app. This helps me remember things on time but the only problem is that, it doesn't give Pop up or notification sound so every time I've to check my next task.;1
very nice app, easy to use, the best organizer, to do, reminder. It's like having a complete pack with u. But only thing is you have to put some efforts and time in typing ur routines.;1
Its good;1
This is my first time using a scbedule app and I love it so far! However, I'm a little bit confused on how it's supposed to work: I'm able to set up routines for everyday instead for single days in a week? I'm asking this, because when I made my routines for Monady, everything went smoothly, but when the next day comes, my routines aren't showing up at my schedule anymore. Do i have to set up the routines for EACH DAY, for my routines to be at the schedule, or is there a better option?;1
Good;1
Its been super helpful during this homeschooling process however sometimes the notifcation sound just keeps going and the only way to shut it off is to stop what im doing and go into the app itself. It wont let me remove it from my notifications during these times either. Its not everytime just sometimes.;1
it's good for now, but i wish there was a way of crossing out the tasks or things i've already done. and also to be able to put tags when it's not a routine;1
The app really nice.....i request that the voice notification should be made more clearer and voice should be like dominating that can make orders;1
I loved the app, its unreal!! The only reason i give it four stars is because i would add a section with to do list opcions for the tasks that doesn't have an specific time!!! Do that and i'll give you five stars;1
Really beneficial, it allows me to follow my routines efficiently;1
The alarm sound doesn't work, so i could not know it already the time...;1
I miss the timer function, please put it back. Reply to Developer's suggestion for a new pomodoro timer: Unless it's markedly better than the hundreds of timer apps available in the store and at a more competitive price, I wouldn't consider a new timer app from you. As it stands now, I've held back from upgrading to the revamped version on one of my phones as it takes away functions including the timer, a feature that makes the old app stand out and superior to the deluge of other similar apps;1
Really good app for organizing your daily routines, definitely worth getting. Wish simultaneous activities were better displayed, though!;1
It's well put together. I think it works very well for that it's for and can help provide structure to your day. The next step for the app is to incorporate goals and goal metrics. Help me track if I'm getting 8 hours of sleep a night or studying 12 hours a week.;1
"Great app with widget some more. But i wish can add in ""all day event"". So that i can include daily task.";1
Not complete but nice;1
Even after buying it displays ads and says it is a free version.... After some time it is working ( got an technical support too from the app manufacturer Tq);1
I have been looking for the perfect schedule planning app, and I think I just found it! This app is perfect! It has different tags, events, and you can even add your daily/weekly routines! I can't describe how much I love this app. The best part is, everything is free! You can purchase the Pro Version, which I highly reccomend you do! Download NOW!;1
It was great at first, it really helped me get my stuff done. But now, every 2 or so days, it stops sending me notifications so I go and refresh the background tasks, it works again for a couple days but then it happens again. Could you please tell me how to fix this? Other than that it's a great app 💖 Edit: I fixed the problem, the app is perfect now;1
Great app for organization and seeing where your time goes. I love that they brought back having days on separate screens to swipe across. I bought the pro version to support this company for making the best time management app I've come across! Thank you timetune. Keep up the great work. Edit: I don't like that in the new update the statistics don't show the percentages of how much time you spend in one tag. Can you bring that back??;1
Thanks, amazing. Took a little while to figure out how routine worked with program, but I think I understand it now. Love how you can tweak everything and integrate it into the homescreen background. Love the icons in de bar as an option. Really useful, but non intrusive app. Good value for money. Would absolutely recommend it for anyone who thinks Google calander lacks a few functions or is really bad at organizing or routines.;1
This is a really great app! It helps so much and I don't miss my schedules now. It's simple and easy to use. I even love it's functions, just what I need! However, I gave only four stars because I found a single problem. The time schedules can only be for 24 hours and no more than that. I have tasks that go on for days, and I had to manually schedule it to all those days which is a little time consuming. Overall, this is good! Great work!;1
Super duper amazing app. I absolutely love that it notifies it at right time with a pop up window along with voice also. It's the perfect app I was looking for my study schedule. Thank you to the team for making such an efficient app. Also the pro version is very very affordable. Routine schedule is very flexible too, I can disable any one of the routine. Very commendable feature for me though.;1
Very nice app . It is helping me organize my work and follow a schedule. It has helped me to learn the value of time. I recommend this app to all those who want to stay well organized and follow everything time to time . I would like to say thank you to the app developers and the editors and everyone who helped create this app . Thank You;1
Following daily routine has kind of become cool since I've downloaded this app, it's THAT good. No complications, gives you exactly what you want and more with the colour and tag image options. And I am talking about the Free version here. Will buy the premium in future.;1
Love this app! Helps to keep organized! I go a thousand directions in a day and this app is great for helping me remember the little things! Easy to set up! Fun to customize! Great app!;1
Just the way I wanted. I searched and only found this one that organizes in such a clear and simple way. Free content is amazing, can't wait to try out the paid stuff. Will recommend to anyone.;1
Even though I am having problems with notifucations, causing me to reset, this app is amazing as it is so easy to use and it aesthetic. I love this app because it is so easy to change your timetable according to the easily changing life we live.;1
The absolute BEST of all time management/schedule apps I can find and have ever used. It is absolutely phenomenal for scheduling out your days/weeks and getting yourself into a routine and kept on track, as well as tracking your hours spent daily on certain tasks. 10/10, A+ app.;1
This is a great app to manage schedule. interface and otherthings are perfect. But I wish, the on-screen notification should be like the lock screen popup (card type) notification and other thing is about the widget interface. It's not bad but can be more attractive.;1
TimeTune is an AMAZING app. I honestly wouldn't change a single thing about it. I absolutely love and enjoy the app and its great features a lot. Truly one of the best apps I've had on my phone.;1
Enjoying it so far, can't wait to see future updates. I am using it as a supplement to my calendar app and it works perfectly. Bought the pro version immediately after installing the free version because I was so impressed with how functional it is.;1
This is my first app review ever, I felt the need to express how I feel about this app. TimeTune is a very awesome app, especially if you are looking for a way to develop routines in your life. It's very intuitive and flexible. Try it. You will love it.;1
I've been using it for more than a year now and it's great. My productivity has improved since I know exactly what I needs to be done and when. Been using the free version so far, because I didn't need the other features so far. But I'm really considering buying the full version;1
Great app. Suggestions : please add options to add tasks hourly. So, +1 to the previous task, could help. Now, most of the apps provide to type the time in chat itself, so selecting the time again manually in this is difficult.;1
Very good Easy and convenient to use, can be used in widget helps in displaying upcoming activities. Must have for those who plan many activities in a day and need to c their schedules regularly.;1
Great app, recommend to anyone who loves planning / organisation. The only fault is that it takes a while to set up but I understand that there isn't really a way that can be improved. Love it, keep it up!!;1
Perfect for my needs. I'm so disorganised and lose track of time easily. This is exactly what i need. The custom tags and voice notification are especially nice features.;1
Neat and clear on tuning your time. I have gone through couple apps with the same intention and prefer this app over many. Definitely helps you take out the randomness and to stick on time. Thank you for the developers;1
This is a fun and exceptional app for scheduling routine actions. You can also schedule non routine events too. If I had any quibbles, it's that it would be nice to make edits within the schedule for the day I'm on without having to adjust a whole saved routine day. Also, the emoji options could be more expansive (they're pretty good as it is, though). Otherwise, it's an excellent app!;1
Really good and super helpful. Because of Covid-19, there's a chance I won't be going to school for a couple months and I wanted an easy to follow routine to factor in my online courses for a minimum of 2 hours. Didn't do just that, but I was actually able to fit in all my chores with more than enough free time to spare. I really recommend the app, and will definitely be telling my friends!;1
Took it yesterday and it is exactly what I was looking for. If you have an idea of how you want to manage your time and need something to help you change your focus to the next thing in your plan so you won't lose track of time, this app will make everything much easier, being able even to overlap atypical routines to normal one. Only took pro version to support the good work as they already give all the necessary options in free version. ++ And it works great, no bugs, no major issues;1
I enjoy scheduling my day through this app and I like the notifications letting me know what's time for what! I know it's a simple reason but I need the discipline and this app has helped me :);1
Really a good app. It is perfect to set a daily schedule and you get notified on time.;1
Brilliant! the developers work hard to always improve an already brilliant resource. Well worth spending a little time and reading the get started and FAQ's.;1
Helo, first i used to not complete my works but when i downloaded this app i completed all my works in 1 day only actually my work takes 1 week but whenever I downloaded this app i completed it in 1 day only. Its so awesome app❤❤😀😁😉;1
Perfect for an office assistant and a personal assistant, comes with alarms and notification, set meetings for a whole week. Very good application;1
Such an awesome app♥️....one thing I would like to suggest is, please add some features like checklist and all, so it can show how much discipline I was as performance on graph.;1
One of the best time optimization apps to have ever been made... Been using it for about 2 years now... Just have one or 2 nitpicks.. a hold to drag option... and possibly a chrome extension of some kind for notification if possible... other than that... it's pretty top notch!!!;1
Really love the app. It's exactly what I was looking for.The only thing it's missing is a desktop version or website . That would be really helpful;1
Highly Recommended. Fits my needs, Easy to use App! I purchased the pro version to support the developers. Kudos! and Keep ot up!;1
I just downloaded this app and I can tell that it's very useful and user freindly, I used other apps to organize myself but this one takes the cake and on top of that the developers/owner of this app responds to issues or suggested features unlike other apps I've used, that's the main reason I think this app is great;1
Ayush, This app has helped me greatly in planning my to do list as a student. The energetic reminders are the beat part that force you to take up a work as soon as it rings. I highly recommed this app to people of all age who wish to manage their time or to those who have a great problem in following their schedule. Thankyou Time Tune Team;1
A great time organiser app. Only concern is please reduce price for the pro version so that it will be more willing to buy and then I will surely buy the Pro.;1
I like how easy is to create schedules for each day. Contains just the functions needed. Great app.;1
All are good. However a feature like block some apps at particular time , and another at other time according to schedule would be added. It will be great n will sure consider going pro!!;1
It is a perfect app for organizing the routine. It is easy to understand the settings and has many customization options.;1
I love this app beacuse it's so simple to use. It's also easy to follow the schedules that you plan in the app.;1
Very good UI and ux a little confusing at the start but overall 5 stars the part which was confusing is: adding routines and activities having a little tutorial would be nice;1
the best apps I use for personal schedule so far. the only thing is need to pay for no ads & sync with google calendar. however it doesn't a matter for me;1
"Have you heard of that saying, ""Where did the time go""? Well this app helps me stay on schedule with my day instead of it just disappearing with nothing accomplished. Love the interface and very user friendly.";1
Especially for working from home, helps to structure your day. Very helpful for a strong mental, and not to feel like you should be doing something all the time.;1
It took a while to find a great app, this is amazing, it really helps me with my schedule, I'm more organized than ever!!!;1
I tried many apps of time organization and none of than make me satisfied as this app.. It cleared my mind,easy to use, simple and so pratical.;1
Awesome app TBH.. seriously helped me a lot through my studies my daily routines to have time management in my life.. Kudos to Time tune app seriously very rarely you stumble upon a app Soo useful;1
"No, what I mean is, in the past it wasnt ""day 1"" instead monday tuesday wednesday and etc, but I'm fine with it being this way, I can adapt to the problem quickly. Nice job, this apps is worth the price, been using it for 2 years";1
Very good application from the viewpoint of a student. For me it helped a lot to stick to the routine, through alerts, and notifications, I've made. It's very easy to use and the facilities are best.;1
Love this app it's super great to manage your time and make the most of your day.. best thing for me about this app is the fact that it has pop-up notification to remind me of what I have to do! Love love LOVE IT!!;1
This app is awesome but it can be improved by adding some functionalities such as finish work option;1
LOVE IT. This app is the app I've always been looking for. It allows you to set a routine and add specific events.;1
LOVE LOVE LOVE its so perfect for what i need! 1.some more icons would be great if possible or even the ability to add our own image as an icon would be amazing! 2.i reccomended this to an ios user (who was very keen after i showed them)and they couldnt find it, if this hit apple products this app would be used by everyone thanks for making this because its not often you get a great UI, great graphics and such amazing functioning in an app :);1
Really I am saying that, this app has the best interface. I do not often rate any app but this app insisted me to rate it. Great work team.;1
This app has really helped me organize my schedule and block out my routines that don't fit into other time blocks and have smaller increments of type that are hard to see in other calendar apps. I would recommend using for morning and evening routines.;1
Really good for time management Also I'd like if there's an alarm option instead of notifications for each task cause sometimes my phone is silent and i miss important things;1
I love being able to see how much time I will spend on different tasks and then see what's left. It really helps me put things into perspective to make better decisions.;1
Experience after my time on this app, supper detailed, and incredibly smooth. The best part is how convenient the lay out is. My style and ways of doing things changed right after I hit the OPEN APP BUTTON!;1
This is a great app for planning a schedule. It notices me just when it needs to.;1
Your App schedule doesn't update in real time. Troubleshooting makes it work and then again same issue.;1
Very versatile app. Is a bit complex and takes some learning but once you know what you are doing, you can create very complex and customized schedules.;1
The best app to manage your time and notification of next scheduled work with voice assistant;1
I'm loving the User Interface of the app. Easy to use, simplified widget display, I don't think I even need the pro version. Perfect. Completely value adding.;1
Love the app. It's help me manage my time effectively. Easy to use and understand.;1
such a great app, so organized and clean. my favorite part that you can make your own tags! its make it way more satisfying. you should get the app for free!!!!!;1
Does exactly what it says. I don't know if there are ads but I haven't seen. good luck with future updates.;1
Great app! Helped me get my time optimized and scheduled. Thank you very much developers!(1 suggestion would be to add auto backup on the cloud through google and so on);1
I've been using this app for around 3 or 4 years now. It really helps to keep myself on track. Especially because I'm easily get distracted. The interface is very simple and easy to use.;1
Excellent app! Exactly what I was looking for in a day planner app.;1
TimeTune has made scheduling my tasks easy. I can edit my schedule whenever I want to and can keep track on my daily tasks. Thank you TimeTune😊👍;1
Great! Love this app, you can organise your timetable and clone events, you can have a weekly cycle, daily cycle or a odd day cycle. Love this!! Great aesthetics as well;1
Nice app... Good layout and design.. One request- Add tracking as well to the tasks.. then it will be complete solution Along with setting up tasks I need to track as well which tasks I have done today, weekwise and monthwise;1
Just one thing.. ads are a problem, otherwise.. amazing, love it.;1
I love this app... It has a perfect schedule for us.. like people like me who want to be scheduled but cant be organised... I will;1
Been using this for a long time, tremendous improvements from then up to now. Great job.!;1
Fantastic app I downloaded 2 apps for routine making 1. This and 2.app of 26 mb and you won't believe this is the best I think;1
Very easy to use the interface is very good and rookie;1
I really like how this app is working. It's easy to use and routines are very useful. I had little problem and I got a response in one hour, so thank you for the help!;1
Awesome app for daily routine planning. Easy to use and simple UI. I loved it ❤️.;1
The more I use this app the more I love it. I've been looking for something like this for a long time. One thing: I'd like to be able to sort my routines chronologically rather than alphabetically.;1
Very simple setup and gives you an idea of where you have time in your daily schedule.;1
Best app for accountability and Routine management, I just love it.. Also the widget is awesome.;1
It is very nice app. And it's really work. I love it his feature and system. 😍;1
Very nice app that helps you organize your activities and your routines. I highly recommend this app;1
This is exactly what I needed and it's so easy to use. You can repeat and clone schedules and it doesn't take too much time to do it. I love it and I'm sad I didn't find it earlier 😭;1
It is a awesome app for maintaining daily routine. Edit - I found them, thanks.;1
This app keeps me very orginized, with no trouble, i went through countless routine apps, but this one is defentily the best.;1
Amazing! Organized my day for sure! If you are busy but not organized this is the app for you! Absolutely LOVE IT!!!!;1
Very helpful for all... Loving it Helpful in building new habits and much more😁😁😁😁😁;1

Its a really good app. Its help us having a clear shedule and save our time.;1
The app has great routine planner, helps me keep organized! It's important to me for someone with ADHD!;1
If you are looking for a perfect organiser of your time. This is the app for you. Love it and you will too if you are like me and want some organisation in your life. Perfect!;1
It's weird, like i didn't even open the app but the fact they answer criticism and try to improve, based on what's here, is just the type i want.;1
All free, unobtrusive advertisements, easy to use and tonnes of categories you can make yourself too.;1
Simplistic, yet intuitive. Makes efficiency practical, luv it;1
Best app for students to study.👌;1
This is the best app if you want to plan each and every hour of your day. This app will make sure that no time of yours is wasted at unproductive activities.;1

Thanks for the response to the developer you guys are great. I hope I can make better feedback in future;1
Gud;1
Very nice app but it doesn't have promodomo technology;1
COOL UPDATE GUYS!;1
I've downloaded this app 3 times in the past. Unfortunately, it can't force me not to procrastinate. But every time I decide to get back on a routine and use block Time to plan my day, this app is my go-to. It's relatively easy to use and understand, and it has all of the functionality that my ADHD brain could possibly handle;1
One of my favourite!;1
Actually, with this app I was able to uphold a routine for three-four solid months. It's pretty darn good if you ask me.;1
Best app to organise my daily tasks and making a exact routine that i want. It really helpul for students..;1
Yea it's the app I was looking for.;1
Really good app;1
I like it very much;1
Incredibly flexible and versatile.;1
TimeTune is an AMAZING app. I honestly wouldn't change a single thing about it. I absolutely love and enjoy the app and its great features a lot. Truly one of the best apps I've had on my phone.;1
The new update of July 2020 is just awesome. Specially the details on Popup is great. Icons are very flashy and a clean look of app inspite of whatever you add.♥️;1
I literally tried each and every one , but this one freaking manages my life like a catalyst ! Love it bamn !! ♥╣[-_-]╠♥;1
Best!;1
Just the way I wanted. I searched and only found this one that organizes in such a clear and simple way. Free content is amazing, can't wait to try out the paid stuff. Will recommend to anyone.;1
I've been using this app for the past 4 years now, and I must say, this new UI update was the single biggest improvement that I've ever experienced in an app. The new tag system simplifies everything, and it looks so much better. I'd always struggled with giving a block of time multiple equally important activites, but the new design caters for it upfront. It may sound really small, but it used to be the most annoying part of the experience for me, and now it's my favorite thing about the app!;1
Ughhh gosh jus get on wid these reviews...wut yuck is this 😬😬😬👌👌👌;1
Love the new design. Thank you. Keep up the great work.;1
Simply amazing app. Intuitive combined with necessarily complex, for all levels of users. I also bought pro and look forward to using it (good that you can pay, it gives the devs incentive to support and improve the app) Love it, very clean and useful!;1
This app is exactly what I've been looking for. It helps me fully plan out my day. It would be nice if it had calender support and locations, though;1
This helped me realize how much unused time I had, then it helped me allocate that time intentionally, then it helped me follow the new routine. It's had a big positive effect on my life!;1
It's great to use my daily timetable and hope it helps my life ^^ but I don't hear any sound/song when notification since yesterday. =\ TimeTune replied my problem and I just found out that it's my device setting is already off sound in app notification.. now it's working. No wonder. Haha thank you so much! I gave you 5 stars now!;1
Helped me organise my life and improve my work flow;1
It's really great, is helping me a lot to make a routine.;1
This is exactly what I hav been looking for for ages, thank you very much!;1
Really gave my life structure;1
Me encanta, me a ayudado mucho a organizarme;1
Best app to schedule ur routine👍👍👍👍;1
Nice app...Best one to manage the time of professionals and kids together...;1
What everyone is looking for in an app like this.;1
It's great for what i need. Good way of becoming productive and monitoring my day;1
It helps make a daily plan as per the period and is very fexible. Those who cant follow a weekly routine (like me 😂) should definitely download this app. It helps you experiment. Also i like the updated version more than the earlier one. Thanks You TimeTune 😇😊;1
Really a good app. It is perfect to set a daily schedule and you get notified on time.;1
Excellent App... Still New to me though but i like the interface.. thumbs up..;1
Best app i ever seen;1
Great.;1
I can follow my daily properly without any waste of time;1

Gooood app it helps me Alot!!;1
This saves my time;1
Awsome app;1
Best Scheduling app on android. Go for it. Have no doubts;1
"Best app for planning out your days/week. Simply amazing! Also, I think a little tutorial at the beginning might be useful, so that the user would understand how everything works! (In fact I had some troubles understanding how to use the tags and set a routine lol) but after a while you will understand everything, and realize how simple and wonderful this app is! Thank you Edit: I totally missed the ""Help"" button where the tutorial is indeed present! Sorry :)";1
I can't live without it;1
Helo, first i used to not complete my works but when i downloaded this app i completed all my works in 1 day only actually my work takes 1 week but whenever I downloaded this app i completed it in 1 day only. Its so awesome app❤❤😀😁😉;1

Niceee;1
Great app;1
Very good Easy and convenient to use, can be used in widget helps in displaying upcoming activities. Must have for those who plan many activities in a day and need to c their schedules regularly.;1
Love it always;1
Really a great app for task management🔥🔥;1
I did the free trial. This planner does NOT have push notifications. You can set up your events and appointments, even make them reoccurring, but Artful Agenda App will NOT remind you or notify you. What good is a digital planner if it does not have push notifications. If I am going to pay for an app, it should at least have most of the features a free app has.;0
There's one thing that makes me crazy about apps. It's when their developers don't tell you up front what the cost is of after the free trial. So, I won't be trying this as much as I'd like to.;0
Did not like this at all. Difficult to sync with all my different calendars and limited formatting and design options as well. Also hard to unsubscribe. Very round about process. I do not recommend this.;0
"Update: After I read the reply I redownloaded this app. Waste of $4.25! It's NOT WORTH ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY! Not a lot of extras to charge money AND it's only cute on a computer. The ""lists"" are not very easy to make and I never did find the ""meal plan"" or journal parts. The goal part is not on the app. Any.do is FREE and a lot easier for lists with reminders and also includes a calendar. Not worth the cost. Yeah it's cute but not as easy to use as other free calendars. Pretty disappointed...";0
This app is a total rip-off! I stupidly paid for the one-time subscription of $35.00, had the app less than one hour. The print was so tiny I could barely see it. A lesson learned the hard way...no more app subscriptions for me. Users beware! Forewarned is forarmed. Hang on to your wallets if you try out this app!;0
I downloaded this after seeing someone advertise it. Looked cool so I figured try it out, right? Until I downloaded and it prompted me for a subscription. Lady you are nuts. People rather by the paper agenda at the store for cheaper. You do not see the full texture of the book, it's an online planner on top of it. I'm not paying you for that. I downloaded a FREE calendar that does the exact same thing. Terrible marketing skills.;0
SLOW on laptop, does not sync with website. No stickers on app, just laptop. I set up my calander on my ohone, then went to desktop. I can't open up my calander unlesss I give payment info on laptop. I already set up payment in Google Play. And to get to that screen takes a LONG time.;0
My events show up at the wrong time in my calendar even when they've been manually entered. What's the point of a planner that doest let you plan.;0
Tried to put in my first event and it failed to log it. I uninstalled it same day.;0
Terrible! I transferred all my lists from Google to this app do they would all be in one place and they didn't save! So beyond frustrating.;0
App install page says nothing about it being a free trial for 2 weeks. So you have to pay to use this app. This is not disclosed on the app page from which you initiate install.;0
only option is paid subsctiption app? No thanks. I can't constantly pay for apps within my budget so I'd much rather have the option to use a version with ads.;0
Doesn't work. Error messages appear everywhere when I open the app.;0
You can't even try it out. They are automatically asking you to pick a subscriber plan before you can even see a calendar or anything.;0
could you make an option to not stop the trial because i dont think some people want to do the trial and it doesn't mention that before you download the app and when you do you guys get paid.;0
Why, why, why... Let us try it without forcing us to pay first. You just lost a customer.;0
It wouldn't let me try the app. It just told me to subscribe.;0
Why when i put in an event at 10am until 11am is it then going in the 8-9pm slot?;0
This is a pay to play calendar only;0
Impossible to use.;0
If this was free, yeah I'd totally use this. Who honestly wants to pay to keep track of your life? Wth?;0
"I can't pay for it?? It says ""platform error"" something about ""IAP not prepared"", so can't do free trial either...please help";0
always freezing;0

I did the free trial. This planner does NOT have push notifications. You can set up your events and appointments, even make them reoccurring, but Artful Agenda App will NOT remind you or notify you.

I wanted to love it. And I did, until I needed to add my other Gmail accts to it. Damn near IMPOSSIBLE. I am currently in the 2 wk trial. I reached out to tech support asking for an explanation on how to sync my other accounts, as all of the app tutorials didn't mention how. They sent me back a link to a FAQ telling me WHAT to do, but not HOW to do it. Every Google search had me come up short. I give up. Cancelling. My default calendar syncs em all just fine. Wish I had the pretty stickers, etc.;0
I was interested in this app until I had to put in my credit card for a free trial without even knowing the price.;0
Don't like not being able to even look at the app without credit card entry and account sign up.;0
I really like the app/online portal but having everything in one does me no good w/o push notifications & I wish this had a widget so I didn't have to open the app to look at everything.i paid for this & I don't feel like I got my investment back as I maybe use the app once in a blue moon. It looks great but it just doesn't work to what I feel is it's full protein. I hope you add this & don't make me pay for it.;0
While in looks this app is lovely, it had a big issue for me, price. I am always looking for an android replacement for goodnotes (an ios exclusive app I use for digital planning). Visualy the app is beautiful and it seemed to be very well put together, but be willing to pay $40 a year (special price?) monthly $4.99. In the current state of peoples pandemic budget, personally I feel it's WAY to expensive. Heck Goodnotes is $10 once with updates, am I missing something? Happy Planner $20 even..;0
Love it and it's good start to build on! But there appears to be syncing issues between calendars no matter how many times I refresh. I'm going to give it time before I give up on it. I'm big on my Happy Planner and would totally ditch it for this if it had similar features, such as a budget planner one could add. I wouldn't use most of the stickers, which is unfortunate because I love my stickers in my planners. Overall....good start?;0
Absolutely no mention of paying to use this app until you've downloaded it and signed up. Too bad, it looked pretty.;0
Okay if you like planning with Google. It's exactly like that, just prettier. I don't see how this can replace a paper planner at all.;0
There is a subscription to the service. I wish i would have knownBEFORE I downloaded. Looks beautiful though.;0
Its ok;0

Great so far. I recommend having the lists saved offline since I went to the grocery store & there was no signal so my list didn't load. That was inconvenient. I use it for priority tasks for the day, meal plans and different colors & stickers.;1
I really really like it. Simple to use and it seems to be syncing ok. Love the colors and how it looks in my windows 10 browser. Look forward to updates like new stickers in the future.;1
Love the app ... was able to download it to my iPhone. I went to download it to my Samsung tablet. BUT once I hit open, all I get is black screen. I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it several times and it still won't work;1
Updating to 4 stars because push notifications are now live.. Not Fully Developed. This app could be great, but in their rush to put it out, the features are highly lacking. No push notifications, you cannot upload stickers, no widget, pretty buggy. I really liked the idea of it, but it needs improvement. I will update to 5 stars if and when these features are added. They did reach out to me to resolve my issues, so I am updating to three stars.;1
Love it so far! I would like to be able to move appointments around on the same day. for example, they are listed in the order you enter them. But I want my am on the top of each page and my p.m. appointments in the afternoon on the month view. it would be great if you can just drag and drop. I also would like a printing feature for my lists so that I can actually print them out while packing.;1
Plz ???❤1.Widget that shows the current date, list of upcoming events, 1 click option to open calendar 2.Ability to set reminders/alerts for scheduled events 3. Ability to sync to phone's stock calendar (Android) 4.Additional settings ability to customize the color of the circle indicating current date 5. Ability to actually see the inspirational quotes in the app even if a new tab was necessary 6.Ability to create tasks and designate their priority as high, low or routine along with the option;1
I love this app! It makes my day to day so much more organized and pretty. It allows you to keep a check on your daily water intake, your to do lists, grocery lists, events, whatever you have in mind! I find that the layout of it all helps me to maintain productivity. I only wish there were a widget available!;1
I love the concept & look of this mobile app & the desktop version. I wish I could set recurring tasks or add time reminders to tasks. You also can't set reminders if you add an event directly into Artful Agenda. You have to add it to your Google calendar first to set the reminder then let it sync to Artful Agenda. I've paid for the year subscription & I'm really hoping it has more functionality by the end of my subscription or I won't be renewing.;1
Could use more fonts and options and a habit tracker. But it's a great start.;1
just installed Love that syncs with google. Wish the mobile app allowed Screen rotation. Wish I could Zoom on the week a month view. I understand mobile i in beta. Looking forward to the evolution.;1
Love this app so far, it just needs push notifications, widgets, and a habit tracker, hut all in due time I'm sure 😊;1
Love the look of this agenda. List feature is great way to track & complete to do lists!;1
Like the app, but wish it had widgets to be able to see calendar at all times;1
So far I really like it. when will the stickers and tablet features be ready?;1
I live this calendar app, but I wish it was a widget.;1
so far so good;1
I really like this app so far. I've been using it a week now and it does everything I need it to do. I normally use the Astaire bullet journal method with a rolling weekly task list. But im still able to make a weekly task list and assign tasks to certain days. I can also migrate the ones that don't get done. I will certainly keep this app and don't mind the subscription because it works so well for me! I'll check back in again in a few weeks.;1

Absolutely loving electronic planner. I've been looking for something that fits what I need for AGES and once it has recurring tasks,it will have everything I need 😍 I've contacted support a few times and the response is really quick and resolves queries at first attempt.;1
The developers of this digital planner have done a wonderful job! I feel like Goldilocks and the 3(00) planners because I've tried so many before this. THANK YOU for making this multi platform accessible... that is the reason I was able to sign up! I cannot wait to see what other features and development you do, but for now I am really happy with the great mix of function and design.;1
"I don't do ""free trials"" where my credit card information is mandatory to try it out first Edit:. Still don't like the above but I have to say the app is about perfect for me in every way. It's everything I could ask for in a planner app, and I love that it also integrates with Outlook. It's brilliant and worth the money";1
This Agenda has changed my life. I can easily switch between family, business and personal calendars. I can color code events and the tasks lists have made my followups in business, and my daily home tasks seamless. Im no longer the mom losing my mind (as much anyway). I HIGHLY recommend!!!!;1
I really like this app and I'm stoked to hear about upcoming updates that will be game changing. This app is just what I'm looking for. A functional and attractive agenda to replace my physical planner;1
Love how functional and pretty this planner is! I paper plan but this is perfect for on-the-go.;1
This app is adorable but i'll never really use it. Its too bland. Great colors and styles just not enough to keep me interested.;1
Exactly what I needed, feels fancy like a paper planner but syncs perfectly with online calendars!;1
Where do I start. I'm a paper planner addict, but I work in the Healthcare Field and can't bring all pens, stickers, and other paraphernalia. I cannot believe I can work on my schedule from my laptop and it immediately transfers to my phone. I'm floored. What a great thing, not to mention it's only going to get better as time goes! It gives me a bit of peace and calm to work on my planner during the day, thank you Kate!;1
Love this app!! I'm much more organized with it!;1
Amazing planner! I've been using the desktop version linked with my Google calendar and it was working great! Now with the app, it's even better than I thought it would be! I love having all of my appointments in one place and it's so easy to use! I especially enjoy the extra feature of being able to add notes to my tasks! It has helped me stay on task with work, cleaning, and everything else!;1
I have always been a paper planner girl, but now that I've tried Artful Agenda I will never go back! I love the custom covers, adorable stickers and the ability to link multiple calendars together in one place! It's extremely functional and I am obsessed with the fact that I can access it straight from my phone (and computer, too!). No more anxiety about losing my paper planner...loving this beautiful, digital way to organize!;1
So I love this app- I think it's perfect for what I needed, at the time. Sadly my job changed and so did my need for a calendar/planner. Artful Agenda was still great but I found myself no longer using the stickers or really having time to add information to it. I canceled my subscription- they were super easy to work with. I still recommend this app to girls when asked - ❤❤ I love and miss Artful agenda. When my job changes again I'll be back.;1
I love this calendar app! This is the only digital calendar that I have been happy with! I can easily see what I have coming up. I love the 'tasks' and the ability to make my to do list right on the app...and the ability to easily snooze a task ii didn't get to until tomorrow. LOVE IT!;1
This is perfect. I'm able to get all of my family calendars in one place without having to lug around a traditional agenda. Also they are wonderful at fixing any issues and responding to all emails.;1
I absolutely LOVE this app! I am a very OCD person when it comes to being organized and love my planner but really wanted something digital...very portable and environmentally friendly... I found it here! I love the way it syncs in seconds across my devices, phone, iPad, Google home device, and laptop. It’s super user friendly and very customizable! I tried several other digital planners and this one beats them hands down!;1
I never thought I could switch to a digital planner and yet here I am, my husband is so happy to see everything that used to take him time sifting through my calendar. We're all synced up on Google calendar now and i have the beautiful version for me to see on Artful Agenda with the lists I need to run my box and family!;1
Perfect, I'm loving every element so far ,I love that I can at some point once it's all done use it like my paper planner and sync them with my phone, I hate carrying my paper planner and also having to update my cell calendar , I love and cant wait to see and use all the coming soons I'm so excited ,I'm hoping also a widget will be something to come soon as well so that I can have it open on my phone and not always have to open the app for quick reference. Keep it up;1
The perfect marriage of pen & pixel. If you love the features and visuals of a paper planner but stink at keeping up with it, this is for you. It allows me to: -sync to my Google calendars, & color code -switch an event from one Google calendar to another which even Google calendar won't let me do -look at my schedule as a single day, week, or month without having to put items in 3 different places -set and write down goals -track water & meal plan -make lists -check off tasks;1
Super cute & functional! It syncs with both my personal (google) and work (outlook) calendars, space to plan priorities and meals (weekly/daily views) and LISTS! I don't use the stickers as much, but all the colors for events and background are enough for me right now. Can't wait for the widget to come out someday!;1
I love this app! It's a perfect replacement for my paper calendar. I love that I can have my schedule, meal plan, tasks to do and more all at the tip of my fingers wherever I am. I'm excited for all the plans they have to add even more awesome features!;1
as someone who is obsessed with trendy planners with pops of color I can't get enough of artful agenda. it combines the convenience of a digital calendar with the joy of having a fun planner to organize everything in. and they ade always adding new features that are awesome!;1
"This is a perfect app solution for as a hybrid between digital and paper calendars. I love the ""extras"" to make is like my paper calendar in visual effects. I also enjoy the ability to combine multiple digital calendars into one! This is perfect!";1
This is my dream calendar app! It works perfectly with my Google calendar while also offering list making capabilities as well as meal planning! As a mom and business owner it gives me everything I need in a digital calendar!;1
I just ADORE this app. It has saved my sanity on more than one occasion. Super simple to use and I love being able to color code things. And the water tracker, my goodness.;1
Omg just what I've been looking for and you can also have it on a desk top so whenever I'm working and can't reach my phone for booking clients this comes in handy, can't wait to see what is coming soon 😍😍 Edit: I went on the computer to see if there is a major difference and OMG there is I totally love the desktop site I cannot wait for more features to come I totally recommend this app to anyone🥰🥰🥰 so in love;1
"I have thoroughly enjoyed my AA ever since I found out about last year! I had been looking for an organizer that I use as a calendar and to handle my many ""things to do"" lists. Thank you Katy for your vision and concept.";1
My Planner system is now complete! I love the web app and now with the mobile app, my on-the -go planning is also on point. The app is fast, beautiful and a perfect planning companion. Awesome!;1
Love, love, love this app!! I have been a paper planner lover for 30 years and I just switched to Artful Agenda and I couldn't be more pleased. Try it, you'll love it!!!;1
I love Artful Agenda!!! It is the beauty and organization of a paper planner with the convenience of being online and on my phone! love the new featured that keep rolling out!;1
I have been using Artful Agenda on a desktop this year and love all it's features. Now the app makes it even more accessible. I love planning meals and mapping out my day!;1
This app is literally like a dream come true. It is girly and has all of the things a paper planner has but electronically. I love it!;1
Love this app!!! It's so easy to use. It helps me be organized with the option of having multiple lists. Plus....it's colorful!!;1
"Love it so far! Excited for the ""coming soon"" items. I use a paper planner bc digital planners never seem to have the layout I want but so far this seems to be a great replacement!";1
I love that all my calendars are integrated in one spot, work, school, kids, small business. its pretty, functional, tracks meals, to dos and water intake. I'm thrilled to have something pretty to add joy to my day. Thanks Beta Team!;1
love love love this!!!! its the best of both worlds - paper and digital and syncs with all your calendars ! awesome app!;1
nice planner that replaced paper planner. i absolutely love it! no more spending money on Etsy for digital planners that do not give me notifications. this one does!;1
I love that this app combines all of my various calendars (work and personal) to have a quick total view of my day(s). Such a timesaver!!!;1
It's a beautiful digital calendar that u can customize with a cover and stickers and fonts - so much prettier than the standard calendar that comes on your phone!;1
LOVE THIS APP!! This app had saved me so many stressful headaches!! The creator is ALWAYS on top of it and so helpful with everyone's questions. Install this app - you won't be sorry!;1
I normally don't review apps, but this one is amazing. This digital planner was exactly what I wanted. Give it a try, you won't regret it.;1
this app is just what I have been looking for - it really feels like a paper planner.;1
I love all of the features. Especially the lists and the stickers.;1
This has replaced my paper planner (and I am addicted to it)! The most amazing app and product ever!;1
This is the perfect calendar app! And its gorgeous to boot!;1
the perfect planner app! I'm so thankful for Artful Agenda!;1
This app is practical, beautiful, fun, and easy to use! Highly recommend!;1
I've been a paper planner girl for years! I need the pretty colors and stickers. While I still have a paper planner (that hasn't been touched for months) I needed something on my phone because with 3 kids spaced 6 years apart, we are busy. We homeschool year round as well as appointments and family stuff. Artful Agenda fits everything I need. Update on the fly and it's PRETTY! I keep a tab open on my desktop as well as the app on my phone. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐;1
Finally something that lets me feel like I'm using a paper planner but I don't accidentally leave it at home!;1
Fun cover, stickers and layouts.;1
perfect hybrid of digital and paper...im in love!;1
This app is beautiful, and has really helped me keep my business, large family, homeschool and church activities all in order! No more chaos for this girl!;1
i am loving this and plan to buy it. do you intend to add a widget for phones and tablets?;1
great app. love it;1
love it. Cant wait for it to do even more.;1
A fun and beautiful way to organize your life! I'm a huge fan!!!;1
The best yet!;1
Obsessed.;1
Awesome app!!!;1

This Agenda has changed my life. I can easily switch between family, business and personal calendars. I can color code events and the tasks lists have made my followups in business, and my daily home tasks seamless. Im no longer the mom losing my mind (as much anyway). I HIGHLY recommend!!!!;1
I really like this app and I'm stoked to hear about upcoming updates that will be game changing. This app is just what I'm looking for. A functional and attractive agenda to replace my physical planner;1
The developers of this digital planner have done a wonderful job! I feel like Goldilocks and the 3(00) planners because I've tried so many before this. THANK YOU for making this multi platform accessible... that is the reason I was able to sign up! I cannot wait to see what other features and development you do, but for now I am really happy with the great mix of function and design.;1
"I don't do ""free trials"" where my credit card information is mandatory to try it out first Edit:. Still don't like the above but I have to say the app is about perfect for me in every way. It's everything I could ask for in a planner app, and I love that it also integrates with Outlook. It's brilliant and worth the money";1
Love how functional and pretty this planner is! I paper plan but this is perfect for on-the-go.;1
This app is adorable but i'll never really use it. Its too bland. Great colors and styles just not enough to keep me interested.;1
Exactly what I needed, feels fancy like a paper planner but syncs perfectly with online calendars!;1
Where do I start. I'm a paper planner addict, but I work in the Healthcare Field and can't bring all pens, stickers, and other paraphernalia. I cannot believe I can work on my schedule from my laptop and it immediately transfers to my phone. I'm floored. What a great thing, not to mention it's only going to get better as time goes! It gives me a bit of peace and calm to work on my planner during the day, thank you Kate!;1
Love this app!! I'm much more organized with it!;1
Obsessed.;1
This is perfect. I'm able to get all of my family calendars in one place without having to lug around a traditional agenda. Also they are wonderful at fixing any issues and responding to all emails.;1
I love all of the features. Especially the lists and the stickers.;1
Super cute & functional! It syncs with both my personal (google) and work (outlook) calendars, space to plan priorities and meals (weekly/daily views) and LISTS! I don't use the stickers as much, but all the colors for events and background are enough for me right now. Can't wait for the widget to come out someday!;1
Love this app!!! It's so easy to use. It helps me be organized with the option of having multiple lists. Plus....it's colorful!!;1
I absolutely LOVE this app! I am a very OCD person when it comes to being organized and love my planner but really wanted something digital...very portable and environmentally friendly... I found it here! I love the way it syncs in seconds across my devices, phone, iPad, Google home device, and laptop. It’s super user friendly and very customizable! I tried several other digital planners and this one beats them hands down!;1
LOVE THIS APP!! This app had saved me so many stressful headaches!! The creator is ALWAYS on top of it and so helpful with everyone's questions. Install this app - you won't be sorry!;1
It's a beautiful digital calendar that u can customize with a cover and stickers and fonts - so much prettier than the standard calendar that comes on your phone!;1
Love, love, love this app!! I have been a paper planner lover for 30 years and I just switched to Artful Agenda and I couldn't be more pleased. Try it, you'll love it!!!;1
"I have thoroughly enjoyed my AA ever since I found out about last year! I had been looking for an organizer that I use as a calendar and to handle my many ""things to do"" lists. Thank you Katy for your vision and concept.";1
I normally don't review apps, but this one is amazing. This digital planner was exactly what I wanted. Give it a try, you won't regret it.;1
This app is beautiful, and has really helped me keep my business, large family, homeschool and church activities all in order! No more chaos for this girl!;1
The perfect marriage of pen & pixel. If you love the features and visuals of a paper planner but stink at keeping up with it, this is for you. It allows me to: -sync to my Google calendars, & color code -switch an event from one Google calendar to another which even Google calendar won't let me do -look at my schedule as a single day, week, or month without having to put items in 3 different places -set and write down goals -track water & meal plan -make lists -check off tasks;1
Fun cover, stickers and layouts.;1
So I love this app- I think it's perfect for what I needed, at the time. Sadly my job changed and so did my need for a calendar/planner. Artful Agenda was still great but I found myself no longer using the stickers or really having time to add information to it. I canceled my subscription- they were super easy to work with. I still recommend this app to girls when asked - ❤❤ I love and miss Artful agenda. When my job changes again I'll be back.;1
Perfect, I'm loving every element so far ,I love that I can at some point once it's all done use it like my paper planner and sync them with my phone, I hate carrying my paper planner and also having to update my cell calendar , I love and cant wait to see and use all the coming soons I'm so excited ,I'm hoping also a widget will be something to come soon as well so that I can have it open on my phone and not always have to open the app for quick reference. Keep it up;1
Awesome app!!!;1
"Love it so far! Excited for the ""coming soon"" items. I use a paper planner bc digital planners never seem to have the layout I want but so far this seems to be a great replacement!";1
i am loving this and plan to buy it. do you intend to add a widget for phones and tablets?;1
Omg just what I've been looking for and you can also have it on a desk top so whenever I'm working and can't reach my phone for booking clients this comes in handy, can't wait to see what is coming soon 😍😍 Edit: I went on the computer to see if there is a major difference and OMG there is I totally love the desktop site I cannot wait for more features to come I totally recommend this app to anyone🥰🥰🥰 so in love;1
great app. love it;1
This app is literally like a dream come true. It is girly and has all of the things a paper planner has but electronically. I love it!;1
I've been a paper planner girl for years! I need the pretty colors and stickers. While I still have a paper planner (that hasn't been touched for months) I needed something on my phone because with 3 kids spaced 6 years apart, we are busy. We homeschool year round as well as appointments and family stuff. Artful Agenda fits everything I need. Update on the fly and it's PRETTY! I keep a tab open on my desktop as well as the app on my phone. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐;1
Amazing planner! I've been using the desktop version linked with my Google calendar and it was working great! Now with the app, it's even better than I thought it would be! I love having all of my appointments in one place and it's so easy to use! I especially enjoy the extra feature of being able to add notes to my tasks! It has helped me stay on task with work, cleaning, and everything else!;1
The best yet!;1
My Planner system is now complete! I love the web app and now with the mobile app, my on-the -go planning is also on point. The app is fast, beautiful and a perfect planning companion. Awesome!;1
I never thought I could switch to a digital planner and yet here I am, my husband is so happy to see everything that used to take him time sifting through my calendar. We're all synced up on Google calendar now and i have the beautiful version for me to see on Artful Agenda with the lists I need to run my box and family!;1
This app is practical, beautiful, fun, and easy to use! Highly recommend!;1
I just ADORE this app. It has saved my sanity on more than one occasion. Super simple to use and I love being able to color code things. And the water tracker, my goodness.;1
love love love this!!!! its the best of both worlds - paper and digital and syncs with all your calendars ! awesome app!;1
love it. Cant wait for it to do even more.;1
Finally something that lets me feel like I'm using a paper planner but I don't accidentally leave it at home!;1
This is my dream calendar app! It works perfectly with my Google calendar while also offering list making capabilities as well as meal planning! As a mom and business owner it gives me everything I need in a digital calendar!;1
nice planner that replaced paper planner. i absolutely love it! no more spending money on Etsy for digital planners that do not give me notifications. this one does!;1
I love this app! It's a perfect replacement for my paper calendar. I love that I can have my schedule, meal plan, tasks to do and more all at the tip of my fingers wherever I am. I'm excited for all the plans they have to add even more awesome features!;1
I have been using Artful Agenda on a desktop this year and love all it's features. Now the app makes it even more accessible. I love planning meals and mapping out my day!;1
A fun and beautiful way to organize your life! I'm a huge fan!!!;1
This is the perfect calendar app! And its gorgeous to boot!;1
I have always been a paper planner girl, but now that I've tried Artful Agenda I will never go back! I love the custom covers, adorable stickers and the ability to link multiple calendars together in one place! It's extremely functional and I am obsessed with the fact that I can access it straight from my phone (and computer, too!). No more anxiety about losing my paper planner...loving this beautiful, digital way to organize!;1
as someone who is obsessed with trendy planners with pops of color I can't get enough of artful agenda. it combines the convenience of a digital calendar with the joy of having a fun planner to organize everything in. and they ade always adding new features that are awesome!;1
"This is a perfect app solution for as a hybrid between digital and paper calendars. I love the ""extras"" to make is like my paper calendar in visual effects. I also enjoy the ability to combine multiple digital calendars into one! This is perfect!";1
I love that this app combines all of my various calendars (work and personal) to have a quick total view of my day(s). Such a timesaver!!!;1
perfect hybrid of digital and paper...im in love!;1
the perfect planner app! I'm so thankful for Artful Agenda!;1
this app is just what I have been looking for - it really feels like a paper planner.;1
This has replaced my paper planner (and I am addicted to it)! The most amazing app and product ever!;1
I love Artful Agenda!!! It is the beauty and organization of a paper planner with the convenience of being online and on my phone! love the new featured that keep rolling out!;1
I love this calendar app! This is the only digital calendar that I have been happy with! I can easily see what I have coming up. I love the 'tasks' and the ability to make my to do list right on the app...and the ability to easily snooze a task ii didn't get to until tomorrow. LOVE IT!;1
I love that all my calendars are integrated in one spot, work, school, kids, small business. its pretty, functional, tracks meals, to dos and water intake. I'm thrilled to have something pretty to add joy to my day. Thanks Beta Team!;1
"## You ""reaching out"" has not, in any way, addressed the question I asked, I'll uninstall. Thanks anyway. ## * Rather disingenuous response. When doing a local backup it informs the user that Manual backup ""will be removed in a future version"". Why would I continue using it if I will not be able to to do a local back up my data at some point ""in the future"" ? * I don't use the ""cloud"" so this will be useless to me if I can't backup locally.";0
I'm struggling with this app. I'm trying so hard to like it but there are basic things that I want it to do that it doesn't seem to be able to do. 1: It doesn't seem to be able to set a reminder for a whole list to alert me during any particular day. Instead I seem to have to set an alarm for each task which means that I would have alarms going off all day. That would drive me insane! 2: It isn't possible to contact the developer through the app. Quite bizarre!;0
This app is ridiculous. You can't delete tasks, move the sub tasks around, modify, or makes notes as the project evolves. It's not intuitive. Essentially I had to write out my list on a piece of paper to build the order. Once it was correct then enter it to this app, which makes this app pointless. Must be the free version's nuisance features driving you towards the paid version.;0
I missed something very important because this app didn't notify me. The phone ran out of battery in the night - the reminder was set to 8am - and I turned on the phone at 9am. Apparently, to this app, that means to just not tell me that the reminder was supposed to go off. Garbage. This literally didn't do the one most important thing it's supposed to do.;0
Looked at the reviews for a solution but The app dev just blames the phone (it's never the same phone) for causing the app not to work. I'm having the same problems of the alarm for a task not going off, not even a notification. Blaming the phone when you so it's not just one device is lazy.;0
Use Google Tasks! It's much better and FREE 🥳 You have to subscribe £1.50 a momth to get full use of this 🤣🤣🤣🤣 It's a basic reminder app. Had it have been a one of payment of a tenner then I'd have brought it but I hate it when you have to subscribe, especially for something so basic as this. They do it so you subscribe and forget about it. Just greed.;0
2nd Edited review: The app is worst for reminders since it takes many minutes to fire. Which simply means, the app is worthless. Now the customer service told me that I'm using a cheap device, when in fact it i m using a premium budget phone. Bulls**t customer service as well since they clearly can't take the blame like a real man/woman. Bunch of frauds n scammers tryna make their customer buy their failed invention. Go fu*k urself customer service! Good luck selling nud*s coz u failed it here!;0
Snoozing and recurrence behave erratically, thus alarms often don't happen when they should. Developer did support, separately and only up to a point, issues with notifications which are specific to my device.;0
It is confusing.. I ws looking forward to get a list of tasks so tht I can mark it done or not done. 2nd review after receiving feedback from Dev. Steve: Steve I think I don't hv tht much time to personally write to u and I guess thts why play store has review system. I hope this helps. Thnks. If possible try to b polite to ur future customer.;0
Alarms and notification is not working ...even after battery optimization being disabled...checked all the settings;0
Not user friendly. Almost impossible to delete or edit lists. Format is garbage.;0
Does not repeat every two days as set. Pretty damn useless. Uninstalled.;0
Useless app... Niether Reminder nor notifications ping... Wasted too much time on ficing issue.. Even followed developer's instructions..;0
I have one old version backup file and now it is not getting restored. Please help;0
Have been paying for premium each month for several months now and now it's not syncing across devices and its telling me to upgrade to premuin on both fone and 2nd device when iam paying for premium (pathetic)... Canceling subscription and uninstalling!;0
Unable to restore,app version mismatch? I just download the app and then i make a backup copy then, uninstall and restore it back again and that what it says. Please do fix it and also make some Auto backup or Auto save features;0
Thr notion of paying a monthly fee for this is laughable. I will stick with Todoist for a fre more bucks a month.;0
Sir plzzz ad some more option like Upcoming task and DONE TASK SO THAT I CAN SEE ALL DETAIL ABOUT MY UPCOMING PROJECT AND HISTORY IN SEPRATE OPTIONS OBOUT THIS And add repeat option until i will not stop or snooz the task Some time i m not able to see my mob. So if it will repeat automatically after some duration until i am not select any option And yes i know there is option about repeat i am talking abour different one like auto until i will not choose any option;0
Monthly payments for a todo app? Not gonna happen, thank you.;0
Useless app. It dint give any notification.;0
When i set to remind me daily it shows even in past and it doesn't remind me kindly let me know the way to set it proper;0
Scheduling reminder intervals does not work!!!!;0
Unable to share to do list with another account;0
I was so happy about this app. To my big disappointment, after I lost a lot of time to set my tasks and to prioritize, I had the very unpleasant experience to have all the tasks deleted, also the name of the list and no possibility to recover. I do NOT recommend it.;0
Just a list app. You can't do anything else unless it's on a list.;0
**UPDATE**. I uninstalled this app. It now causes my phone to crash when I reboot-which is everyday. *******I downloaded this app because the other app I was using wouldn't always notify me. Also, they recently decided to change from an analog clock face to having to scroll (similar to a digital clock) to set the due time. I tested this app before I started copying all my tasks, but I came across a problem. When creating a repeat, there is no way to set it to do a certain day of the month (ie: the 3rd Saturday of the month, or the Last Sunday of the month). This is a big issue for me because I have certain things I want to do, but it's not always on the same date of the month. Hopefully, this can be added/changed soon.;0
No alarm/reminder 🙄;0
Used it until simple backup was premiumized. Restore wont work between different versions unless you modi-hack the file. Author would not tell you that you can do it though if you ask his help ! . Restore dont recognize my backup file at all so all my lists are basically inaccessible now. Will never install this again and I suggest anyone who values his data not to !;0
Confusing and clunky.;0
Definitely I appropriate your hard work and this app different from all those big guys apps, but question is if someone lost the phone or uninstalled the app, what is the purpose this app?, So i'm just suggesting, > you can limit the how many task can be added by users without premium >Opt. In Ads for auto backup;0
Too complicated and time consuming to set a task. No way to repeat on a monthly basis and specific day of the week at the same time. Not worth the time it takes to use it. Uninstalling.;0
Used to work ok, now, something is skrewy. Now, if I restart my phone, EVERY SINGLE task comes up as a notification, never mind of when the tasks were/are due, and the schedule I set. Now, after I dismiss tasks, they pop up again, ignoring its schedule. Also, wish app could remember which day the task is for. If you have a daily task that you complete after midnight, it thinks you completed it early and won't remind you later that day. Finally, wish app opened to an overview of all lists.;0
I do not like the functionality of the app. I found it is very easy to delete a sub list. But if you create a second list I could not figure out how to delete it after going through all settings. I also did not like the fact that you can only add one item within the sub list. Other people may be okay with these nuances, but for me it's not. I only use this app for about a half an hour and then deleted it.;0
after few months it started not checking the task. I mean I check and few hours later it is unchecked. it should be cleared and the next date for the same task should be displayed, example: task 1 to date 01/jan/2019 and repeat task 1 to date 01/feb/2019. after checking the task for January the task for February should be displayed, but after some time the task for January is unchecked.;0
I removed this paid app. I missed about a dozen events over the few months I owned this. I would look at the app a few minutes after an event was supposed to pop up, and it showed that it had missed. I'm trying out Simple Calendar, which testing seems to work better.;0
Updated and now no longer sends the task again set to daily if you dismiss the notification.;0
Needlessly compicated for a to do list app. try to add a new item to your list and youll accidentally add a new list. try to swipe to switch between lists and youll remove an item from your list. What did you just remove? Hard to say, cant seem to find an undo option among the numerous other options.;0
Has no sign in option only export and the file won't open, so unless you have an IT friend you lose your file which meant all the stuff I put in tasks has gotten lost. If the developer revolves this is I will edit this review.;0
It does'nt work at all. No alarm,no notification nothing at all even after going thru all the settings. Just wonder how your app get its 4.7 rating.;0
How is it possible to be unable to restore my data?;0
at the beginning was good but i wait two months later and the app keep putting back as not done reminders that i mark as done already and the other task that have date and mark as priority don't even showed me, if you can fix that ill stay with the app otherwise i will keep looking... sadly the only remid app that work good was the apple one but i don't have iphone anymore so? came on please make this one work;0
Mr. Stephen today i setted my daily schedule with remainders on this app. But any single remainder didn't rang with alarm, It doesn't notified me about my tasks & schedules.;0
"Thought this was a great app until I realized it doesn't get rid of the ""checked"" daily tasks to remind you of the new daily tasks... and that is exactly what I was using this for... DAILY tasks I need done. When I check ""remove checked tasks"" it does NOTHING and those checked tasks just stay there. :(";0
It doesn't ring the alarm at the right time. only when I open my phone, it starts ringing. useless for me because I want it to ring at the right time and remind me on my realme phone. Highly disappointed! :(;0
I set a reminder to do a task daily at a certain time, however, this app does not retain the same time on the daily reminders. it will remind you and set the task to do but at an earlier time.;0
there are better and simple other apps which provide automatic online sync or backup feature like Micr_oso_ft's to do, and many other. why people think this app easy, it's not. I donated on this app and wasted.;0
Lag all the time;0
I just removed this app! I missed several events in the last couple of months because it did not notify me!!!!!;0
I don't get a notification or any alarm after i set the due date reminder at all. I've already tried a couple of times how do i fix this. My settings also allow notifications for the app. Also how do i set widget on home screen thanks.;0
Well it's broken now. I haven't messed with any settings in or out of the app and now there's no alarm. It just vibrates. I checked and it all still has the alarms and correct sounds yet it only vibrates when it shows a reminder. Why do these reminder apps always break?;0
Doesn't have a built-in backup and even after exporting a backup file - an error shows up. Additionally, the support email is an invalid email address. A total waist of time for setting it.;0
Unresponsive widget, did not work at all on my phone.;0
Subscription only. No outright purchase. Too bad. Seems like a nice app.;0
Would be nice if you could import tasks from other applications, but not only is that a problem, but importing from a previous version of Tasks is impossible too? Nevermind. I'll just stick to what I got.;0
Looked good, but wasn't. After installing Tasks, my keyboard stopped appearing for all my apps. It was only when I removed Tasks (as a last resort) that the keyboard appeared again.;0
Too complicated, trying to add items to a list, it keeps trying to use the item names instead to make a new list or send the old list to this.;0
Can't rely for reminders. No alarm comes even if I select Alarm. Because of relying on this app I missed an important task.;0
it was alright in the beginning but search bar disappeared after adding my tasks. guess there is bug who can't handle long task list. not recommending.;0
When I share a list with someone over messenger or sms, just the name of the list is shared, not the actual list with an ability to collaborate;0
NO INSTRUCTIONS I can't even get started because there are no instructions. I put in list title groceries and that's it when I try to make a list it asks for sub titles won't let me even start a list just sends ya in circles DELETE DELETE;0
I tried it and didn't like it. It wasn't as easy to use and more complicated than needed to be.;0
When you try to write a task and you want to set the reminder at the same time you have to make a reminder for each one and its wasting my time. If I could I would rate this app 0 stars;0
Terrible!!! I'm not getting the pre alerts I set or the reminders themselves. I go in to check on upcoming reminders & see outdated ones in red that never alerted me!!;0
Don't use this unless you sync your tasks. The backup and restore functionality from one device to the next is bad.;0
I use it for awhile then deleted 👎 It is take more time to use than other Note Apps., confusing and have no reason to keep it ⭐ Many better Note Apps out there ⭐;0
Edit: I'm using this application many year since release. And i'm loved it and donate, Now you make this application subscription $15 a year? Really?? Not happy with that...;0
App is very buggy. Completed tasks keep showing up as not completed. Notification alarm won't work. Uninstalling.;0
I settled an alarm on this app. But it never popped up. This looks like a great app but please fix this. All my notifications in this app is open.;0
Was really enjoying this & then the notifications just stopped which is a big part of what I needed the app for:( annoying, finding a new app for this now;0
Why was I charged $1.49 for this app? I was charged 2/4/2020.;0
ive tried this app 2 times. Its great but everytime i use it it installs pop up adds all over my phone. As soon as I go to open one app their is an add...not cool. I deleted it for the 3 and final time.;0
Garbage. The one time I can't remember if i checked the notification for taking my medication or not, there was no way to go and see which days I checked it or not. What's the point of that?;0
I deleted a list but I still get alarms for one of the tasks in that list, even after restarting my phone.;0
Dont work, the best it got was the vibration notification worked. I can't get any sound at all from this app.;0
A simple app that could not be more complicated to operate.;0
This app will not update nor uninstall properly. Fix it and I'll try it again.;0
Why isn't this app getting downloaded There is some issue with the app It had been recommended to me by my buddy but this thing isn't getting installed on my phone;0
I cant even get on thing on the opening page much less start a list??;0
Very poor application.... Repeating reminder not working...useless app;0
Always missing the notifications even when it is not optimized and restricted in background.;0
it was great until it disappeared. Very unhappy that I lost the app and ALL my info.;0
my mobile is getting switched off after installing.it worked fine on 1st day of installing. please fix it;0
app is awesome, but in this no login facility and assign task;0
too much setup. i just want to write my notes not title & subtitle everything! on the plus side, no permissions🙂;0
alarms and notifications don't work which is crucial to an organiser;0
Do not have the account sync feature, how we backup data when we change device ?!;0
Absolutely useless, worked once then never again. Am now living in amonst my household waste like stig of the dump 👍🏻;0
Swipe to delete is terrible. Takes almost 5 swipes so work rendering the app useless.;0
Dear developers, thank you for deleting all my reminders after updating the app! It was not pleasant at all, believe me!;0
Tried making a simple to do list. Was gone when I went back later;0
I am not able to set the time . It is automatically taking the remainder timing;0
Need to make more convinient I just set 3 time alarm for the task but it didnt work;0
Unable to manage easily.. complicated;0
After a week my tasks never showed up. Completely stopped working 👍;0
I wanted a to do list.. this is not such.. continually asking to name things unnecessarily complicated ~ KISS;0
Loved for a while. One fine day my subtasks got deleted. It was in a task for which i didn't set any due date. Bad experience.;0
Recurrent tasks don't work;0
Very confusing, only the creator knows...;0
Can only put 5 tasks before having to pay;0
doesn't allow you to do a Samsung back up and restore;0
I was so happy about this app. To my big disappointment, after I lost a lot of time to set my tasks and to prioritize, I had the very unpleasant experience to have all the tasks deleted, also the name of the list and no possibility to recover. I do NOT recommend it.;0
this app not sending me any notification.;0
Bed application;0
Worst app;0
Does not repeat every two days as set. Pretty damn useless. Uninstalled.;0

Why would I continue using it if I will not be able to to do a local back up my data at some point ""in the future"" ? * I don't use the ""cloud"" so this will be useless to me if I can't backup locally.";0
2nd Edited review: The app is worst for reminders since it takes many minutes to fire. Which simply means, the app is worthless. Now the customer service told me that I'm using a cheap device, when in fact it i m using a premium budget phone. Bulls**t customer service as well since they clearly can't take the blame like a real man/woman. Bunch of frauds n scammers tryna make their customer buy their failed invention. Go fu*k urself customer service! Good luck selling nud*s coz u failed it here!;0
Mr. Stephen today i setted my daily schedule with remainders on this app. But any single remainder didn't rang with alarm, It doesn't notified me about my tasks & schedules.;0
I'm better with myself nowadays. Cheers;0
Alarms and notification is not working ...even after battery optimization being disabled...checked all the settings;0
Thr notion of paying a monthly fee for this is laughable. I will stick with Todoist for a fre more bucks a month.;0
Confusing and clunky.;0
Updated and now no longer sends the task again set to daily if you dismiss the notification.;0
Absolutely useless, worked once then never again. Am now living in amonst my household waste like stig of the dump 👍🏻;0
Unable to restore,app version mismatch? I just download the app and then i make a backup copy then, uninstall and restore it back again and that what it says. Please do fix it and also make some Auto backup or Auto save features;0
I tried it and didn't like it. It wasn't as easy to use and more complicated than needed to be.;0
It is given reminders;0
No reminder for tasks;0
Sir plzzz ad some more option like Upcoming task and DONE TASK SO THAT I CAN SEE ALL DETAIL ABOUT MY UPCOMING PROJECT AND HISTORY IN SEPRATE OPTIONS OBOUT THIS And add repeat option until i will not stop or snooz the task Some time i m not able to see my mob. So if it will repeat automatically after some duration until i am not select any option And yes i know there is option about repeat i am talking abour different one like auto until i will not choose any option;0
Unable to share to do list with another account;0
Have been paying for premium each month for several months now and now it's not syncing across devices and its telling me to upgrade to premuin on both fone and 2nd device when iam paying for premium (pathetic)... Canceling subscription and uninstalling!;0
Very poor application.... Repeating reminder not working...useless app;0
It does'nt work at all. No alarm,no notification nothing at all even after going thru all the settings. Just wonder how your app get its 4.7 rating.;0
**UPDATE**. I uninstalled this app. It now causes my phone to crash when I reboot-which is everyday. *******I downloaded this app because the other app I was using wouldn't always notify me. Also, they recently decided to change from an analog clock face to having to scroll (similar to a digital clock) to set the due time. I tested this app before I started copying all my tasks, but I came across a problem. When creating a repeat, there is no way to set it to do a certain day of the month (ie: the 3rd Saturday of the month, or the Last Sunday of the month). This is a big issue for me because I have certain things I want to do, but it's not always on the same date of the month. Hopefully, this can be added/changed soon.;0
Dose not work;0
Just a list app. You can't do anything else unless it's on a list.;0
Too complicated and time consuming to set a task. No way to repeat on a monthly basis and specific day of the week at the same time. Not worth the time it takes to use it. Uninstalling.;0
When i set to remind me daily it shows even in past and it doesn't remind me kindly let me know the way to set it proper;0
Why isn't this app getting downloaded There is some issue with the app It had been recommended to me by my buddy but this thing isn't getting installed on my phone;0
Why was I charged $1.49 for this app? I was charged 2/4/2020.;0
Monthly payments for a todo app? Not gonna happen, thank you.;0
Too hard to use;0
Lag all the time;0
What should I do if I want more sublists ?! There is no way ! 🙁;0
Scheduling reminder intervals does not work!!!!;0
This app just isnt for me;0
Usless;0
Can only put 5 tasks before having to pay;0
I just removed this app! I missed several events in the last couple of months because it did not notify me!!!!!;0
Subscription only. No outright purchase. Too bad. Seems like a nice app.;0
Used it until simple backup was premiumized. Restore wont work between different versions unless you modi-hack the file. Author would not tell you that you can do it though if you ask his help ! . Restore dont recognize my backup file at all so all my lists are basically inaccessible now. Will never install this again and I suggest anyone who values his data not to !;0
Very pricey;0
Has no sign in option only export and the file won't open, so unless you have an IT friend you lose your file which meant all the stuff I put in tasks has gotten lost. If the developer revolves this is I will edit this review.;0
The alarm doesn't work;0
Definitely I appropriate your hard work and this app different from all those big guys apps, but question is if someone lost the phone or uninstalled the app, what is the purpose this app?, So i'm just suggesting, > you can limit the how many task can be added by users without premium >Opt. In Ads for auto backup;0
I deleted a list but I still get alarms for one of the tasks in that list, even after restarting my phone.;0
Dont work, the best it got was the vibration notification worked. I can't get any sound at all from this app.;0
I removed this paid app. I missed about a dozen events over the few months I owned this. I would look at the app a few minutes after an event was supposed to pop up, and it showed that it had missed. I'm trying out Simple Calendar, which testing seems to work better.;0
Need to make more convinient I just set 3 time alarm for the task but it didnt work;0
I cant even get on thing on the opening page much less start a list??;0
Bad;0
A simple app that could not be more complicated to operate.;0
No hourly reminder.;0
This app is not the best.;0
Absolutely terrible. Most unless app I have downloaded, to date.;0
Always missing the notifications even when it is not optimized and restricted in background.;0
No good;0
Only get about half of the reminders;0
Awful hard to start, impossible to figure out;0
Would be nice if you could import tasks from other applications, but not only is that a problem, but importing from a previous version of Tasks is impossible too? Nevermind. I'll just stick to what I got.;0
Edit: I'm using this application many year since release. And i'm loved it and donate, Now you make this application subscription $15 a year? Really?? Not happy with that...;0
I do not like the functionality of the app. I found it is very easy to delete a sub list. But if you create a second list I could not figure out how to delete it after going through all settings. I also did not like the fact that you can only add one item within the sub list. Other people may be okay with these nuances, but for me it's not. I only use this app for about a half an hour and then deleted it.;0
Recurrent tasks don't work;0
Not good. Wasted time.;0
Can't rely for reminders. No alarm comes even if I select Alarm. Because of relying on this app I missed an important task.;0
there are better and simple other apps which provide automatic online sync or backup feature like Micr_oso_ft's to do, and many other. why people think this app easy, it's not. I donated on this app and wasted.;0
Over complicated;0
Extremely unintuitive.;0
Garbage. The one time I can't remember if i checked the notification for taking my medication or not, there was no way to go and see which days I checked it or not. What's the point of that?;0
Dear developers, thank you for deleting all my reminders after updating the app! It was not pleasant at all, believe me!;0
Loved for a while. One fine day my subtasks got deleted. It was in a task for which i didn't set any due date. Bad experience.;0
Don't use this unless you sync your tasks. The backup and restore functionality from one device to the next is bad.;0
It'hs just too complicate to use for me;0
pangit;0
Too complicated;0
Was really enjoying this & then the notifications just stopped which is a big part of what I needed the app for:( annoying, finding a new app for this now;0
Terrible app;0
Worst apk reminder not work;0
Doesn't sync to calendar;0
Well it's broken now. I haven't messed with any settings in or out of the app and now there's no alarm. It just vibrates. I checked and it all still has the alarms and correct sounds yet it only vibrates when it shows a reminder. Why do these reminder apps always break?;0
Used to work ok, now, something is skrewy. Now, if I restart my phone, EVERY SINGLE task comes up as a notification, never mind of when the tasks were/are due, and the schedule I set. Now, after I dismiss tasks, they pop up again, ignoring its schedule. Also, wish app could remember which day the task is for. If you have a daily task that you complete after midnight, it thinks you completed it early and won't remind you later that day. Finally, wish app opened to an overview of all lists.;0
There is no way to create repeated scheduled tasks. I already have Google calendar for what this does. Its nicer looking but I don't need what I already have. EDIT. in response: no it's not easy. And honestly, the app has so many more issues. Deleting things is difficult, but making mistakes in organization is easy. Organization is not great on this app. I don't like your app guys. I dont know who it's good for, but its not me. But I appreciate the slight on my post.;0
Loses task lists on Premium - Don't upgrade So annoyed. loved and recommended this app til I upgraded 2 weeks ago. Got a new phone & realised tasks weren't backed up to my GMail account (annoying). Copying the lists over wasn't easy either (annoying). Paid for the upgrade, have now lost 3 of my lists...vanished from menu. No reason, not deleted and not in deleted items. Can't find out how to sign out or cancel premium account. Use the basic option and don't change your phone!;0
Widget unresponsive. Boy, I am incredibly unlikely. I am the ONLY one to ever experience this! It must just be me.;0
The app no longer reminds me of tasks and keeps bringing up ones marked complete.;0
Not at all use ... Its not remainding with alarming then whats is the use of remainder app... Its only alarming while we open the app... Not usefull at all;0
Thanks, but it now has gone wrong being unable to alert and no alarm at all. Please advise if this app is still ok to keep!!!?;0
Terrible. I've missed so many reminders despite adding it to unmonitored apps and not being on power saver. I give up.;0
The star rating & my comment are only for the move capability. The order within the list can't be easily rearranged. Move to top and move to bottom is the only option. There's another move which tries to move the task to the same list if you have only one list. What is needed is a simple drag and drop of a task to a different order. The 2nd option is to have only 'Move' upon touch and hold, and then pop up a sub menu. This sub menu can have up / down arrow and other move choices.;0
I loved this app at first, but now when I change my task dates/times, it doesn't actually change them, and continues to alert me at the original time even though I've clearly changed it. It's very annoying.;0
Almost what i need, except there's no option to set a start & end time with reminder for the start. So it's useless (for me).;0
While swiping towards right the tasks are getting deleted. At least it should ask for confirmation whether the delete is happening accidentally or we really want to delete.;0
My alarm isn't ringing please help. Everything else is fine;0
It's just okay, it's too easy to delete tasks on accident and it puts it in backwards;0
"Good idea for an app, but I uninstalled due to overcomplicated interface. For example, there are 2 ""+"" symbols, neither of which are self-explanatory (is it for a sub list of main list or another sub list category. I'd prefer there to be words there to explain what they mean and, additionally, a description of what list you're working under after you enter a list. I need an app that's unobtrusive but yet daily I can easily view my to do lists and subgoals.";0
Reminder notification not on time for about an hour so it is inconvenient;0
It’s not that good as much as I thought before I downloaded it. It never sent me notifications or alarms. I missed my two events because of this. 😭😭;0
The 1st action the app wants is to name a list. What am I listing and why would I name it? What I'm looking for is a reminder with an alarm using the ringtones already on my phone to remind me of important events. This app doesnt seem to function that way. I dont know what I'd use this app for.;0
Not able to install on more than two devices. I found this frustrating as I had one phone stolen and another broke. Now I can’t download on my new phone because it’s already on the other with my main email. Does not allow another email. Not too pleased about this.;0
Looking as everyone else's very +ve reviews. I seem to be the odd one out but I didn't find it straightforward. It is too easy to delete a list (on my S9 at least) with even a slight bit of a swipe. Once deleted it is lost. Why not have a 'back' or 'undo' button? Personally I don't find the heading, group, list structure particularly straightforward although I've now got used to it.;0
Awesome app, the only missing thing is that you can only set a date, I would like to have buttons to remind me later on the day. Or on the next day, or next week. UPDATE: No what I meant, is that I want to say remind me today and not remind me at date today at specific time. UPDATE: I would then receive the notification, at a specific time 5 hours later or something that can be altered in the settings. And also I don't want to put in a date! Look at the app TickTick has exactly what I want. :);0
"I actually really like this app but one of the biggest features that needs to work properly for my routines is repeating reminders. I set reminds for monthly bills such as rent, and set it to repeat ""monthly"". But when I complete the task, it uncompletes itself the very next day WITHOUT setting the reminder to the next month. Basically if i set it to November 1st, it tries to remind me again, daily, on november 1st. It doesn't work. I love the app but the most important feature is broken sadly.";0
28 Oct 2018: same problem. Repeating tasks do not update and advance to next due date when completed. Checks it as done and then unchecks sometime at night with previous due date. 27 Oct 2018: After hearing back from the author, giving it another shot. Put two repeating tasks on it. See how it goes. 27 Oct 2018: This app didn't work as well for me. It would regularly uncheck tasks I'd completed or check tasks I'd not completed. The repeating task function didn't work well either.;0
It is not very flexible. It's a pain to make sub lists and quickly edit them. I wish when the app opened you see a list of all of your major tasks or a calendar. If these things are possible, maybe adding a tutorial feature when the app first downloads and opens would help streamline the experience.;0
"simple app, widget is bad (left side has a bar that ruins symmetry, also you cant remove the new task button), also, why can I change list color but cant change button color? would also be cool to preview what ""compact/cozy"" and whatnot settings do instead of having to select them one by one, leave settings, and go back in to change them again. all in all, its almost a 5 star app, but the nuissances ruin the experience a bit.";0
App is unable to manage Recurring Tasks. App has almost everything, but it fails on managing recurring task. After setting the task to be of Repeat type, marking task Completed for a specific day is marking entire task as completed..!!! And for this only reason, I had to uninstall. Please make necessary changes and inform.;0
Cancel means stop the action...not throw away all the notes I just made...sorry but this was suppse to save time not waste ideas and planning...poor comms from app on a normalized UI function. First go and really turned me off, could be lots more awesome, but things like this and not being able to recover the info quickly then...not acceptable when doing business tasks nowadays.;0
It was okay but when I tried to set a reminder for 15 minutes from now it said reminders set in the past will not show. That is extremely inconvenient and annoying . I tried setting it for 15 minutes from now but didn't work. Would have given five stars if it wasn't for this issue;0
Got it primarily for reminders. It has a lot of settings for how you want your alarms or notifications, but those are pretty useless when they don't work. Didn't get a single notification to remind me of the stuff I set up.;0
"Bad experience as the events created (Ex: Birthdays, Anniversaries, etc.) in Alarm mode is working only sometimes!! In such situations, the event is just turning ""Red"" (but Alarm is not ringing) as if i missed the event...!!";0
Without syncing to the cloud this todo app is unfortunately worthless. Love it otherwise and would have given it 4 or 5 stars. Please add sync since in my quest to find a good todo app this is the only one I've seen that doesn't sync anywhere between devices.;0
app maybe okay, but its very confusing to understand. I have tried about 30 min to set a simple task for a particular date, but it doesnt show up anywhere. So, i will keep looking for a more simplyfied app. Sorry.;0
i hate how you cannot open the app and see all your lists there. you have to have one open at all times and it does not show a list of your list on the home screen. deleting this app for this reason. too bad... the rest is great. but they need a home screen. they don't have one.;0
"trying to switch from wunderlist and the import option doesn't work or give any assistance to troubleshoot. I just get the message ""file not found"" with nothing else to say where it's looking for the file so I can get it in the right place.";0
Tasks that repeat more than once daily dont work, if you have something that is twice a day you have to have two separate tasks. If you leave a task pending until the following day and complete it, it will never work again.;0
This app sometimes missed important tasks and didn't notify.;0
"Not competent at scheduling. Recurring tasks are automatically ""completed"" if not checked by the scheduled time. There is no way to know if you missed it. The interface is pleasant though.";0
Liked the prioritization by dragging and the highlighting, but there does not seem to be a way to create recurring tasks. That's a deal -breaker for me. I'm uninstalling;0
I keep completing tasks, and the next day they open automatically again and the notification pops up. Its very irritating and confusing. What's the point of opening a completed task? Maybe you need to add an option to permanently close repeat tasks vs close them for that day;0
Due Date is wonky. I made a few items on my list and the due will not change from the current day. The due date worked on other items. I don't need another app to work around.;0
Decent app but does NOT seem to be able to sync with my google calendar. Without that it is pretty useless to me. I like that sub-tasks are listed as an indent to the main task not as a seperate task.;0
i like how its organized and how many choices and the customization. but, i set alarms and keep in mind, i have all permissions on, and it didnt go on my screen, so i missed a very important meeting.;0
To Do list apps, like this one, are not useful without the capability of using recurring tasks. Too bad because the interface is otherwise well done.;0
so far the app is great. would get 5 stars if it had a tabbing feature where you can side over to each task name instead of having to go to the menu button to switch.;0
Had high hopes for this because it had everything I wanted but the completed tasks that I keep putting as completed come back the next day which is just irritating. Have tried all the settings to get of it but I can't and can't be bothered to persevere anymore;0
No subscription tank you. Please full price. I no lack forever.;0
it was pretty good on my old phone. then when everything was ported to my new one, the app came, but not the lists I'd made. what's the point of that?! I've deleted it.;0
I love nearly everything about this app, but it eats up the battery on my phone like crazy because it is always running in the background.;0
Using this apps, i can guarantee you will never remember one single task. Needs more improvements to be classified under reminders category.;0
PLEASE make a home screen where it shows your active main tasks allowing you to just press and view them without having to click the top left button snd select. this would be VERY convenient. thank you.;0
I found the white text against many of the colors very difficult to read.;0
Would like to assign priority rating to each task (A=do it soon, B=do it later, C=low priority, Z=take it off the list);0
While changing list, by scrolling right to left, task get deleted, it's very confusing;0
why would tasks be tabs instead of a list? the whole screen is empty and you make us scroll tabs :O;0
Switching from one list to another stinks. Otherwise helpful;0
No easy way to import/export tasks in a compatible format (e.g. Google Tasks);0
Not sure why everyone's given this such high reviews. The reminders don't work for me, which makes the whole point of having this app useless;0
I had a reminder set with a certain sound & it never went off;0
Does not have a recurring task feature. Useless for me.;0
I really want to love this app but it won't even let me select PM so its constantly telling me its past the due date, which makes the app very useless to me.;0
Recurence tasks does not work properly, otherwise I would give 4 starts.;0
I don't understand why it's not letting me type in it. It gets hanged everytime. I meant that amake ora onek birokto kortese....sorry I speak only Bahamian;0
"you should have name to change date with ""yesterday"" ""today"" ""tomorrow"" (not number) on widget view";0
Seriously? How did it get a 4.8? I can't even find an add button anywhere??? Unless i go to the top left corner? Nah. Not for me;0
I like the Apple task app way better.;0
YOUR CONDESCENDING ATTITUDE IS NOT HELPING YOR CASE. There is a sublist reorder but NOTHING for the MAIN LIST. THERE IS NO SORT OF ANY KIND says sort by DO DATE or lets you PICK WHAT TO SORT BY, A LOGIC CHOICE. Completed tasks NEED TO CHANGE IMIEDIATELY so you KNOW IT'S COMPLETED & next month IS SET. I DIDN'T SAY IT WASN'T SIMPLE. The INTERFACE is NOT VERY INTUITIVE. I DID LOOK AT HELP & THERE is LITTLE FOR THE MAIN LIST. YOU ARE very IRRITATING so I am going to try other choices.;0
Can't put cute stickers on them no cuteness on phone;0
Not Working On Xperia E1!;0
Too complicated to save and add.;0
cant complete subtasks through widget .. huge turn off;0
skips reminders until I pick up and check my phone. then they go off😖;0
Wish I could sync it across multiple devices :(;0
Setting am/pm is not easy;0
Nice app for remainders;0
I uninstalled the app because it sends my phone info to the developer;0
Feel like can add calender;0
I'd like to know how to create home screen widgets.;0
just started using it, but so far so good;0
Keeps me on top of things;0
Dont this app have repeat task feature?;0
Useless. No nesting;0
Hard to use;0
not so good;0

It worked for the first week. Now I can't add a task without it crashing.;0
In this app reminder doesn't work;0
It doesn't ring to notify me;0
No Google tasks integration.;0
No custom repeat frequency...;0
Does this app truly have reminders?? It refused to remind me of my event;0
Please make it available as a widget.;0
This was OK for a few days but now  when I open it it is just a blank screen and I have lost all my  tasks. Very annoying as these were important reminders !;0
It’s not that good as much as I thought before I downloaded it. It never sent me notifications or alarms. I missed my two events because of this. 😭😭;0

It was okay but when I tried to set a reminder for 15 minutes from now it said reminders set in the past will not show. That is extremely inconvenient and annoying . I tried setting it for 15 minutes from now but didn't work. Would have given five stars if it wasn't for this issue;0
Tasks that repeat more than once daily dont work, if you have something that is twice a day you have to have two separate tasks. If you leave a task pending until the following day and complete it, it will never work again.;0
Decent app but does NOT seem to be able to sync with my google calendar. Without that it is pretty useless to me. I like that sub-tasks are listed as an indent to the main task not as a seperate task.;0
I keep completing tasks, and the next day they open automatically again and the notification pops up. Its very irritating and confusing. What's the point of opening a completed task? Maybe you need to add an option to permanently close repeat tasks vs close them for that day;0
PLEASE make a home screen where it shows your active main tasks allowing you to just press and view them without having to click the top left button snd select. this would be VERY convenient. thank you.;0
"trying to switch from wunderlist and the import option doesn't work or give any assistance to troubleshoot. I just get the message ""file not found"" with nothing else to say where it's looking for the file so I can get it in the right place.";0
i hate how you cannot open the app and see all your lists there. you have to have one open at all times and it does not show a list of your list on the home screen. deleting this app for this reason. too bad... the rest is great. but they need a home screen. they don't have one.;0
app maybe okay, but its very confusing to understand. I have tried about 30 min to set a simple task for a particular date, but it doesnt show up anywhere. So, i will keep looking for a more simplyfied app. Sorry.;0
Wish I could sync it across multiple devices :(;0
I love nearly everything about this app, but it eats up the battery on my phone like crazy because it is always running in the background.;0
Recurence tasks does not work properly, otherwise I would give 4 starts.;0
stupid auto correct;0
cant complete subtasks through widget .. huge turn off;0
Using this apps, i can guarantee you will never remember one single task. Needs more improvements to be classified under reminders category.;0
skips reminders until I pick up and check my phone. then they go off😖;0
le partage est tres nul.... cest juste un texte envoyé a l autre...;0
It is not very flexible. It's a pain to make sub lists and quickly edit them. I wish when the app opened you see a list of all of your major tasks or a calendar. If these things are possible, maybe adding a tutorial feature when the app first downloads and opens would help streamline the experience.;0
I found the white text against many of the colors very difficult to read.;0
I'd like to know how to create home screen widgets.;0
not so good;0
"Not competent at scheduling. Recurring tasks are automatically ""completed"" if not checked by the scheduled time. There is no way to know if you missed it. The interface is pleasant though.";0
complicated;0
I uninstalled the app because it sends my phone info to the developer;0
just started using it, but so far so good;0
"simple app, widget is bad (left side has a bar that ruins symmetry, also you cant remove the new task button), also, why can I change list color but cant change button color? would also be cool to preview what ""compact/cozy"" and whatnot settings do instead of having to select them one by one, leave settings, and go back in to change them again. all in all, its almost a 5 star app, but the nuissances ruin the experience a bit.";0
Awesome app, the only missing thing is that you can only set a date, I would like to have buttons to remind me later on the day. Or on the next day, or next week. UPDATE: No what I meant, is that I want to say remind me today and not remind me at date today at specific time. UPDATE: I would then receive the notification, at a specific time 5 hours later or something that can be altered in the settings. And also I don't want to put in a date! Look at the app TickTick has exactly what I want. :);0
so far the app is great. would get 5 stars if it had a tabbing feature where you can side over to each task name instead of having to go to the menu button to switch.;0
it was pretty good on my old phone. then when everything was ported to my new one, the app came, but not the lists I'd made. what's the point of that?! I've deleted it.;0
"Bad experience as the events created (Ex: Birthdays, Anniversaries, etc.) in Alarm mode is working only sometimes!! In such situations, the event is just turning ""Red"" (but Alarm is not ringing) as if i missed the event...!!";0
Does not have a recurring task feature. Useless for me.;0
"you should have name to change date with ""yesterday"" ""today"" ""tomorrow"" (not number) on widget view";0
Can't put cute stickers on them no cuteness on phone;0
To Do list apps, like this one, are not useful without the capability of using recurring tasks. Too bad because the interface is otherwise well done.;0
Got it primarily for reminders. It has a lot of settings for how you want your alarms or notifications, but those are pretty useless when they don't work. Didn't get a single notification to remind me of the stuff I set up.;0
No easy way to import/export tasks in a compatible format (e.g. Google Tasks);0
Liked the prioritization by dragging and the highlighting, but there does not seem to be a way to create recurring tasks. That's a deal -breaker for me. I'm uninstalling;0
28 Oct 2018: same problem. Repeating tasks do not update and advance to next due date when completed. Checks it as done and then unchecks sometime at night with previous due date. 27 Oct 2018: After hearing back from the author, giving it another shot. Put two repeating tasks on it. See how it goes. 27 Oct 2018: This app didn't work as well for me. It would regularly uncheck tasks I'd completed or check tasks I'd not completed. The repeating task function didn't work well either.;0
Looking as everyone else's very +ve reviews. I seem to be the odd one out but I didn't find it straightforward. It is too easy to delete a list (on my S9 at least) with even a slight bit of a swipe. Once deleted it is lost. Why not have a 'back' or 'undo' button? Personally I don't find the heading, group, list structure particularly straightforward although I've now got used to it.;0
Seriously? How did it get a 4.8? I can't even find an add button anywhere??? Unless i go to the top left corner? Nah. Not for me;0
Without syncing to the cloud this todo app is unfortunately worthless. Love it otherwise and would have given it 4 or 5 stars. Please add sync since in my quest to find a good todo app this is the only one I've seen that doesn't sync anywhere between devices.;0
I had a reminder set with a certain sound & it never went off;0
Due Date is wonky. I made a few items on my list and the due will not change from the current day. The due date worked on other items. I don't need another app to work around.;0
It worked for the first week. Now I can't add a task without it crashing.;0
In this app reminder doesn't work;0
It doesn't ring to notify me;0
No Google tasks integration.;0
No custom repeat frequency...;0
Does this app truly have reminders?? It refused to remind me of my event;0
I love this app so much. This is the app that I search for a long time. BUT, the widget sometimes error. It show the tasks that already checked being unchecked. When I clicked it, the app just show white screen or freezing. After several minutes, it became normal again. Even though it will be normal again, of course that's so annoying! When I'm in rush to create task, the freeze often makes me forget about the things that I want to write. Please, fix this! Thank you.;1
Really excellent for keeping track of daily routines or one time events far off. I would appreciate some options on when daily tasks reset and that the task would reset the next day if I missed it but these are small complaints. This has really improved my quality of life.;1
Nice organizational app with lots of lists. I do wish it would save a task when you add it to a list rather than when you hit the button to save the whole list, I've lost some lists I wrote because I pressed back instead of save by accident. In general love the app though.;1
"A task which is set to ""repeat"" should NOT mark it as done for all the future instances too. Hi guys, hope the dev team is listening. There's an issue , that suppose I set a task to repeat daily, the app correctly reminds me to do the task for the first time , it's ok , I do the task and mark it as done! Then the app marks whole task to be done! And the ""repeat"" functionality makes no sense then . I like interface of the app , hence prompted to inform you about this issue.";1
I finally found this app after much searching. It's easy to use & has color choices to differentiate lists from one another. It would be even better if I could post my current working lists open on my home page for easier reference. I have multiple lists & things to remember lists going all the time that I need to refer back to. Any chance of adding this feature?;1
Clean layout and does what it says without egregious permissions. Two thumbs. Unfortunately I can't find information about the app's functions even within the help menu: - Recurring tasks do not appear to reset if they are not complete. I can't figure out how to make them reset even if they are incomplete. - I can't make my recurring items show up on the calendar. - I can't manually set the reset time since my tasks might be completed between 8pm and 3 am. - View previous recurring tasks.;1
Great app. Would love a general page view of all lists and recurring items ie every weekend items that can be ticked off as completed but not removed in a week and would like alternate view such as in mind map view all the lists and sub lists for quick visual reference. Overall love the app and it's easy to use. Definately recommend.;1
So...im yet another searching for a wunderlist replacement and this app almost has me, except I cant link my partner to my lists! Thats the only thing im missing. Otherwise its lovely. Really really enjoy that you can see the note on a task without opening it. Its just there. Great job with the app. Just cant give it a perfect 5 without being able to link with another person.;1
So far I love the app. It allows you to have multiple lists. I like the different colour options for each list. The sub task section is useful, especially since you can see it under the main task.;1
I really love the app, the design and functionality. It's just that, I hope there is a way to better navigate the different tasks. They are together on the left menu with the calendar. Calendar is not even a task.;1
Very nice app. It will be great if the app includes 'number of reminders' in reminder setting instead of setting reminder after first alert. Eg. If user wants 3 reminders after gap of specified intervals (15 min/ 1 hour) for a task, then user will be free from extending reminder as per current way given in app. Thanks.;1
One of the best attempts at something that is always done surprisingly badly. Desperately needs a web interface so you don't have to do everything on your phone. Also needs to allow you to set reminder defaults. Good but could be better.;1
I could not find a save button. I had problem adding a task then adding a sub task. One this was sorted I have managed to have tasks and sub tasks. Would like to be able to sort list alphabetically.;1
Best one out there. However, I would like to see a swipe feature on the widget to archive or delete as oppose to a button to delete to prevent accidental touching. Turning off auto hide is a bit long winded to delete each task. 5stars if this gets added.;1
I'm using the basic so some questions may be unfair. All I know is its an easy app to use and exactly what I was looking for. I gave it 4 stars and not 5 only because it would be nice if I could sync it with my calendar to send me reminders.;1
Only issue I have encountered so far is that it doesn't seem to work for meetings that occur every two weeks. Works on the first reminder but then doesn't update to the next occurrence.;1
Helpful and easy to use. Really good app for students or people who struggle with remembering tasks they have to get done.;1
Update: developer responded quickly with explanation. So impressed that I'm trying it anyway. ___ Original review: Couldn't move onto SD card, so didn't have the space to keep it and try it properly.;1
Gtasks became impossible to use. This app had lots of great reviews and I can see why. So far I love it. It is so easy to send my grocery list etc to my husband.;1
It's terrific. So flexible. So organized. Wish it had a web app, but that is the only drawback.;1
So far so good I like the simple clean layout and I purchased the premium so loving being able to jot down on either device would love a grocery list but I'll figure it out as I go;1
Very versatile App that keep me organized with the ability to group multiple categorized tasking lists. Easy to manipulate on the fly and mark off completed tasks.;1
Easy to use App, easy to move items up and down the list and organize categories. Like this app better than the Wunderlist app I used to have.;1
Easy to use interface and very helpful. Just wish it had a pin up on the home screen so I could directly look at my list;1
Mr.Stephan, Just now I've installed it .I really appreciate your effort to respond to each comment and solve a problem wherever noticed . Keep it up !;1
Amazing app, only wish that when you search it would also look in sub task. Also would like Tags for both task and sub taks;1
It has really helped me stay organised and on top of my to do tasks! Simple to use and effective.;1
I love it but theres one thing you should add. A note pad for notes for extra.;1
So far Tasks has been easy to use for my todo and task list needs. It looks like a good replacement for Wonderlist.;1
It's been really useful so far for remembering key things I need to get done at specific times.;1
It is very good application, it is easy to use, helpful for organizing my job tasks;1
It works well as I have check all things to do. But the reminder or alarm is not working;1
Works well but doesn't make a sound when it alerts me and I wish it would.;1
Great in its simplicity, minus side is disability to back up data.;1
Very useful organizer app, easy to set up and use. Would definitely recommend;1
Easy to use, prioritize and set reminders to get things done.;1
Better than wunderlist except I can't add a screen cap or image in notes for each task... please add would make this perfect;1
Very handy to jot down task or projects so I don't forget or so I do the higher priority tasks first;1
Pretty good overall, sometimes not as intuitive as I'd like but defo gets the job done;1
Just started using. Can't figure out yet how to delete completed tasks instead of moving or crossing them off.;1
Very Good App. Actually works. Helps in organising daily routine.;1
Having a list of things to buy with items linked to tasks would be great;1
Easy to use. Perfect need to make a to do list;1
This application is worth INSTALLING. It REALLY helps you to remain ORGANISED without any stress. Humble Suggestion: It would have been more convenient, if you had provided 2-3 reminders possible WITHOUT MANDATORY SNOOZE. To understand this concept very clearly, you are REQUESTED to study SnPlan application. All the best.;1
Good. 1. Printing the tasks may be considered. 2. Displaying all the tasks at one go may also be considered..;1
I've been using your app for awhile now & love it, but for the 1st time today everything I did since last night is not there & I do a lot of personal & work things. Can you please help me with this problem?;1
I'm a new user. Like the simplicity and that it doesn't bully me to work to a deadline. Would like ability to see all lists together.;1
The AP has helped me keep abreast of all tasks and supported 100 % completion;1
It's great for to do lists and categorizing them.;1
Just started using... Looks better than other apps... time changing to be focused more... will revisit after using few days... Thanks team.;1
Hi Steve. Is it possible to add voice reminder notifications in your app using google TTS tool?;1
Started using this app for a about a month now and it is very helpful in keeping track of my to do list;1
Not bad, pretty basic but its helpful;1
Reply to Developer: I'll just say, thanks for all you do!! I think my biggest complaint, and it's a very small one, is that the sublists feature is slightly confusing. I don't love that it creates a list that is adjacent to the original list and not beneath/inside of it. Maybe I just don't get how it should be used. I would also love multiple tiers for subtasks instead of just one. That's all I have for now. Thank you for the excellent (AD-FREE!) app!;1
So far so good. Been using this app for a month now and it is so convenient and intuitive. Exactly what I needed BUT I will ask for one fix that is really important for reminders and alarms when traveling: Every alarm or reminder needs an option for what to do when you change time zones. Should the alarm go off based on the time zone when you made it (A business meeting) or same time regardless of location? (Take my meds) I dont want to miss a business call because of travel.;1
I like the way this app looks. Helps me feel I'm achieving things!;1
"A help function would be helpful. Or if there there already is a help function, making it easy to find, would be helpful! How to make a list of things to do is not self evident. I thought I was making a list of things to do, only to find I made a title or catagory of a list of things to do (hopefully that makes sense). Only had this for a few minutes and there is a learning curve for most software so will see how it goes. Aha! Found the help function. Thanks. I also discovered how to delete the ""categories"" I started, instead of a list of tasks. At this time, this app has been helpful. Upgrading to another star.";1
Good for shopping lists and To Do's!;1
Very helpful when it comes to organizing;1
Helps stay organized, wish it kept track daily;1
Easy to use and does exactly what it says.;1
"I didn't see an option for smart lists like ""today"". Is there a way to put meditate a on a folder? I've been investigating options for my replacement of Wunderlist since I had to move off that.😡 I would also like a way to set up dependencies not necessarily a Gant chart but Tasks that are moved out if one has to move out that they are dependent on. Thanks just still trying it out.";1
Great help! It actually replaced the little papers + pens...;1
I only wish for 2 things. Google tasks sync and allowing custom snooze times;1
I'm having the same issue as Jackie Hutton 28/04/20. Repeating daily reminders are no longer working and are being missed due to marking as done from the notification. This wasn't an issue before, and once rectified, the app would definitely be worthy of five stars again. *Edited to add: If it was an issue with my device, surely the problem would have been there from when I first downloaded the app? It's an issue that wasn't there previously and has only been there for the last week or so.;1
Really good for organisibg and very deatailed.Love it!;1
It's the best replacement for Wunderlist I've managed to find that isn't trying to map out my entire life. I had a bit of user-error when using the widget, but once I figured that out I updated my review from 3 to 4 stars. The widget does look a little pixelated, but that may be my phone's fault. Once list sharing is possible this will be my main list-making app! Keep up the good work, and thank you for making such a simple yet pretty app! =);1
I like it so far. Found this since Wunderlist is ending and I refuse to use the one they recommend. This seems to do everything Wunderlist did. I like the color options for lists and I've been happily surprised with this app. The only downfall is they don't offer list sharing and it looks like they're going to charge for that in the future. If they make that free, it will 5 stars all the way.;1
Really love this app, it was exactly what I needed, I would like the ability to be able to check off sub lists while viewing the widget. Currently have to tap on the top of the widget to open the app to be able to do so.;1
Stephen, I've got to remove a star. I've been hoping you will address the issue that recurring tasks, once marked completed, don't go onto the next iteration- instead, they stay marked as completed and don't repeat as needed. I'm missing out on reminders for my daughter's medication if I don't remember to go uncheck the box after marking as complete. I know you are working hard & I want to support you, but I may have to go back to using Samsung reminders (ugh) since they don't have this issue.;1
it does its job and its very responsive. i use it to keep track of the games i want to buy for my collection. i like how it shows the date and time of when your task was completed. i think the interface could do with looking a little less cluttered and a little more minimalist, but overall, the app is fast and easy to use;1
All seems to be good,especially the color changing one...but we dont have option to view day/week/month wise completed task. I also wanted a punishment to popup if the task is not done at the right time;1
"I like: * the way it separates lists (""sub lists"") horizontally, and I can switch between them conveniently with swipes, though I tend to accidentally delete tasks when trying to switch lists * I value the convenience of swipe to delete the most * being able to quick add tasks from the main screen, removes one extra tap step * being able to highlight important tasks, but wish it would automatically pin them to the top. Feature I wish most for: Image attachments. Idea: Location-based reminders?";1
This app looks great and most of the functions seem to be very practical. There isn't any Windows or browser-based version for usage on a computer, is it? If not, is something in planning? As Wunderlist will be shut down, I'm in search for a good alternative, and this app WITH a sync function would be amazing! Edit: Showing the calendar view in a widget would be fantastic as well.;1
Wish you could delete completed lists. Super easy and fast to use. Good way to plan the day. I love you can color code the lists to make sure each one feels different;1
Works great at keeping me organized. I have not had it long so I will have to explore the features. Update-New phone. I can now use the microphone to add tasks. This app is just smart enough. I use it as my own personal to do list separate from Google Tasks which I use for work. It's simple with just enough features and not all the predictive noise threaded through all Google apps.;1
I really loved this app. It has everything I wanted. But I feel like there is still room for improvement in this app, it's my personal opinion though, It will be better if you could add a screen for the heat map and that heat map would be colored on the days when user did at least one task, another one could be letting user add notes for subtasks also. 🙏;1
Haven't come across a better app if it's type. It's not a project management tool but you can have a list in your reminder! It's probably a big leap but if i could share the task list with somebody without exporting that would be cool. The notification, repeat, export control, is brilliant. Really helps me organise my home tasks without being frustratingly intrusive and distracting. I've tried a lot of applications, this is second to none!;1
Simplistic and good, widget is nice but i wish we could also control the transparency of the entire widget by just that of the most items and their backgrounds Edit : Thanks for the reply steve but what i want to change is the transparency of the color which we select for the list, which is at the top and left side of the widget, I tried but couldn't adjust its transparency;1
This is the best app I've found for getting everyday organised. Simple to use and intuitive. The one big drawback is that its storage sits on your local device. You can't register an account and use cloud storage, so if your local device fails you lose all your data and you can't sync with other devices. Apart from that, great.;1
Really useful app. Would give 5 stars if you could do multiple reminders and set your own snooze times. For instance have a reminder 2 days before then also when due. But I suppose just being able to set your own snooze times would cure that. The custom snooze times in settings is too limited. Minimally useful for my needs. Again love the app but need more customization with the snooze function.;1
To do list works good but it is no idiot proof. Developer needs to add more walk through instructions at start when the app is downloaded. When people commit on issues- the developer replies offended- but the developer did not make a idiot proof way of solving these problems that a newbie with little patience would have- instead they lash out - its not the user's fault- its the developer fault for not understanding the concept of idiot proofing a sound product- face it-people don't read!;1
I wish I could give it 5 stars. Only thing missing is a Windows/Linux app for syncing, which I can't do without, and that's the only thing keeping me away. I would happily pay for that feature. If you just need an Android app, no need to look elsewhere. It has everything you can ask for. The UI is great, and very intuitive.;1
It's a good app for task reminder but it still needs some thing more. One needs to go into the menu to switch to the lists no matter which list has an upcoming task. It should have option to show the mix of tasks from all lists in tiles/widgets on app home interface. I really like the snooze option, quite straight away.;1
Great task and project management app. User friendly and versatile. Lists and sub lists work well for most to do list requirements. Would just recommend to developers to introduce a couple of improvements... 1) there should be a difference between the date you plan to do a task and its deadline/due date. 2) would be great to be able to add a description and deadline to a sub list thereby creating little projects.;1
I like it but wish I could add a friend to the list so we can edit together;1
I really liked this app, however I have downloaded it yesterday and created tasks which repeats daily but it always shows tasks date 30 March. It was just the date I created it, it repeats daily so the dates should change too. It feels as if I am checking undone tasks from the past. Even in the calander view these tasks are not added to 31 March. It's annoying me. Please do something about it.;1
Great app! You can put various tasks into categories, set a task to repeat, add notes etc. It's very helpful in terms of keeping organized. The only downside so far is that the alarm for a task doesn't always go off at the exact time. It sometimes goes off anything between 1-6 min after the set time.;1
Definitely helps me to stay organized a little easier. I personally use it in conjunction with an old fashioned pen and paper when I have a lot to get done in a day. The only complaint I have with it is that I wish I could add additional reminders for the tasks instead of having to choose a reminder time based off of a due date I set. Other than that it's great and easy to use.;1
"The homescreen widget has 2-3 bad bugs on my Nokia 6.1. On the other hand, the app is very versatile - doesn't force me into any particular way of using it. It's so well done that I'm using it even for my non-""TODO"" notes. I've dropped specialized notetaking apps like Google Keep and Evernote because ""Tasks"" is better. The ""quick add"" feature is surprisingly useful. The author is responsive and polite.";1
Quick to learn and easy to use.;1
LOVE THIS APP! It has helped me alot for about a week and it works really well! I also like how you don't NEED to have premium to use the app!the only thing I would change is that I should he able to set it to a daliy list so everyday ot resets so I cn make a list to lose weight. Other then that great app!!;1
For some reason I can't edit my other review on the phone, or if I can it's not clear how. Lists are not in an intuitive place imo, so I missed them entirely, resulting in that erroneous post. If this supported arbitrarily nested task levels I'd give it five stars, but I'm definitely going to use this. R.I.P. Wunderlist;1
The app is really helpful, and organized;1
Really good! I feel it's lacking a dashboard with overall info. Edit: To-do, Accomplished, due, upcoming tasks would be interesting to see in pie chart;1
My go to tasks app. Happy to finally see a premium payment because you deserve money for this thing, but immediately saddened that it's subscription only! I get why, but please add a one time payment option too for those of us who don't want to deal with such things.;1
This has been a game changer for me. The only ability lacking from the widget is the ability to manipulate and move tasks, and add new lists. Carry over tasks I need to move from in the app. It takes time, but isn't a deal breaker.;1
Nice user experience. Would be helpful if able to sync with Gmail account;1
Great 👌 easy to use on n Samsung Galaxy note.;1
Pretty good app! Will recommend over others.;1
It's a good application to keep you on track;1
Thanks for your quick correspondence. I understand how the application's progress is limited due to resources, and hope that this will improve for all involved with time. I know times are tough for many worldwide, which means funding, now more than before, is harder to come by. All the best. Cheers.;1
So far so good, app is really fun to use and easy to add tasks on the fly;1
Great app but there is still for improvment until reaches the standards of the beloved Wunderlist. Edit as answer: there is nothing wrong with the app, but once one could use Wunderlist, well, that is a 5 stars. Hard to reach it. The most important thing is well out of reach for a personal project: the web interface and the multiplatform concept. Certainly other details, but as you know Wunderlist is deceased so I can't go back and make a side by side comparison. Note that I don't do the silly thing of rate what I don't like with 1 and what I like with 5. Between 1 and 5 there is the 2,3 and 4 and they should be used. A four is a very good rate. A 5 is for something which is truly unbeatable, unique, the best.;1
Good way for organizing tasks;1
Very easy to use once you understand the difference between the list name and the actual task name. You place various tasks into whatever lists you create.;1
Good for a shopping list;1
If you like a simple app to get the job done...this is it.;1
Super;1
I could not find a save button. I had problem adding a task then adding a sub task. One this was sorted I have managed to have tasks and sub tasks. Would like to be able to sort list alphabetically.;1
Good;1
I could use this application to categorize my short and long terms goals. I appreciate that, Thanks.;1
everything is good but sometimes i dont get notifications, the other lists do but one doesn't;1
Great app. Easy to use and very useful. My only wish is that it interacted with Google assistant so that I could add tasks with voice. I drive alot and I tend to think of things to add.;1
Works well. My big complaint is that for repeated items, the date does not update after you mark it completed. I have tasks that are meant to be done every 3 days that still say due May 14th Even after marking them complete. Fix this and I will give 5 stars. LG V40 thinQ;1
Keeps me on track.;1
Really helpful app. But it would be great if you guys add lock feature for individual entry. And make the backup feature in such a way so that if i uninstall and then install it again i require a pin to unlock the locked entry. Also if possible add the pin on notification option.;1
Of all the check list apps I've tried out, this one is the best organized, and it's customizable without being overly complicated.;1
When I buy a product on the list and touch the item that I bought, I simply wish to see a line through it, and it is that deleted item along with all other deleted items that I wish to keep forever so that when time comes again, I can touch the deleted item and simply remove the line strikethrough as an item to purchase again, so it is the deleted items I wish to keep forever.;1
I wish i can use hand writing;1
Nice organizational app with lots of lists. I do wish it would save a task when you add it to a list rather than when you hit the button to save the whole list, I've lost some lists I wrote because I pressed back instead of save by accident. In general love the app though.;1
Helpful and easy to use. Really good app for students or people who struggle with remembering tasks they have to get done.;1
Big help as I always have mobile phone with me;1
I have it four stars because the app is amazing but there is room for inprovement And that would be the app to have a calender which shows on which date I competed what tasks.;1
I like that I can make different lists and sublists of tasks and it's easy to move something from one list to another or cross something off. The one thing it's missing is that if I have a list called Today and one called Tomorrow it doesn't automatically change where the tasks are. Like if I have a task on Today and don't get to do it I'd love for it to show up in my Tomorrow list tomorrow. Otherwise it's easy to use and I also love that there is a place to put notes for each task item.;1
It does what it says rather nicely. Advanced reminders are nice. Easy to use.;1
Very helpful in organizing my life;1
Very helpful when it comes to organizing;1
Really helps to know when tasks are completed. It would be a solid 5 if, when you shared say with google drive, that the Completed DATES would transcribe in the transfer. Major reason for chosing this app was knowing when something was accomplished. Otherwise a great piece of software. Very functional in task management.;1
It would have been better if it used voice typing..... I will change to 5 stars as soon as they take action.... Otherwise it's awesome!!;1
This has everything I'm looking for from a UI perspective except one key thing: the ability to invite someone else to add/complete list items with you. It's the function Wunderlist fulfilled for us and I've been looking for a replacement ever since they were bought by MS. Add it, and it will be the dream list app I want!;1
This is a really cool app to plan your day through out...super colourful..but I found something bad....that is the remainders are not working properly.. please work on it.. otherwise it it super cool... EDIT : Thanks for your reply sir....I have tried all the ways to make it work but still it is not working..;1
Very easy to use, good;1
Amazing app, only wish that when you search it would also look in sub task. Also would like Tags for both task and sub taks;1
So far so good! Great app!;1
Amazing app;1
Easy to handle.;1
i think its over all a good app!;1
So far so good I like the simple clean layout and I purchased the premium so loving being able to jot down on either device would love a grocery list but I'll figure it out as I go;1
It helps me complete the task I wanted to do. It also reminds me on what to do if I ever forgot something. 👍👌;1
good app . if you could add priority input at quick add level it would be wonderful or else . if multitask could be added priority ar 1 go would be good;1
Easy to use. Perfect need to make a to do list;1
Simple and very helpful;1
Best Todo list I've tried so far,think I'll keep this one;1
Using it for the past week. So far, it's great.;1
It's terrific. So flexible. So organized. Wish it had a web app, but that is the only drawback.;1
Works perfectly. Helping heaps to manage my day.;1
This application is worth INSTALLING. It REALLY helps you to remain ORGANISED without any stress. Humble Suggestion: It would have been more convenient, if you had provided 2-3 reminders possible WITHOUT MANDATORY SNOOZE. To understand this concept very clearly, you are REQUESTED to study SnPlan application. All the best.;1
Really excellent for keeping track of daily routines or one time events far off. I would appreciate some options on when daily tasks reset and that the task would reset the next day if I missed it but these are small complaints. This has really improved my quality of life.;1
I love this app so much. This is the app that I search for a long time. BUT, the widget sometimes error. It show the tasks that already checked being unchecked. When I clicked it, the app just show white screen or freezing. After several minutes, it became normal again. Even though it will be normal again, of course that's so annoying! When I'm in rush to create task, the freeze often makes me forget about the things that I want to write. Please, fix this! Thank you.;1
So far I love the app. It allows you to have multiple lists. I like the different colour options for each list. The sub task section is useful, especially since you can see it under the main task.;1
Good, so far;1
I kinda love this app but the only problem that I've face now is that i want to have my task on my pc and i think it would be great if you could put some accounts so that we can easily sort our task in any devices that we are into;1
Hi Steve. Is it possible to add voice reminder notifications in your app using google TTS tool?;1
I love it but theres one thing you should add. A note pad for notes for extra.;1
Helps me remember things that I need to do.;1
How can I change the language??;1
This app is so far the best todo list app. It has almost everything I want but currently if I complete a subtask it doesn't add up to the main percentage of menu list (only shows percentage in absolute value) unless I complete all the subtask under a task. I really need it to show the percentages like this (i.e: 90.5%) if I am unable to complete some of the sub tasks;1
Practical;1
I really love the app, the design and functionality. It's just that, I hope there is a way to better navigate the different tasks. They are together on the left menu with the calendar. Calendar is not even a task.;1
Not bad, pretty basic but its helpful;1
It sucks and it awesome;1
Helps stay organized, wish it kept track daily;1
Nice;1
Helpful with reminding me of things that need to be done;1
I've been using your app for awhile now & love it, but for the 1st time today everything I did since last night is not there & I do a lot of personal & work things. Can you please help me with this problem?;1
yeah!🤩;1
Great and fabulous. Helps me to manage and organise my tasks;1
So far working great...;1
Clean layout and does what it says without egregious permissions. Two thumbs. Unfortunately I can't find information about the app's functions even within the help menu: - Recurring tasks do not appear to reset if they are not complete. I can't figure out how to make them reset even if they are incomplete. - I can't make my recurring items show up on the calendar. - I can't manually set the reset time since my tasks might be completed between 8pm and 3 am. - View previous recurring tasks.;1
Really good app.;1
Very handy tool.;1
Useful one;1
Just started using. Can't figure out yet how to delete completed tasks instead of moving or crossing them off.;1
Update: developer responded quickly with explanation. So impressed that I'm trying it anyway. ___ Original review: Couldn't move onto SD card, so didn't have the space to keep it and try it properly.;1
Having a list of things to buy with items linked to tasks would be great;1
It's a very good app but only needs some changes.......;1
Great reminder for me! Love it;1
Only issue I have encountered so far is that it doesn't seem to work for meetings that occur every two weeks. Works on the first reminder but then doesn't update to the next occurrence.;1
Works as expected;1
Quick to learn and easy to use.;1
Can be better, can be made more attractive and everything else is good;1
I like the way this app looks. Helps me feel I'm achieving things!;1
Very Good App. Actually works. Helps in organising daily routine.;1
Its fine;1
I like it but wish I could add a friend to the list so we can edit together;1
Just started using... Looks better than other apps... time changing to be focused more... will revisit after using few days... Thanks team.;1
I'm using the basic so some questions may be unfair. All I know is its an easy app to use and exactly what I was looking for. I gave it 4 stars and not 5 only because it would be nice if I could sync it with my calendar to send me reminders.;1
Simple and to the point;1
Does exactly what I want from a TODO list app. 5* if you go back to the tab view for lists so the names are always visible (so I don't need to click the menu to open a list).;1
Good app;1
Started using this app for a about a month now and it is very helpful in keeping track of my to do list;1
Good for shopping lists and To Do's!;1
Easy to use;1
Helpful;1
Best one out there. However, I would like to see a swipe feature on the widget to archive or delete as oppose to a button to delete to prevent accidental touching. Turning off auto hide is a bit long winded to delete each task. 5stars if this gets added.;1
Great app, looks great and works perfectly for me (tbh, I use it as my grocery list usually!). The only complaint is that there is no option to make an account, which means if you ever switch phones, you'll lose all your lists unless you manually copy it over. I learned that the hard way when my phone was stolen a month ago :(;1
This app is the perfect way to stay organized. Especially with getting married this year, I was getting overwhelmed and losing track of deadlines and items to complete. This app helps me keep track of everything as summarized or as detailed as I want. And being able to have different lists / sublists helps me keep everything organized as well. Simple to use app yet gives me full control over my tasks, priorities, and deadlines. Edit: As a developer I enjoy your responses to negative reviews 😂;1
honestly I don't write reviews often but this is an exception. this is a really good app if your looking for a to do list. it has a widget so you can put them on your home screen. you can put sub lists inside to do list items. when you complete something it says the date and time you completed it. you can color code them too. for me I have a to do list for every day of the week so I can stay productive all week. this app has everything I want and nothing I don't, it's a no brainer.;1
I love lists and this is the app I have been looking for. It helps me stay organised and on top of all the things I need to do. I really like that I can create multiple lists and that there is a widget so I can easily access my tasks and tick them off as I go. So many great features in a really user friendly and visually pleasing app - so many colour options made me extremely happy!;1
This at is very easy to use, and it's a simple design. You can make a bunch of list's, and this app keeps them all organized. Put yours goal list, shopping list, to do list, and any other list you want to make in one organized place. I'm happy with this app. There is a lot of features in this app, and it's well put together. It's worth your time to check it out.;1
Since a recent update, the app I have been using has become more unreliable than my own memory. I downloaded this one to compare and so far it's proving to be much better. This is really clear and easy to navigate and has plenty of options for setting up and customising reminders and most importantly I am getting alerts exactly when required.;1
Great app! Laid out well, lots of ways to change settings based on preferences, and super helpful! I use this for daily, weekly, and monthly tasks, and it has really helped me stay organized and cut down on list-making time. The only thing I wish was different is if weekly/ monthly items would reset after the due date rather than nightly, but I can just check/ uncheck them by hand.;1
This is an AMAZING app and so great for keeping on top of tasks. Busy work-from-home Mum here and I am more organised every day now because of this app. Thanks so much! Would love it if there was a webapp too. It says coming soon with the PRO version. Any idea when this is planned for release? Thanks for your reply. That's great, I'll be getting the pro version immediately in that case :);1
Nice app. Keeps me on task and is fairly easy to use. Edited review to 5 stars, as developer was prompt in solving the issue I had. I still am not convinced that editing line items is intuitive (apparently you tap to edit, and all other apps I've used like this just check the item when you do that), but no real issues at this point. I like the app and it has kept me productive and organized for the week I've been using it, so I'm happy with it.;1
Fantastic app! I travel frequently for business, and it always felt like every time that I would get to my hotel, I would find something that I had forgotten (forgot to pack clothes once, still not sure how I managed that). This app has been a lifesaver! It's so easy to add items, highlight priority items, check them off, and clear the list for my next trip. It's so visually pleasing too, I love being able to color code my lists. I would definitely give more than 5 stars if I could.;1
"When I had an iPhone, I used the built in Reminder app relatively heavily to keep track of things I have to get done soon, remember something new to be done daily, or to break down a major side project into sub-tasks. Ever get a random idea and think ""shoot, I gotta try that"", just to forget it the next day. Put down a line item in this app. You may forget, but this app won't!!!";1
Great todo list\reminder app. Ease of use is it's strength. Great layout. I started to use it moreso, while using apps like any.do less-so. It offers many features for free that others charge for, and it's premium options are far more reasonable than other apps. It's refreshing to see an active developer who readily considers recommendations. (I will forward those as I use the app more and more). Great job, keep up the good work.;1
A while back I was looking for an app just like this, but all of their UIs were messy and they were just horrible to use. This app is perfect - lovely and clean and has all the functionality you'd ever want but all laid out in a way that doesn't cause visual clutter. Great for someone with ADHD!;1
Helps me stay organized and on task! I am an extremely busy person and this app has helped me so much with running multiple businesses at home and other side tasks and groceries that I need to get! You can set a due date and reminders and have tasks with sub tasks and notes. Very thorough! Thank you so much!;1
This app is a lifesaver! I love using it, and after trying a few different task apps. I decided on this one for the minimalism as well as the customizability. You can add quite a bit of depth to your task lists as well with the ability to add descriptions and sub tasks.;1
So far I'm loving this app. I had a very difficult time finding an app that I could set with a different ring tone than my notifications tone, meaning I missed a lot of reminders that I set. This app has changed all that for the better! Love how easy it is to snooze!!;1
"Really great features, even though it took me a while to understand them. I really like the filtered lists and don't get the point of sublists yet. Pls make tasks repeatable without them having a reminder (you can set ""reminder type : none"" but not ""reminder : don't remind me"").";1
Simple, lots of great features, and mostly intuitive, though it is slightly odd using the big tick to save, and it took me a moment to find the option to mark an item as completed (i thought the big tick would do that). Really like the many options for notifications, subtasks etc.;1
I have only had this app one week, but I can't imagine ever living without it again. As another review mentioned, this app is a Godsend for anyone with ADD. The clean, simple layout makes it easy for my brain to process. Gone are the days of post its everywhere (only a few here and there 😁). Makes grocery shopping so easy! I have added it to my tweenaged son's phone, who also has ADD and suggested it to my supervisor, who lives by her to-do lists. You can also share lists! Great Job!;1
Okay, so I have ADHD which makes life damn near impossible sometimes, however the silver lining is this app! This app has saved me in so many ways. I can make infinite lists of whatever is on my mind at any time. I can keep up with exactly what i need to do and when. I can add all the reminders i want and I can customize to my hearts content. The developer is amazing and super helpful. I had a question about the upcoming web app and he replied fast and was very nice! the only thing that would make this app the absolute best of the best is an endless notes section going along with the lists and the web app otherwise this app is so perfect as it is!! I would give 100 stars if i could!!!!;1
"Honestly, it's by far the most useful app you could possibly find that offers so many things without a ridiculous price tag. Having access to all the major for free is incredible and ,unlike other apps, doesn't ram ""Upgrade to premium now"" messages. I personally find it useful for keeping on track with hobbies such as writing books, as on can easily track the things I need to do. I would highly recommend this app because it's easy to use and is not intrusive like other apps.";1
I like this app, its a good layout and easy to use. It would be really good if it had a calendar feature where you could see past tasks that were completed or not. I have recurring tasks and it would be good to see what days I completed them etc. But this is a good app and I have enjoyed organising myself with it. (Following Steve's feedback below, it works how I want. Thank you Steve!);1
App is Awesome But we Need Some Additional Features Like : 1. Quick Undo Button if We delete or Move any Task Mistakenly. 2. Thumbnail View of all Tasks. 3. Quick Commands Popup menu should be their for every Task in a Lists. i.e Copy , Delete , Share , move etc. I hope we'll get these Features soon in next Updates.;1
Awesome app! Helps me stay organized. The sub lists are extremely helpful, but I wish there could be sub lists within other sub lists. Other than that, man, this app rocks! EDIT: This app just keeps getting better!! With the addition of sub tasks, it's honestly the perfect task-keeping app. It's easy to see both complete and incomplete tasks, and they're all presented in an organized manner. You can also change the colour of the list which isn't just helpful, but fun too! 😁;1
"Great News everyone!! Web Version is here!!! Just opened it up on my desk top, it's beautiful, and ""everything is there, almost"" except the ""filtered list"" haha...That's alright, we know you're still working on it, no problem. I have been waiting for this for a while now, and finally it's here! This makes the app all that more versatile, great app, and great developer! Thank you Mr. Nottage";1
"Lots of good features but I feel it does not have a ""default list"" Or the landing page where you can find all the ""tasks"". Though we can create that using the filtered list but that shows the tasks without the list name. Sub tasks are showing with smaller font size and doesn't look good. Edit 1. Hi Steve, I generally don't give feedbacks. I gave it so that it may help you built a better app. Giving it a 5 star for your efforts.";1
This is easily the best to do list app out there. No bugs, no ads, no nonsense. Incredible intuitive UI (EASY TO USE) And offers lots of customization to personalize how you see, interact, and organize your priorities. Been using it for about two years and is a constant go to for my next task. Absolutely nailed it;1
Awesome app ever. To manage tasks I've tried many apps like Google's tasks, Microsoft's to do, any do, tick tick and many more but this app I found best one to meet all kinds of needs. App is wonderful on its own but should have some more important features like time limit, duration, expiry date and time for each task and sub task as well, each task and sub task should have its own reminders settings or follow main task reminders as well. Thanks;1
Been using it for a while. At first, i didnt like it as much, but then I played with the settings and was able to change what I didnt. I use it everyday to plan my day ahead. It's been way better than just having a running list in my notes. It saves your tasks so you can cross them out when you're finished but if its something you do regularly like laundry or something, you can just tap it to move it back to the top. Also allows subtasks. Def helps keep me organized. What I was looking for!;1
No more little pieces of papers with to do lists. Tasks is much more efficient. Love being able to check my lists and add or delete no matter where I am. I almost never forget my phone but that grocery list gets forgotten at home more often then not.;1
"I like it because I can keep track of things I need to do. I like the highlighted color it's a good sky blue and it's easy to make lists. It feels good to complete a list that takes a long time to complete. It's good for making for later and good for getting things done I give it 5 stars thanks developer ☺️";1
Really good. Two things that would have major improvement. 1. Swiping tasks should be configurable. Not just delete. Say 3 options for right swipe, 3 for left. Also, I'm constantly finding myself wanting to move tasks as subtasks. Not possible. Should be. I will go premium the moment I see an update with these features. Promising. -*UPDATE*- I will join your community and go premium as well as donate. You have my support! Btw. The community, where is it? Not possible to join?;1
Very simple and easy to use. The file architecture and overview it gives me suits me perfectly. I run a farm and have many tasks on going (and interrupted) at the same time. Having to-do lists with so many sub folders lets me keep on top of all jobs at once. I would like to be able to move tasks between sublists if that is possible? Also perhaps a home page rather than side bar for top level of lists. Minor niggles, fine as is! A great app!;1
Easy to use but i wish i could reorganize the order of the sub tasks at times. Also it would be great if once a task is completed it moved to the bottom of the list so you dont have to keep scrolling down past it looking for other things on the list. Update: Thank you!!!! Knowing how to do these two things makes it perfect. I was telling everyone how nice it was before but knowing this makes it even better!;1
Really good app. Takes a little fiddling to work out how to get it set up just right. I like having it as a widget on my home screen so I can see tasks. Would be nice to be able to tick off tasks from the home screen widget without needing to open the app entirely but I am being pedantic. Edit: thank you! My phone obviously didn't accept it last time I checked. Changed to 5* :);1
Simple and super useful! I have been using this app for a week and it's great for those pesky everyday personal chores that are overkill to manage through the calendar. It doesn't have unnecessary complicated features and just focuses on useful features that are really easy to use. Highly recommended. Thanks team !;1
It's really good. You can keep your tasks offline (no account needed), set reminders, create lists and sublists, and it's very thorough about the definition of tasks. Plus it's very good looking. An absolute must have;1
My concerns with syncing and backup will be adressed in a future update if you are a subscriber, which I am, and it's very cheap. Requests: A)From a list with two tasks (1) & (2) - long press one of the tasks (2) and make it a sub-task of the one above (1), without having to enter the task (1) and add a sub-task. The same thing in reverse, as well B)Being able to rearrange tasks and sub-task between each other in a list without having to enter a task C)Remove completed - Remove sub-tasks as well;1
I am always making lists, crossing things off and then rewriting a new list. I wanted to find a simple app to do simple lists, but then be able to form multi layer lists. This seems to do it all. A great interface.. I like it..;1
I really like how simple and visually appealing this app is. The lists are quick to put together and have a pop to them because of the varied colors, so they are easy to tell apart. I really like this app and it's helped me be more organized.;1
Simple and easy to use! The widget is fantastic and easy to read for a 50 year old trying to organize. No ads and free! I must say, i loaded at least 8 apps before i found this one and none of them compare. If you want an app that allows you to put tasks that you need to get done in an in your face format this is it!;1
Nice App. I need a way to organise my priorities and task when working on the computer. I like this app beccause the inerface is simple and practical. Creation of levels of task is easy and I love the fact that I can reorgnize my task in a list just by moving them up and down directly. I dont use this app for tasks in a synced calendar with complex reminders ...;1
This App is perfect for keeping track of tasks. I have one list I use for shopping and add to it as I think of things I need then don't forget anything while at the shops. I have another for payments I nerd to make on payday and so don't forget what to pay. One thing I'd like though is to be able to add the amount I payed each time but for what it claims to do it does very well.;1
This is one of the best to do apps. I use everyday and it helps me a lot. I found 3 minor issues though: 1. When you open the app after midnight, some of the weekly/monthly tasks that I've already marked as done appear again 2. When I switch on the phone, a lot of weekly/monthly tasks I marked as done appear again 3. When in the middle of entering a new task, if I click Back, I only get 2 options: discard or save. There should been a third option: Continue editing;1
Best task manager I've found for personal use. Simple, elegant, and fully functional. Quick add task feature makes it so I don't forget what I'm doing before I am able to write a detailed task out. The elegant and responsive interface helps me stay organized in a painless and efficient manner.;1
This app sets out everything I need to do in an easy to use manner, it also allows me to set reminders and highlight certain lists. I absolutely love this app, everything I need is sorted out and easy to find now. I've tried other apps and some were annoying to use, so I'm glad that I found this app.;1
This app is so helpful 😊 It helps me keep the different facets of my to-do list organized: house, yard, personal, work, health, and hobbies. You can create sub lists for each item as well. It alerts me when I should be doing something (I usually end up snoozing...shhhh), and I can make the tasks repeat. Thank you so much for this!;1
I've looked at about every app out there to organize tasks. This is by FAR the best out there. I've not found another with this much flexibility. I actually have not found anything I don't like about the app. Fits my every need. Great job!;1
I had been using a notepad app, but you had to backspace each item as you went along. With this app, I just click the item as it is done and it marks the item as complete. With one tap, I can remove all completed tasks at once! Plus, I have everything in one place! I highly recommend!;1
This app is wonderful! I've only had it for about a week, and it's changed my life! As someone with ADD, it's hard to stay on top of all my tasks and this allows me to add things quickly to different categories, sends helpful (and not annoying!) reminders, and overall is such a help. Thank you Tasks! Highly recommend.;1
This is awesome app to make notes and get it completed by just a tick. I've suggested this app to more of my friends and my manager to add the tasks. Usually I'll use it in home screen view which is more easy. Note for developer : if its possible can u please add the reminder for a routine task like daily meeting reminder. Now, the reminder settings is asking for due date which is fine for single task. The reson I'm asking is if this feature added this app will more benefitiel. Thanks;1
Love the app so far. It has great interface and plenty of options when it comes to organizing different lists. My only minor gripe with it is that the app becomes laggy when switching between large lists. Otherwise, great app.;1
Simple, straightforward, easy, well-organized. Exactly what I want in a to-do list app. One improvement would be syncing with a browser-accessible version, but if you are looking for a mobile-only app, this is a great choice.;1
Better than Google Tasks, Microsoft To Do, etc. Stephen has outperformed the biggest tech companies in the world with this side-project that has everything I need in a to-do app and feels just right. The widget is great. List creation, item sorting, sub-tasks, reminders, repeating due dates, task notes, priorities, and quick-add are all here and a breeze. Lots of ways to customize in Settings. Once the web version is done so I can sync/manage on my desktop, I'll go Premium. Thanks Stephen!;1
"This app is intuitive and simple to use. I don't know about you, but I don't think making a list should be difficult! I've tried the others (all of them) and in every case, the first task I created was ""learn how to use this app."" It shouldn't take a PhD, people! Try this one out for yourself!";1
If you can, please add a feature to sync all the data with Google. 😉. So as soon as I add a task, it immediately gets synced with my Google account and then if I open tasks with my Google account on some other device, it immediately brings all my data. Otherwise, It is the best app to stay organised at all times!;1
Do I get a premium for free, if I report a bug😅. Edited :- I was just messing with you😅. I am an android developer myself and I know how hard it is to maintain something like this. Steps to reproduce the bug. Step 1 : Fresh install the app (No data in the app) Step 2 : Press and drag hamburger icon upward. Toolbar will go upside and you will not be able to drag it back again. But you can use the navigation drawer by dragging from left to right.;1
This is a super app. I was already using a similar app for years which also had the separately manageable widgets of todo lists ... but this is unsurpassed in terms of personal preference options. You can set the visuals to what's easy on your own eyes (colour, background transparency, font size) and there's also LOADS of functional options (how the lists manage tasks) to fit your own logic. Yet still helps you keep things looking simple, if you tend to get overwhelmed by todos, like me. BRAVO;1
I have looked at planner apps, to do apps and many more. This app is exactly how I lay out my calendar and tasks in a hand written journal. Easy to use and offers a great organized format with tasks and sub tasks. One suggestion: in my handwritten version I have a fold out spreadsheet for each task that lists items, supplies, costs, etc that I need to complete the task and I take that with me when I am shopping so I know what to pick up.;1
"LOVE this app! As a person with ADD, I find this app indispensable in keeping my ""out of sight, out of mind"" tasks in mind. It's clean, easy to use and configure, and the alarm sound is lovely. One further question - does this app have an iOs version for my iPad??";1
Excellent app! I should've switched task apps a long time ago. This app has all the features of my old one (gtasks) and more in the free version. I love the colors for the lists. I love the repeating task option - this is critical for me. Thank you! I may donate to an app for the first time for this app!;1
Thanks Stephen for your immediate response on my query. The app was working fine, now I got the hang of it. I would like to revise my rating to 5 stars as this is by far the best tolist, task and reminder app, I have come across;1
The only thing is I thought it would love completed tasks to the end, but I can't seem to find that function anymore. It's fine, but sometimes I use to like to l back on the stuff I accomplished in a day or make sure what day something got done. No big deal.;1
I have stumbled on this app just now and downloaded it immediately and found that its reminder alarm is uniquely user friendly. In tha past I used Any do and Tick Tock, but none has an alarm that works like this app. It even has a snooze button. No doubt that my efficiency will go up by leaps and bounds. I have also just now subscribed for its cloud feature . But found the charges to be too high.. I request the developer to rithink and reduce the charges and also to introduce a one time payment.;1
Great app by a great developer. There are no advertisements at all, and it does what it promises. It's rare to find something of this quality on the appstore nowadays. One feature that would be nice is an option to set reminders to multiple days, but that's just my suggestion.;1
Lovely, very useful and simple to use. Multiple lists of tasks are available from the widget. Just one quibble, couldn't find a way to restore a list I accidentally deleted with a side swipe.;1
I've tried countess programs, but they all fell short and I reverted to time-consuming paper planning...until now. This program is easy, intuitive, and flexible beyond all the others I've tried, and it's beautifully designed. I love it!;1
This is an excellent app. The setup is clean and very user-friendly, it's fast, you're not bombarded with annoying ads, and to top it off, the app is free. I've had this app installed for a while now and it really has helped me keep different projects and tasks organized.;1
You don't have to erase your task to delete it. All you need to do is press the completed button and it finishes your work. it even tells how many tasks you have and how many you have done. It's great you should check it out. But best of all is to remember in your mind, it helps your brain.;1
Really simple, easy to use method that helps me stay on top of things, monitor my progress and not forget to do anything! I used to write hundreds of lists on pieces of paper and lose them, now I just have one list I use all the time.;1
It has been pretty good. My short term memory is declining, so having lists for all the tasks and things to buy has helped me a lot. The only thing I wish it had was a main screen to see the main tasks instead of using the side tab.;1
I've only been using this for about 5 minutes and I already enjoy it more than my previous list (Out of Milk) ! I love it. And thank you for the no ads :) Your icon is just fine. It caught my attention. AND I LOVE THE WIDGET AHHHH!;1
This app has been a God send. It is very well designed and a lot of thought went into its design and specifications. I have used other Todo programs and this is by far the best one I have used. Highly recommend, you will not be disappointed.;1
I rarely give reviews but this app is very well thought out from the colour to the prioritising feature. Thank you! I recently downloaded the app but I will give you my input incase I have a suggestion.;1
I don't think I've ever actually written a review for an app but felt compelled to say how brilliant Tasks is. Colourful, intuitive and organised. As someone who really benefits from structure but often finds productivity apps boring, this has been a game changer for me.;1
This task management app is phenomenal! It does everything that I would hope it can do and does it in a way that is so well organized and intuitive. One of the best apps of any type that I've come across.;1
Great app. Clean and easy to use. The ability use the alarm instead of just a plain notification that can be lost in all the other reminders is super helpful.;1
Wow! Wow! Wow! ........Great App...😊I love It.... I'm so much happy with this app.....Thank you team... 😀so nich features... I have deleted all other tasks app after installing it... Bcoz it covers all features.. Thank you once again.. 🙂keep improving the app.. ❤❤;1
"Please add ""time is over"" reminder. For example after X hour(s) the app rings to say: hey the time of this tasks doing is over. I also want to report that alarm sound doesn't change and just notification sound can change. Thanks for the great app.";1
It's great to get reminders to complete tasks. Also, it's useful to be able to add items to my grocery list when I am out and about. Plus, once an item is added, I can mark it as picked up without deleting it from my list for next time.;1
I've been using this app for a few weeks and it is great. No trouble at all and very user friendly. Just what I need to track my daily checklists. The only thing I miss is being able to share my list with my wife. I hope that will be a feature in the future. Anyway, thank you so much for this app.;1
I live by my to-do lists, and this app has by far been the best I've found to create and organize them. I *really* wish, though, that there was a desktop version of this app as well, so I could manage my lists both on my phone and on my computer.;1
It's intuitive, concise, and well-organized. Works for daily tasks, shopping, etc. I appreciate that it allows a lot of customization, but also has ways to quickly add things for off-the-cuff listing;1
I love this app. It help me to stay organized all the time but I only have 1 problem I thought that when you set an date and time to do something it would alarm but it only sends a notification. Anyway I still love it.;1
The free version also is very cool and serves the purpose of its name. Adds are also not there and not annoying at all. I will keep this app in my mobile forever.;1
The best thing about the app is it crosses the tasks with a straight line, along with the time at which they get completed. This gives a unique satisfaction.;1
I use this practically every day for work. Better than Office Notes which used to occasionally delete my task lists for no apparent reason. This Tasks app doesn't crash or delete my stuff. I'm very appreciative;1
I have been looking for something that is aesthetically pleasing that I can use to keep track of my projects at work, and this is perfect! No more looking at a jumble of words on excel!;1
Super love this. I love that you can set tasks within tasks (hopefully one day tasks within tasks within tasks). You can prioritize them and track your tasks and all sorts of stuff. It is super helpful in helping me plan my wedding!!;1
Wowza, this app is definitely an upgrade!! Great customization and cloud backup. But, I need to see the due date in widget. Edit, dear Steve, if I wanted full screen widgets, I'd just open the app🙄 needs option to show dates on medium size.;1
I love this app! It is very helpful for organizing my day and has dramatically improved my life. I highly recommend this for making lists or just planning. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐;1
Look no further. Finally a good little app that functions easily and has different functions IF you want to use them. BONUS you can change the colots etc. I dont know why, but when i have a to do list its really important for mee to SEE IT, LIKE I NEED TO SEE IT,;1
The Best To Do List App! You can do basic line items or get really detailed with sub tasks, timers, and places to input information. I had downloaded several similar apps and this was the most user friendly. I absolutely love it!;1
Hi Stephen, Thank you so much for developing an app like this. I am only too happy to support developers like yourself, and due to the lengths you've gone to with making sure youve built something based around the consumers true needs I will be recommending others use it as well. Can you tell me if there's any option to invite users to work on a list together, or is it just the share option you have available? If it's the latter, would you have a think about implementing a feature as above?;1
I hate to rate an app....such a sjlep. So not doing it often...but this one deserves it. Well done. I'd enjoy being able to add custom themes (personal photo maybe with text color option)...cos I'm that kind of girl that photo's everything. :-);1
Love this app! It's quick and easy to enter tasks, and when I assign a due date/time the reminders pop up to let me know is urgent or due now.;1
Great program! It keeps me organized. I label my categories after days of the week. Then I organize my days by puting my todos as subcategories. What ever one's I can't accomplish this program has a feature that allows my to move it.;1
"Good at organizing tasks. The ""Highlight"" feature (and more importantly the ability to filter only highlighted entries) is great for managing to-do items.";1
Its awesome how you can categorise different to do list separately side by side. When you click done, it will show the date task is done. I like to use it to see how long a product can last.;1
Very helpful for my hardware lists;1
Can not share from the application to my email please assist;1
Very Smart and easy to use app. try it. It will take some time to learn everything but once you've done that You'll love it... 😄👍🏻;1
THE best to-do list app out there!;1
So so helpful! Exactly the amount of customization I need.;1
I have so many things in the writing in the lists :D;1
Thos list is nice.. Allows to add sublist and helps me track my task;1
The app keeps my annoying life very well organized even when I'm stressed because it can be used as any other kinds of lists such as a revenge list or a list which represents the ones that you've loved or hated as well....... I really owe a lot to this kind of app to get better when updating....... And I hope that we don't need to pay continuously, but buy once, free forever......😂😄;1
The exact type of organization app that I need. I have tried several other organizational apps and this is by far the best one!;1
This app is just what I needed to keep simple to do lists.;1
Great App!!;1
Great app stopping me from procrastinating... Actually getting things done 👍;1
This app is exactly what i want. Very satisfied with this app.A lot of colour options and can create lists and sub-lists. Easy and nice, user friendly. It will be better if i can copy task to a new task.;1
Easy to set up and navigate. Like it;1
can someone please tell me what to do to get alarm for everyday for daily routine and specific days automatically rather than creating the date everytime;1
Perfect for list making. Only thing I would do is let people have more customization options to make their lists more creative, but other than that it is a solid app I use daily.;1
Great, it has all the functionality that I need;1
Helps lessen my anxiety when I can not down my tasks and them see them marked off. Nice sense of accomplishment.;1
Accessible widget, can color code lists. Even displays the day each task was completed.;1
This app is simply amazing...helps u keep track of all Ur tasks...would definitely recommend to friends and family. 🙂👌👌;1
Easy to use & very helpful!;1
Best app for lists! And I'm picky... Great design, simple and straightforward, it has everything I need. Great job!;1
That's a great app;1
Nice App;1
Very organised;1
Its efficient and so simple to us!;1
Perfect for what I do;1
Absolutely what I needed to stay organised and keep on top of all the little things;1
Fantastic app, does everything it needs to. No more bits of paper all round the house with a half finished list of jobs.;1
Great app;1
I was going to do a ux design for something like this, but this is perfect. Lol. Oh well. And yay!;1
Great;1
Brilliant app. I searched a long time for the perfect todo/task list app and this is what came on the top. I highly recommend.;1
Simple, convenient & satisfies my requirements of maintaining tasks;1
Very useful;1
Great so far! Does everything I want it to do.;1
Great app;1
Great app easy to use;1
Brilliant app and absolutely no complaints at all. Helps me organise my tasks and I love the option of colour coding my lists. The interface is really one of the most user friendly. Only one big feedback is to extend the support of this app to Apple devices too. Would definitely recommend to all my iPhone using friends and family!;1
I've only been using this app for a short while but I love it so far. It's easy to create tasks, organize them into categories (lists) and sort them in a lots of different ways on a list. I love the feature of being able to specify subtasks to a task - I can keep track of the steps of an entire project under one line item. The only thing I don't really like so far is that it seems you cannot create a recurring tasks without giving it a due date.;1
This is so, soooo useful! I love too much to use just ordinary words. Keep doing the good stuff! Y'all rock ~;1
So simple and I find it very useful for organising my life tasks. Actually getting stuff done!;1
Very useful;1
It's a great experience. This app really helps me stay organized;1
Good list functionwhich is all I need;1
Simple and upto the task;1
"I had too many projects, ""to do"" items and lists, I sometimes couldn't sleep. I'm not a big ""techy"" but this app is totally amazing and it has changed my life and more free time on my hands ! I'm still getting use to the change 😄 The only thing I would like to see on some of the lists, is a way to prioritize in order of execution...but still life-changing app..Thanks!👌👍👏🙏";1
I always preferred writing my task on a book. But a book and pen is not handy always an you tend to forget. This is perfect to Task it down before you forget;1
I find it very useful for making a quick list;1
Great app no regrets for downloading it 👌 I highly recommend this reminder app.;1
Does a good job, i like the widget;1
What a fantastic app, so simple to use yet so comprehensive in its functions. A great way to monitor and manage all of your day to day tasks, it's just a great app;1
Love this app! I've tried so many others for my task management and goal keeping, and this one is by far the best! Easy to use, simple, great layout and design, customizable, it's great. 11/10 guys!;1
Very useful;1
I genuinely love this app. The widget for this app is my favorite! The widget is on one of my homescreen pages and it makes it so easy to read. I simply create a task and from the widget I can click the bubble to check it off the list. One of my lists is Family Planning and within that I can create tasks such as: taking a pill, setting doctor's appointments, keeping track of flows and much more. I also love that you can assort the lists by priority and colors.;1
Very useful. Works well.;1
I have been using this app for about a week now. It's been keeping my thoughts straight. Grocery store, Books to read, etc. I haven't up graded yet but probably will.;1
Easy of use.;1
Really good;1
Good app;1
This app does exactly everything you hope it does when installed... great effort, keep up the good work.;1
It is best app;1
⁦❣️⁩;1
Excellent;1
Simple and easy to use. Love it;1
This is a brilliant app! Intuitive, clean and effective... best to do app I've used, and I've tried a few over the years. No horrible ads popping up either, which is a luxury these days.;1
Easy to use. As described.;1
The App is just so amazing I haven't had any difficulties so far;1
simple to use, easy UI, i no longer carry lists on paper! thank you Dev for a lovely app! 👍👍😀 I just downloaded it again onto my new phone, your app is just so stable and convenient. I like the prompts on new installation, slick. I will contribute some $$ asap 👍💖;1
This app helps me to micromanage my tasks and organize my life! You can color code your lists too which makes dividing tasks more pragmatic and visually appealing. It's great! I love it and I continue to get so much more done by using it. I highly recommend it! 4.5+ stars!;1
Very helpful. Thank you;1
Nice app..... very useful to track regular activities and reminders prevent us from forgeting important ones.;1
Life changing, am so much more organized now. Thank u thank u!!!;1
Great app for organising the shopping. I like the way it automatically completes a task if all sub tasks get marked complete.;1
Clean, customizable, widgets, intuitive, and NO Ads. Perfect.;1
Awesome app! Getting ready to retire and spend time traveling in our 5th wheel and wanted to set up check lists for RV/Camp set-up and take-down not wanting to miss any steps in the process. App was easy to set up, and also allows for sub-lists and easy organizing, editing and arranging. Well done!;1
Great app;1
Love it! Thanks;1
It really is a good app. It helps in planning;1
Very helpful;1
I have a Wonderful experience with this App my only concern is sometimes the alarm rings at other times it does not;1
Very useful to me as a new mum;1
Perfect for all my brain junk and memos;1
Love this app! Helpful, clean, simple but gets the job done!;1
Super;1
Awesome;1
Using this for the past month and very happy. Easy to put items on and then either check off or swipe;1
Worked like a charm. One of the most useful/used apps on my phone. Thanks. Now for the flip side. I would very much love to support you but I am not into subscription apps. I would be more than glad to pay a 1 time flat fee for the app if that ever happens please let me know.;1
This at is very easy to use, and it's a simple design. You can make a bunch of list's, and this app keeps them all organized. Put yours goal list, shopping list, to do list, and any other list you want to make in one organized place. I'm happy with this app. There is a lot of features in this app, and it's well put together. It's worth your time to check it out.;1
I love this app;1
Learning to use, has been helpful for shopping list and task lists. Developer is personable to connect with and with each day I am learning more on how to use this great app!;1
It's great to have an app that allows me to keep track of my to-do list everywhere I go.;1
Greatness;1
I like how it's user friendly n you can add n change stuff easy!;1
I'm a courier at a law firm and this ap is perfect for organizing deliveries.;1
Simple and easy to use. Recommended!;1
A great app. After trying several task apps I finally found this one which does everything I need in a simple but effective way. This is one of very few apps I use every day.;1
Tasks has helped me with lists to buy certain things one of the things I'm working on right now is a PC, I made a list of what PC parts I need;1
Very easy to use. Nice features.;1
Can't add an Outlook calendar that isn't on MS Exchange, so that means you can't add any regular personal Outlook calendar. That's pretty bad. EDIT: The developer response links to a page discussing MS Exchange-enabled Outlook accounts. My comment was regarding non-Exchange accounts. So the developer didn't even read my review properly.;0
I was using it and thought it was pretty good.I had my whole business schedule on it, then I lost my phone. I got a new phone and downloaded the app again, logged on and no schedule! It was gone! I lost thousands of dollars and had many clients pissed off at me... So disappointed...;0
I want dedicated column for week number in month view widget!!! Added after editors reply: I want week numbers in separate column, NOT IN SUNDAY COLUMN!!! And I do not understand why I have to get votes on forum to get updated feature, even if I paid for it.;0
Garbage. Fails to notify reminders about half the time unless app tab is open. Phone and app settings verified. Missed a long awaited appointment this morning...why even bother setting reminders;0
Used to be great but just constantly wipes out all my repeat appointments now! It's become absolutely useless and support never respond. I pay for proband it's now money down the drain;0
"I do understand ""free"" means accepting advertising, but your recent ads are horrible, cannot be shorten, and sometimes embarrassing. I uninstall now. Left you two stars for old times sake. *Added after Dev response. It wasn't the frequency. It was the advert that was served. I think it was some kind of Japanese pornstar (not sure cuz I was busily trying to close it, to no avail). I was in meeting with Client, checking next date, and the unstoppable advert happened. Simply cannot risk this again";0
Ads that completely take over your phone and have a forced timer so you can't exit out of them.;0
This was one of the best apps for free out there but now they added these invasive ads whenever you make a new event in the calendar and some of them are like 30 seconds long. You can't skip them until it's done. This app is now hot garbage. I don't mind ads, they need to make money but 30 second ads about making a social media account, or jump scare ads, or straight up scams is invasive and abhorrent. You guys need to find a different ad service provider.;0
Too much ads in the free version. Impossible to stop to watch it until the end, i'm not the first to strongly condamn it, you reply you are trying to fix it, but you set it !!! Should be less aggressive, and may be more users customers. I waited few months you react and correct it. ==> personaly i'm unstalling it;0
I've been asking the developers of this app for YEARS to add the ability for the user CHANGE THE TEXT COLOR of the day numbers in month view. The current gray color doesn't offer enough contrast when using dark themes. We also need the ability to add clearly visible grid lines surrounding the day cells in month view. Two very simple requests that go ignored year after year after year.;0
I'm so disappointed. I've used this app for years as it was one of the best calendar apps, but now the obtrusive video ads that hold you hostage have completely changed the experience. I finally had to uninstall it because it's to the point where it's just too much. I'm understanding about banner ads if you don't want to buy the Pro version, but this is unacceptable.;0
"I already paid for the paid version and now they want me to pay again for it or have to put up with ads. Not cool to have to pay again and again and again! As I said ""Not cool to have to pay again and again and again."" So when my phone needs to be replaced you have changed the app's name so I have to pay for it again. Other developers allow the user to install the app on their new phone and keep the same features they are familiar with and love. Doing what you have done creates bad feelings";0
used to be the best calendar available until they decided to put extremely invasive ads. I know it requires a lot of work and I'm perfectly fine with ads. I'm not fine with invasive and deceptive ads trying to trick you instead.;0
Very basic calender. Outdated UI . Not possible to integrate with Google task or other task managers. Few functions for collaborative work . MOST DESIRED FEATURE of a calender is a ability to add events and add invites from other apps and emails and thats missing.;0
Have paid for pro version. Used to be decent but now struggles syncing with Google whereas other calendar/task apps do without problem. Have now moved to Etar as its open source, free and provides the same functionality needed.;0
There were no Ads when I installed it and now every time I put my schedule there is Ads so I need to wait. It's very annoying!!!!! I will find another app.;0
I have paid for the pro version inside this app itself. But checking the business calendar 2 Pro app I still am prompted to pay again. Why is this? Why can't I download the Pro version even though I already paid for it?;0
Does not sync. Not worth it to miss meetings. Force synced does not typically refresh. Back to Google Calendar. Sync is a big part of being a calendar app.;0
It started out great but now there's video ads every time you go into the app to add a date;0
Why is it impossible to see text of event (I PURCHASED pro version and sent You email) I just resent an email ... with screenshot;0
"Recent update crashes the app a few seconds after launch Update: I know what's causing it. I have a root level adblock and with your new full screen ads that get blocked, it instead just relaunches the app for me. I'm not disabling my adblock for one app, full screen ads unacceptable anyway for an app branded for ""business"" use.";0
Was good. But not keeping up with the world. Having font size a pay feature with today's high resolution displays make the text so tiny that it can't be read. So in order to use the free version I have to pay for it.;0
I am going to drop this app after years of use because of recent full page video ads which are out of control. Edited to add: of course the free version has ads. Always has, and I don't mind, because *something* has to pay for app development. But these new full page, video that can't be shut down, in your face for many seconds ads are new and intolerable. That was a bad business mistake you can correct. I hope you correct it soon. I'll be checking back to see.;0
Its a great app I used for years. I was ok with ads, but the full screen can't be immediately banished ads make it unusable. When I need Calendar info, I need it RIGHT NOW. I'll give it a couple of weeks but if it doesn't go back to discrete corner ads I'm out. Edit post response: I'd have paid a couple of bucks for ad free version, because it is better than stock Calendar. But its not 7 bucks better. So if you're not going to remove full screen ads, after years of using, gotta say buh bye...;0
Used this app for years, but I can not tolerate the recent full page video ads that pop up after every calendar entry. I use the free version which I know is sponsored by Ad, the recent updates allow intrusive , excess ads that you can even skip and I can't renter the app to verify my calendar entry was added/modified corrected. The developer or owner has really overstepped with the recent updates and ads. I'm going back to the free Google app instead. I hope you push out a new update before y;0
Excellent UI. Easy to use and sync to gmail. Events and tasks all at once. Since the last update on Feb 13, 2020, this app shows video ad. after modify calendar which you cannot close until the ad is finished. You have to be careful if you are in quiet environment ie meetings.;0
Recently a ridiculous amount of advertising has been added to this app & I'm unable to add appointments while I wait for the ad that covers the whole screen to finish. I can no longer use this as its affecting my business. It has been a good calendar for years but i will be deleting it asap. Update - the developer responded & said that an ad appears only every 18 hrs... THIS IS INCORRECT. An ad appears after every diary entry + other times too. I enter multiple entries every day so get many ads.;0
I have used this app for a couple of years now and it was great. It had small banner ads before, however recently they have incorporated video ads which play every time you input a new plan. This is incredibly tedious and a massive waste of time. DO NOT DOWNLOAD.;0
"support doesn't want to fix issue in event calendar creation, or to make this optional for users to decide . there is a bug/feature which moves the event to next day when i specifically selected today's date if i do it after 23:00 . this logic is flaud , even me as software developer will not decide for my customers such a thing, and will put a msgbox ""do u want to create event tommorow?"" or at least put a check box in options to match user aspectations.";0
Ads with free apps are acceptable, but fullscreen & non-skippable ads blocking the entire screen for 20 seconds are NOT. Awful user experience. Google has recently removed 600 Android apps from Play Store because of disruptive fullscreen ads, this app may be the next one to be removed. Not recommended.;0
Recent addition of VERY intrusive full-screen video ads has crossed a line. At first I thought my phone had been hacked! I totally understand need for revenue for a great free app, but this is too much. I'm going elsewhere very soon without a change!;0
Works fine but the ads are horrible. Every time I enter something new I have to watch a slow ad. I'm removing it!;0
This used to be a very good calendar app with plenty of good features in the free version already. Unfortunately they introduced intrusive full-screen ads recently to force you into buying the premium version. I'll rather switch to another calendar app than be blackmailed like that.;0
UNSKIPPABLE video ads pop up when you are adding or editing an event. I mean video ads popping up in a *calendar* app is bush league already, but unskippable? May as well have a boxing glove on a spring pop out of my phone and smash my groin - that's probably preferable.;0
Ads started appearing whenever I'd modify something. Not cool. Edit: I have no problems with banner ads, but ads that completely disable functionality for a period of time completely defeats the purpose of using this app for better functionality.;0
Developer started to add invasive ads, and worst of all, the functionality that was working before, is not working anymore. Probably the app is busy with the invasive ad and forgot about the job at hand :) And yes, I know about the payed version;0
Best calendar app ever. But im not giving 5 stars until we get the desktop version we have been requesting for the past 5 years.;0
Am getting reminder notification sounds, but with no notifications to dismiss. I have raised this issue many times over the years with no resolution. Happens on LG and Samsung. Various Android versions. Now on Android 10. Have to force stop the app.;0
I am also looking to change after years of usage. The app stooping to advertising unless a NEW upgrade is paid is dishonest. I paid for my old version and was satisfied with its functionality. Not interested in your new version;0
The ads are a joke. Completely destroyed the experience. Maybe they haven't tried searching for calendar on the play store and noticed the hundred other options? Look elsewhere for calendar needs!;0
Had this app since July 2015 and since January it says buy pro which I have done almost 5 years ago. Support is no help I've contacted them for months with no help just told to uninstall (quick fix just uninstall) with no promise all info will return. 😡;0
Used to be 5 stars. I've used this app for years.... The sudden addition of full page unskipable adds ruined it. It looks like I'm not alone in my disappointment.;0
Using the app since years, now whenever open the app, trying to save an entry, full page advertisement opens for atleast 30 seconds causes missing what more to enter on different dates, this app is at its worst;0
I have paid for the pro version. It works for a few months then asked me to pay again. Sent an email to the support email. They replied they have nothing to do with the payment. So who does then. Stay away guys.;0
Great format-- but SUCKS due to ad popups that won't go away-- LOCKS YOU OUT OF APP UNLESS YOU PAY FOR PREMIUM VERSION!!! TOTAL & COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME/DATA UNLESS YOU PAY FOR PREMIUM....!!!;0
Used to be great. Been using for 5 yrs +. Now tasks don't add, other calendars don't show data. The only event data that shows up is event data I add in the calendar.;0
This app's reminder is always late. ALWAYS LATE. I don't know if there is a problem in my setting. But I'm really not enjoying this app. I REALLY DON'T. I thought this app will help me. Big thumbs down. 👎;0
Used it for years. Great app but uninstalled it after they added adds during editing appointments... I use a different app now...;0
Loved it until they added cartoon ads. You'll be with a client and a video game comes up as you're scheduling their appointment. Makes us look very unprofessional.;0
"Does not sync automatically. Very frustrating. Have to go in and ""Sync Now"" even though setting is set to sync every hour. Done with this app";0
I've used this calendar for years. It has always been the best. But now they've added ads. Unless those go away, I'll be finding a new calendar.;0
DO NOT INSTALL THIS APP. I used to love it, but in the most recent update the advertisements have made it absolutely unusable. I am switching to google calendar and never looking back;0
Hello I just upgraded to your go pro within this free version but it looks like nothing changed.. How do I get those pro features? Where are the widgets? Do I have to install the Pro app? I have to buy it again if I did that, I've looked it up already. Please fix this. I have already refund your app.;0
It was all going good, even the irritating adds, until today where the app crashed and all my data saved on it are gone. I'm really irritated now.;0
BC2 won't sync with Google Calendar. Autosync is enabled, but still, events created or deleted from app will not sync with online calendar or Google calendar app.;0
Awful! At one point, I bought the Business Calendar 2 app, and I the update has ads. I'm supposed to purchase the newest version? Yeah, no thanks.;0
Iam horrified to find that a lot of my historical data has disappeared from the app. The info is vital for my medical records. If anyone has an idea on how to retreive it please let me know.;0
The new full-screen video advertisements make the basic version of this app unusable. I'm looking looking for a replacement.;0
The pop-up advertisements make the free version impossible to use. I will be forced to change to a different app after years of use;0
Full screen ads you can't skip every time you add or edit an event !!!;0
NOT into your ads. I've had your app on my phone for YEARS. Uoure about to be deleted for a Google calendar. Sorry.;0
Full screen video ads! I can live with banner ads but not this.;0
I don't use the free version, I like to pay for software that deserves it. I tapped on the app today and had an interstitial ad. Do not do this again for a business app.;0
updated and the only thing new is ADS. deleting after years of use over multiple phones.;0
Used to be great app. Now sucks, unpredictable syncing and other day not syncing Google calendar on Android 10.;0
Never responded to my original review in 2019 and the response to my latest review still doesn't answer the fact that any tasks that are recurring DO NOT show in calendar even though you sync this information.;0
App starts ads after 1 month and opens wanting paid every time after the first month.;0
Deleting. Was great. Now horrible. Bad move with the ads guys.;0
"Ads that cover the whole screen [Later update] Since you bothered to respond to my review I will elaborate: 1. Any app that displays weird looking adds (ads for games?!) that cover the whole screen are suspicious apps: spyware, etc. You should count yourself lucky that I did not report your app to Google. The only reason for not doing that is that I've been using your app for some time, before the new ad behavior, and it was fine. 2. Let's ignore my previous point for a minute and consider this: a ""Business Calendar"" app that sends me adds about online games that I can ""skip"" by stopping the app and then re-opening... Really, if I'm a business person what would I want with an online game for children? 3. You mentioned the apps has to be deployed daily. Tough luck! I did not make your release schedule, you did. Furthermore I would be perfectly fine using an older version of the app, with no ads, or far fewer adds. I really don't care about the latest releases, and most business people don't either. We want stable things that we don't need to upgrade every week or so. 4. Since the ads covering the whole screen started being pushed I realized that your app has little added value over the calendar apps that came preinstalled on my mobile devices... And they don't have any adds.";0
Waste of time, unusable cannot delete events;0
Horrible marketing adds every time, removing the app.;0
"Full screen ads ruin it all I've been using this since it was just ""business calendar"". It was still $7 back then so I wouldn't buy it but would click the ads every now and then. Now with the full screen ads it's practically unusable. Also, before the dev comes in with the stock ""the free version has ads"" response: no duh it has ads. We didn't pay for the app because its upfront cost is too high so we liked the corner ads. Now you force them to take over our screens. Uninstalled and 1-Star.";0
Don't bother installing this app. The free version is garbage. Recently the developer made the decision for inclusion of ads. The ads pop up every time you add an event to the Calendar. The developer has chosen to sacrifice usability of the app and consumer comfort in the rush to monetise the app. I have uninstalled it and will not be returning to the app again.;0
I used to love this calendar, but now it has full screen ads/videos that take over your phone. Can't do anything else while the pop-up ad is running. First one of these I saw - UNINSTALLED!! ... Response: The ads definitely come up more than twice per day and the calendar is definitely NOT functional while the ads are running - you must wait for the commercial to end before you can open the calendar again. I can understand bar ads at the top or bottom of a free app, but full length commercials?!;0
I recently switched over from the original business calendar app which I have been using for many years. This version has a fancier UI but functionally seems much the same as far as the calendar goes which is fine, if it ain't broke don't fix it! I think other features have been added but I don't really use them. Update: full screen ads suck. They appear and cannot be closed for a long time. Show me an ad if you must but let me close it, the free version is unusable this.;0
I used to like, even love this app. It was great. Now though, every time I add an event on my calendar an ad comes up and stays there until it is finished. It's awful! So far the ads have not been inappropriate, just annoying. I don't think that going to the pro version would fix this. I don't even know how to find the pro version to purchase as it doesn't show up in the play store. Super frustrating. I don't want to find another app. I just want this one to work without the silly ads.;0
Resonse (2/13/20): I know that the free version is not ad-free.  The issue that what you have done recently is to force people to watch ads instead of just clicking them away. And this happens while I'm trying to add or edit something on the calendar. Had to change from 5 to 1 star because of these pop up ads. Will be looking for a new app soon.;0
I've used this app for years and have loved it up until now. Now I get full page ads that sit there for 5 seconds and disrupt what I'm doing. I don't mind a full page ad that I can back out of or scrolling ads at the bottom, but to force me to watch a 5 second ad is not reasonable. Seems like they're forcing you to pay up or move on to another app. If this continues I'll find another app.;0
I purchased this app once but for sone reason i now have the free version??? Whats up with that???;0
Love this calendar up until a few days ago. The ads used to be fairly non-intrusive, which I get and could totally live with. Now they have a full screen animation that you have to wait on to use the calendar. Totally unacceptable when I'm with a customer. Absolutely do NOT recommended this calendar as currently configured.;0
I have been a subscriber of the pro version for years when this new version came out I tried it and there were problems. I tried it again and it seems to work well. I tried running with one alarm and now it dosen't stop when I acknowledge it I'm going back to the old version. I have removed pro 2 if the problem pesiststs I will have to find a new calendar. Very frustrated.;0
I uninstalled it within 20 minutes of paying for it. Its features don't work as hoped, especially font and color customization: the unpaid version advertised *presets*, aka themes. But they didn't exist in the Pro. This is on an Android 10, Oxygen 10.3.1 TMUS 1+6T. Developer, your 2020.3.3 reply makes no sense: it still doesn't take into account this *particular* phone or my specific terms. Here's to those themes in future releases, along with a dynamic icon, and the developer's professionalism.;0
I paid for this app, and it was a wonderful app, easy platform, customisable. BUT, there has been a recent addition of ads. All the time! For an app I have paid for I think this is disgusting. I response to you, no these aren't spam events linked to my phone. I uninstalled this app and used my original paid version of the called app and there are no ads. I was prompted to update to this version a while ago. I thought it was just an ad on from the paid version of business calendar I had.;0
Used the free version for years, no issues, didn't need the pro features. Then they started putting in ads - not the kind that pop up along the bottom but ones that completely hijack the screen while you're trying to work. Worst bait-and-switch I've ever seen.;0
"Do not download this app. There are Ads everything you use i (as of Feb 26, 2020), despite what the developer says about the ""18 hour"". Just read other reviews and you'll see that the intrusive Ads have killed this free app. Look for another similar app";0
Reduced to 1 star after second repetitive dev response. (edit after dev response) I get having ads, but full screen ads that you have to wait to skip are very annoying. I am fine with ads that appear at the bottom. Great app until the full screen ads appeared;0
Used to be good. Now massive full screen adds with sound. First time they ran without warning, very embarrassing. Will give it a week to revise, then will uninstall. Adds are ok, but the full screen nature with sound isn't.;0
Ad heavy plus unable to use widget and stock calander app;0
The Ads now pop-up full screen. That is very, very, very, very annoying. What if I'm on an important call making an appointment and then you pop-up this irrelevant ad right in my face. Unprofessional.;0
Wow. Had a 30 second ad that gave me the uninstall this app command. I used to like the 1st but eventually moved to the 2nd but after that atrocious ad, I uninstalled and used google calendar which the widget is not as nice but works great.;0
Those fullscreen ads made me uninstall it after years of using it happily. Bye. Won't come back. My response: Or, you know, I can simply use another calendar app that's free and has no ads.;0
Been using this app for years, This app called itself business calendar but now includes popups which blasts the speaker at full volume. How am I supposed to use this app during BUSINESS MEETINGS?? Like the others who gave their feedbacks, guess it's time we move on to another calendar app like OneCalendar which dosent have ads;0
My calendar doesn't show up;0
My go to for years. Until the last update. Ads used to be unintrusive. Now you have to wait 10 seconds after every calendar update for the ad to run. Uninstalling now.;0
Ads interrupt you while adding items to your calendar. This app used to have a banner for ads at the bottom which was fine. Now the ads are annoying and timed. Reply to developer: No thanks. I rather uninstall your app completely. 👌;0
Ever since the last update, I get invasive, annoying full screen ads every time I try to enter a new task. Seems that the update was designed to ruin the app experience. Horrible level of service. Really considering uninstalling.;0
"So, 2 (almost 3) years ago I purchased the pro version of this app. At the time, that unlocked access to all present and future ""pro"" aspects. Now, however, after a long list of changes, the fact that I have already paid for this app and been using it for years doesn't seem to matter. I'm now constantly being asked to repurchase a product I already own. To add insult to injury, features that used to be standard (drag & drop) are now a pro feature, that I should already own, cost $6.99 and up.";0
The free version has HORRIBLE ADS. Other than that, the app is marginally better than Google's free calendar app that had no ads... It was an easy decision to uninstall and go back to Google calendar.;0
I regret using it. Well, the apps itself is fine, I have used it for over 6 months. It's easy to navigate. It's not ideal but understandable to have the export calendar function as a pro feature. But then, my phone malfunctioned and I was unable to access this apps. There is no online syncing or a web version so that I can refer back to. edit: I have try the syncing method in FAQ. Most of my calendars are local calendars which I fail to sync or switch them to Google calendar.;0
Garbage... Does allow adding exchange calendars;0
I have been waiting for a promised refund since 25th June, have sent several emails. Would appreciate my refund;0
The Agenda widget does crashing on Android 10!!! Very annoying, pls fix it! Thx UPD: I've sent you a lot crasdumps already. It's crashing with all launchers, incl. the stock one. Of course, reinstall, readded, reconfigured... Am senior SW architect/dev, so be sure it's an app BUG. Give me pls your email for troubleshooting, as this drives me really crazy, I need the agenda widget..;0
I purchased this app once but for sone reason i now have the free version??? Whats up with that???;0
Used to be great but just constantly wipes out all my repeat appointments now! It's become absolutely useless and support never respond. I pay for proband it's now money down the drain;0
Can't add an Outlook calendar that isn't on MS Exchange, so that means you can't add any regular personal Outlook calendar. That's pretty bad. EDIT: The developer response links to a page discussing MS Exchange-enabled Outlook accounts. My comment was regarding non-Exchange accounts. So the developer didn't even read my review properly.;0
I want dedicated column for week number in month view widget!!! Added after editors reply: I want week numbers in separate column, NOT IN SUNDAY COLUMN!!! And I do not understand why I have to get votes on forum to get updated feature, even if I paid for it.;0
I was using it and thought it was pretty good.I had my whole business schedule on it, then I lost my phone. I got a new phone and downloaded the app again, logged on and no schedule! It was gone! I lost thousands of dollars and had many clients pissed off at me... So disappointed...;0
Ads that completely take over your phone and have a forced timer so you can't exit out of them.;0
I can't add my Gmail account to your calendar. Used to work flawlessly earlier. Now just won't let me add my account and won't automatically sync data from account;0
Garbage. Fails to notify reminders about half the time unless app tab is open. Phone and app settings verified. Missed a long awaited appointment this morning...why even bother setting reminders;0
With the addition of publicity deep the app lost its productivity side.;0
Since full screen ads were introduced, this calendar app has become very frustrating to use. Despite having found the app to be one of the best calendar apps available, the ads are now too much of a hindrance.;0
"Now down to 1 star for the unappreciated bilingual holiday settings for BC Canada. Absolutely no need for this. The phone and app setting where the language is set to ""English"" should override any other situation. I didn't get a satisfactory answer from the dev. I'll keep deducting stars as long as the app doesn't improve. Update July '20: over 543 different apps and the only 1 ramming French down my phone is BC2! My 1 star won't change until you do. No change!!!";0
Too much ads in the free version. Impossible to stop to watch it until the end, i'm not the first to strongly condamn it, you reply you are trying to fix it, but you set it !!! Should be less aggressive, and may be more users customers. I waited few months you react and correct it. ==> personaly i'm unstalling it;0
Was a good app but recently started flooding you with long ads that you can't get out of until they are finished playing. So annoying. Checking out other calendars now.;0
"Ads that cover the whole screen [Later update] Since you bothered to respond to my review I will elaborate: 1. Any app that displays weird looking adds (ads for games?!) that cover the whole screen are suspicious apps: spyware, etc. You should count yourself lucky that I did not report your app to Google.

Does not sync. Not worth it to miss meetings. Force synced does not typically refresh. Back to Google Calendar. Sync is a big part of being a calendar app.;0
I'm so disappointed. I've used this app for years as it was one of the best calendar apps, but now the obtrusive video ads that hold you hostage have completely changed the experience. I finally had to uninstall it because it's to the point where it's just too much. I'm understanding about banner ads if you don't want to buy the Pro version, but this is unacceptable.;0
It started out great but now there's video ads every time you go into the app to add a date;0
No import/export feature.;0
"I do understand ""free"" means accepting advertising, but your recent ads are horrible, cannot be shorten, and sometimes embarrassing. I uninstall now. Left you two stars for old times sake. *Added after Dev response. It wasn't the frequency. It was the advert that was served. I think it was some kind of Japanese pornstar (not sure cuz I was busily trying to close it, to no avail). I was in meeting with Client, checking next date, and the unstoppable advert happened. Simply cannot risk this again";0
Has all the features I need. However the colors are NOT customizable. I edit a calendar and select a custom color but there's no change applied. FRUSTRATING!!!;0
I've been asking the developers of this app for YEARS to add the ability for the user CHANGE THE TEXT COLOR of the day numbers in month view. The current gray color doesn't offer enough contrast when using dark themes. We also need the ability to add clearly visible grid lines surrounding the day cells in month view. Two very simple requests that go ignored year after year after year.;0
My calendar doesn't show up;0
This was one of the best apps for free out there but now they added these invasive ads whenever you make a new event in the calendar and some of them are like 30 seconds long. You can't skip them until it's done. This app is now hot garbage. I don't mind ads, they need to make money but 30 second ads about making a social media account, or jump scare ads, or straight up scams is invasive and abhorrent. You guys need to find a different ad service provider.;0
1 star (prolly less) after upgrade: U r forcing us either uninstall it or upgrade to pro. I am now regretting upgrading it without reading the comments. DAMN! Old features are already enough for me. Can I degrade it???? 5 stars b4 upgrade: This is the best calendar I ve ever used. The only thing that bother me is that this is not on the ios app store. Will this happen in the coming days because this is the only reason I am still using android.;0
Why is it impossible to see text of event (I PURCHASED pro version and sent You email) I just resent an email ... with screenshot;0
Update: June 2020: do not use this app free version. It recently started forcing full screen ads that lock your screen for the duration of the ad. Original review from 2018: Great app! Very customizable and the ads are small and non-intrusive. I've been using it for years and had only 1 issue that was resolved after contacting customer support.;0
"I already paid for the paid version and now they want me to pay again for it or have to put up with ads. Not cool to have to pay again and again and again! As I said ""Not cool to have to pay again and again and again."" So when my phone needs to be replaced you have changed the app's name so I have to pay for it again. Other developers allow the user to install the app on their new phone and keep the same features they are familiar with and love. Doing what you have done creates bad feelings";0
Used to be amazing and now ads have completely ruined this app. Thanks for the years and cya;0
Very basic calender. Outdated UI . Not possible to integrate with Google task or other task managers. Few functions for collaborative work . MOST DESIRED FEATURE of a calender is a ability to add events and add invites from other apps and emails and thats missing.;0
I have paid for the pro version inside this app itself. But checking the business calendar 2 Pro app I still am prompted to pay again. Why is this? Why can't I download the Pro version even though I already paid for it?;0
Works fine but the ads are horrible. Every time I enter something new I have to watch a slow ad. I'm removing it!;0
used to be the best calendar available until they decided to put extremely invasive ads. I know it requires a lot of work and I'm perfectly fine with ads. I'm not fine with invasive and deceptive ads trying to trick you instead.;0
I've lost an assigment after checking the app for my events for after one year. The app showed that my date was free but it was bussy actually! At some reason the app just did not synced my events for after one year! It cost me my income for the lost event and a lot of frustraion!;0
Plagued with intrusive ads. Once was a great app. Now, it's useless.;0
Have paid for pro version. Used to be decent but now struggles syncing with Google whereas other calendar/task apps do without problem. Have now moved to Etar as its open source, free and provides the same functionality needed.;0
There were no Ads when I installed it and now every time I put my schedule there is Ads so I need to wait. It's very annoying!!!!! I will find another app.;0
Everything is paid;0
"Recent update crashes the app a few seconds after launch Update: I know what's causing it. I have a root level adblock and with your new full screen ads that get blocked, it instead just relaunches the app for me. I'm not disabling my adblock for one app, full screen ads unacceptable anyway for an app branded for ""business"" use.";0
Was good. But not keeping up with the world. Having font size a pay feature with today's high resolution displays make the text so tiny that it can't be read. So in order to use the free version I have to pay for it.;0
"support doesn't want to fix issue in event calendar creation, or to make this optional for users to decide . there is a bug/feature which moves the event to next day when i specifically selected today's date if i do it after 23:00 . this logic is flaud , even me as software developer will not decide for my customers such a thing, and will put a msgbox ""do u want to create event tommorow?"" or at least put a check box in options to match user aspectations.";0
Best calendar app ever. But im not giving 5 stars until we get the desktop version we have been requesting for the past 5 years.;0
I paid for the ability to export calendars, then import them. The problem of all imported entries being backdated 1 day has not been fixed in 2 or 3 years dispite submitting samples showing that the dates are inaccurate in the exported file Buyer beware - totally useless when you change phones you lose all your calendar entries;0
Used it for years. Great app but uninstalled it after they added adds during editing appointments... I use a different app now...;0
Recently a ridiculous amount of advertising has been added to this app & I'm unable to add appointments while I wait for the ad that covers the whole screen to finish. I can no longer use this as its affecting my business. It has been a good calendar for years but i will be deleting it asap. Update - the developer responded & said that an ad appears only every 18 hrs... THIS IS INCORRECT. An ad appears after every diary entry + other times too. I enter multiple entries every day so get many ads.;0
Who's brilliant idea was to add several Holidays (which you can't even delete) that ARE NOT even US Federal Holidays to this Calendar?;0
Ever since the last update, I get invasive, annoying full screen ads every time I try to enter a new task. Seems that the update was designed to ruin the app experience. Horrible level of service. Really considering uninstalling.;0
Used to be great. Been using for 5 yrs +. Now tasks don't add, other calendars don't show data. The only event data that shows up is event data I add in the calendar.;0
This app's reminder is always late. ALWAYS LATE. I don't know if there is a problem in my setting. But I'm really not enjoying this app. I REALLY DON'T. I thought this app will help me. Big thumbs down. 👎;0
Used to be great app. Now sucks, unpredictable syncing and other day not syncing Google calendar on Android 10.;0
Reduced to 1 star after second repetitive dev response. (edit after dev response) I get having ads, but full screen ads that you have to wait to skip are very annoying. I am fine with ads that appear at the bottom. Great app until the full screen ads appeared;0
BC2 won't sync with Google Calendar. Autosync is enabled, but still, events created or deleted from app will not sync with online calendar or Google calendar app.;0
Horrible marketing adds every time, removing the app.;0
Am getting reminder notification sounds, but with no notifications to dismiss. I have raised this issue many times over the years with no resolution. Happens on LG and Samsung. Various Android versions. Now on Android 10. Have to force stop the app.;0
Ads killed an otherwise good app. Had the old paid version too, but that went away. Dealt with less intrusive ads for a while, but now they are out of control.;0
Had this app since July 2015 and since January it says buy pro which I have done almost 5 years ago. Support is no help I've contacted them for months with no help just told to uninstall (quick fix just uninstall) with no promise all info will return. 😡;0
I have paid for the pro version. It works for a few months then asked me to pay again. Sent an email to the support email. They replied they have nothing to do with the payment. So who does then. Stay away guys.;0
I don't use the free version, I like to pay for software that deserves it. I tapped on the app today and had an interstitial ad. Do not do this again for a business app.;0
Hello I just upgraded to your go pro within this free version but it looks like nothing changed.. How do I get those pro features? Where are the widgets? Do I have to install the Pro app? I have to buy it again if I did that, I've looked it up already. Please fix this. I have already refund your app.;0
It was all going good, even the irritating adds, until today where the app crashed and all my data saved on it are gone. I'm really irritated now.;0
Iam horrified to find that a lot of my historical data has disappeared from the app. The info is vital for my medical records. If anyone has an idea on how to retreive it please let me know.;0
Great format-- but SUCKS due to ad popups that won't go away-- LOCKS YOU OUT OF APP UNLESS YOU PAY FOR PREMIUM VERSION!!! TOTAL & COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME/DATA UNLESS YOU PAY FOR PREMIUM....!!!;0
I'm sad I paid for this app. It used to be great. But now it keeps lagging and freezing intermittently, (Huawei P30 pro) I have disabled battery management, tried using original and custom launcher, but app still freezes for 5+ seconds for many actions. Nothing works, and I can't use it in this state... I have no other issues with any other apps. - scrolling in week view - creating event - editing event - deleting event Sometimes freeze, sometimes crash;0
Never responded to my original review in 2019 and the response to my latest review still doesn't answer the fact that any tasks that are recurring DO NOT show in calendar even though you sync this information.;0
I uninstalled it within 20 minutes of paying for it. Its features don't work as hoped, especially font and color customization: the unpaid version advertised *presets*, aka themes. But they didn't exist in the Pro. This is on an Android 10, Oxygen 10.3.1 TMUS 1+6T. Developer, your 2020.3.3 reply makes no sense: it still doesn't take into account this *particular* phone or my specific terms. Here's to those themes in future releases, along with a dynamic icon, and the developer's professionalism.;0
Nope. Nope. Nope.;0
bad. avoid;0
Using the app since years, now whenever open the app, trying to save an entry, full page advertisement opens for atleast 30 seconds causes missing what more to enter on different dates, this app is at its worst;0
This used to be a very good calendar app with plenty of good features in the free version already. Unfortunately they introduced intrusive full-screen ads recently to force you into buying the premium version. I'll rather switch to another calendar app than be blackmailed like that.;0
if you don't stop to force ads clip watching, bye bye.;0
I have been a subscriber of the pro version for years when this new version came out I tried it and there were problems. I tried it again and it seems to work well. I tried running with one alarm and now it dosen't stop when I acknowledge it I'm going back to the old version. I have removed pro 2 if the problem pesiststs I will have to find a new calendar. Very frustrated.;0
"Used to love it, now it's been an issue after issue with this app. You'd expect that it would perform at least the basic task of reading my calendars. Doesn't even do that anymore, no matter how many times I try to sync it. So much for getting the ""premium"" version. Disappointing.";0
App starts ads after 1 month and opens wanting paid every time after the first month.;0
It always reactivate calendar from all google account on the device and show it eventhough I have untick it in the calendar & task list. Calendar is full with unneeded event and the essentials wont show.;0
Best free calendar is now unacceptable with full audio, full screen video ads. The price to avoid the ad mugging is ridiculously too much. Uninstalled and looking for another.;0
Ads with free apps are acceptable, but fullscreen & non-skippable ads blocking the entire screen for 20 seconds are NOT. Awful user experience. Google has recently removed 600 Android apps from Play Store because of disruptive fullscreen ads, this app may be the next one to be removed. Not recommended.;0
Awful! At one point, I bought the Business Calendar 2 app, and I the update has ads. I'm supposed to purchase the newest version? Yeah, no thanks.;0
"Full screen ads ruin it all I've been using this since it was just ""business calendar"". It was still $7 back then so I wouldn't buy it but would click the ads every now and then. Now with the full screen ads it's practically unusable. Also, before the dev comes in with the stock ""the free version has ads"" response: no duh it has ads. We didn't pay for the app because its upfront cost is too high so we liked the corner ads. Now you force them to take over our screens. Uninstalled and 1-Star.";0
Use this app every day and used to totally love it. But in the last month or so they have allowed full-page video ads to take over the screen. The only way to get rid of them is to force close the app, which I now do repeatedly. Can't continue like this! Totally unacceptable. What the heck could they possibly have been thinking. Downright stupid business decision. Looking hard for another app to replace this one as soon as I can. It was nice while it lasted.;0
I've used this calendar for years. It has always been the best. But now they've added ads. Unless those go away, I'll be finding a new calendar.;0
Waste of time, unusable cannot delete events;0
I used to love this calendar, but now it has full screen ads/videos that take over your phone. Can't do anything else while the pop-up ad is running. First one of these I saw - UNINSTALLED!! ... Response: The ads definitely come up more than twice per day and the calendar is definitely NOT functional while the ads are running - you must wait for the commercial to end before you can open the calendar again. I can understand bar ads at the top or bottom of a free app, but full length commercials?!;0
Been using this app for many years. The recent update has brought ads. Uninstalling.;0
Those fullscreen ads made me uninstall it after years of using it happily. Bye. Won't come back. My response: Or, you know, I can simply use another calendar app that's free and has no ads.;0
Force feeds users with video ads after each entry.;0
Been using this app for years, This app called itself business calendar but now includes popups which blasts the speaker at full volume. How am I supposed to use this app during BUSINESS MEETINGS?? Like the others who gave their feedbacks, guess it's time we move on to another calendar app like OneCalendar which dosent have ads;0
Looks polished app but time after time new issues come up. Raising these issues with the developer rarely gets timely response or interest in fixing it (I'm a paid user). Today, tasks lost their subtasks on one device, while the 2nd device is OK (for now) || to devs: Task (and their subs) used to sync across devices via Google Drive.. Seems like you eliminated this feature by switching to Google Tasks in your recent update. Totally useless app now for me (at least);0
I use the Pro version. But What happened to the option to purchase holidays? My Christian and Jewish holidays don't show up anymore.;0
Developer started to add invasive ads, and worst of all, the functionality that was working before, is not working anymore. Probably the app is busy with the invasive ad and forgot about the job at hand :) And yes, I know about the payed version;0
Used to be 5 stars. I've used this app for years.... The sudden addition of full page unskipable adds ruined it. It looks like I'm not alone in my disappointment.;0
NOT into your ads. I've had your app on my phone for YEARS. Uoure about to be deleted for a Google calendar. Sorry.;0
"Do not download this app. There are Ads everything you use i (as of Feb 26, 2020), despite what the developer says about the ""18 hour"". Just read other reviews and you'll see that the intrusive Ads have killed this free app. Look for another similar app";0
The ads are a joke. Completely destroyed the experience. Maybe they haven't tried searching for calendar on the play store and noticed the hundred other options? Look elsewhere for calendar needs!;0
Ad heavy plus unable to use widget and stock calander app;0
Used this app for years, but I can not tolerate the recent full page video ads that pop up after every calendar entry. I use the free version which I know is sponsored by Ad, the recent updates allow intrusive , excess ads that you can even skip and I can't renter the app to verify my calendar entry was added/modified corrected. The developer or owner has really overstepped with the recent updates and ads. I'm going back to the free Google app instead. I hope you push out a new update before y;0
Don't bother installing this app. The free version is garbage. Recently the developer made the decision for inclusion of ads. The ads pop up every time you add an event to the Calendar. The developer has chosen to sacrifice usability of the app and consumer comfort in the rush to monetise the app. I have uninstalled it and will not be returning to the app again.;0
I am also looking to change after years of usage. The app stooping to advertising unless a NEW upgrade is paid is dishonest. I paid for my old version and was satisfied with its functionality. Not interested in your new version;0
I've used paid version for years and it's been great except for the occasional glitch, usually solved by reinstalling the app. But now an event is suddenly just not showing up. I've checked everything, tried sync, install/uninstall, change color of event, toggle bottom menu tabs, checked which calendar it's on, checked if event shows on google calendar app, etc. But no, the issue is with business cal. I would have completely missed this important event if I hadn't checked my calendar on my laptop. Please fix this, a calendar that skips events is useless.;0
This is app is something that I use only because I cannot find something better to fit my scheduling needs. The amount of bugs in the app and the amount of ads I have to sit through is beyond annoying. Not sure why they keep pushing for me to purchase something that consistently screws up because of the bugs. The biggest bug being adding in birthdays or anything that has a date, as instead of putting the date I requested it will put it a day behind or a day beforehand.;0
I really liked the app but now I'm going to have to find something else. They have started to have pop up ads that are very disruptive. I was in a meeting and I had to put in an event in the calendar when an ad popped up and started blaring music and I couldn't close it until the ad was finished. It was very inappropriate. It is now totally unsuitable for a business calendar with these ads. I was fine before when the ads were unobtrusive.;0
1) create 80 000 events to several exchange calendars ... Story continues: I installed several other calendars. Few of them didn't cause any problem. Google Calendar. Very smooth, no any ANR. Agenda+ no ANR. So - for everything is responsible Nine. Yes sure. The same way is Nine responsible for neverending resizing font of week widget isn't it? Still one thing - making event colour without additional identification to which calendar event belongs it is confusing.;0
UPDATE #3 06/05/2020 ADS-ADS-ADS FULL SCREEN, AUTO-PLAY ADS w/ noise 1st Review: Many INTRUSIVE POP-UNDER links open browser subjecting us to crazy ads 12-12-18 Reply to DEV's The POP-UNDER ADS happen upon selection response to your APP message related to the action taken within your APP. I am NOT ACTIVELY SELECTING an AD. I am NOT PASSIVELY SELECTING an AD. I am NOT ACCIDENTALLY SELECTING an AD. This is either a BUG or INTENTIONALLY DEVELOPED annoyance.;0
In response to ur reply... the reminders literally disappear. As though a person has gone into my calender 15 mins later and deleted the reminder set to 0 mins before event.;0
Frustrated - Popup ads have become a nuisance. Far too many. I can no longer recommend this app.;0
It's working, but the ads are getting really annoying.;0
Great app that now has intrusive full screen ads, ugh;0
Loved it at 1st and then it started going weird. Even though I purchased a lifetime I purchased it a second time hoping it would clear up the issues and it only made it worse. Tried to reach out to customer service and they weren't very helpful at all. Then you post and say that I only contacted customer service once? It was actually over 4 times I contacted you via email and most the time the e-mails I got back were so difficult to Understand and varied in suggestions that Didn't work.;0
This calendar was great until the ads. They are out of control, you can not go back, the x button does not work, and they are way more often than ever 18hrs as stated by the maker. If you can get past the crazy ads then its great but, I am over it and can't handle it anymore.;0
What good is a calendar app if it deletes whatever it chooses to? I have used this app for years. But this last year, I have lost dates that were important for me to remember. Birthdays, anniversaries, weddings, trips, family historical events i wanted to remember pick something. This app has chosen to just drop it from my calendar as if I never even put it in. I would have given it 1 star. But it has kept some things. Looking for new, more dependable calendar app.;0
UPDATE: I know it's a one time fee as stated, that I had already paid. Same acct now I don't have pro. I've had it for a while now and had purchased the pro version right away. My reason for giving 2 star now is all of a sudden it tells me I do t have the pro feature anymore that is supposed to be a 1 time payment. 😠 Also, if there was a desktop version that would be majorly useful! Disappointed that I would have to pay for pro again if I wanted to continue those features.;0
Was and is a great app. Used it for years, But now the fullscreen ads are an immediate turnoff. Small ads down the bottom were fine, but forcing me to sit through a full screen ad till the timer runs out is a HUGE NO for me. Uninstalling cos there are plenty of other free calendar apps around that don't force you to wait through adverts.;0
The app itself is great, but they've started adding unskippable ads. It locked my phone and forced me to go through an ad disguised as a video game where I had to shoot criminals just to make an appointment. I had no problem with static ads to support the developers, but locking my phone until I played a dumb game ruined the app for me.;0
What I love is that I can make multiple calendars with the same account. What are some Major problems? 1. My events are not inviting or showing up on the calendars of the people who I include in the event. Sending a text message link doesn't work either. 2. I have had events disappear from my calendar without explanation. Never had this issue with any other calendar and being a person with a Very busy schedule and multiple schedules to adhere to... This is detrimental. P.S. I paid for premium;0
Used this app for years but the recent addition of full screen ads is too annoying. Small banner ads or something similar would be much more appropriate for a calendar app. Why would I want to look at an ad for half a minute when it should only take 5 seconds to add an appointment?;0
Overall a great app to replace both Google calendar app and Microsoft Outlook app. Only thing stopping me from purchasing a Pro licence that has super useful and amazing features is the fact that there is no windows desktop app. ☹️;0
I strongly recomment that you will not use this app if you use outlook calendars! Fantastic App but only for those using Gmail. With outlook you will meet various problems.I realized this after purchasing full ap. Also Tasks posiible only by Google Tasks and attachments only Google Drive and Dropbox (One Drive not available)!!! Update: After installing Blue Mail app, syncing is working smoothly... Please give solution for outlook users and add outlook tasks. If bluemail could it then yo also do;0
"2 many ads. I used this for 4 yrs and 2 cell phones no problem. I used to brag about this app lol. Miss me with the excuses about why things changed(""it helps maintain the app""). You weren't making enough and sold out I respect it but I guess I gotta do the same. ✌️ Peace out and good luck. To all those looking for a better app ""Simple Calender"" over @ simplemobile tools. I hear great things.";0
"meh I left the ""meh"" on 2/2019. Today is 3/2020. While the calendar is ok, the ""themes"" never change and, really, are not anything of interest. They really need to be completely changed. Also, color coding helps me keep track of a lot of things I have going on...the measley 7 or 8 colors they have are TOO FEW & what?! No pink?? (A nice hot pink so it will stand out). I mean, idk, I'm still just meh... 😕";0
Have been using this app for years and have loved it. However, a recent update that includes full screen ads alsolutely kills it. I do appreciate that the developer has kept the app clean and free for the last few years. But with full screen ads, NO, sorry.;0
Been using for years. Just about to delete due to the full screen lengthy ads that not only appear when I add an event, they pop up when I'm using other apps. Did a scan using an ad detector app and Business Calender is the culprit. Shame as pervious ad style was OK, this is ridiculous though.;0
It was good until they introduced long adverts every time you add an entry.... How to annoy your users ! I won't be forced to pay... I have given good feedback in the past and good feedback encourages others to pay now you have decided to make the free version really annoying to use you are creating bad feedback! Good luck;0
The free version was great until now, but since they added advertisements to it (e. g. forced to watch an ad after creating an appointment) I cannot recommend it anymore, it is absolutely annoying, the Google calendar is the better alternative now.;0
Since recent update adverts make the free version absolutely unusable! I understand some adds have to be in the free version, but full screen adds are very disruptive in a calendar app when one needs to work quick :/ ..otherwise the functionality it great;0
It's just a basic normal calendar. Nothing special about it. But now for some reason it no longer shows holidays. Not even the kost common known ones world wide. Such as Christmas or even new years;0
I have had this for years and even have the pro version. Today the application is staying I do not have pro, when I go to on app purchase it even detects purchased but will not give access to pro features.;0
"A few months ago it started to fail to sync with my employer Exchange server. I used to make it work manually, but now it doesn't work even if I ""sync now"".";0
Really useful...untill you added ads. Now they interrupt what you're doing within the app and they are really frustrating. Were introduced a few months ago I think...such a shame;0
Advertisement is annoying frequent, and increasing. I uninstalled after couple of years usage.;0
Really disappointed with the full screen adverts now taking over this otherwise great app. Will be uninstalling and choosing another alternative app (there are plenty) big mistake by the developer!;0
What happened? Ever since the last 2 updates all my recurring monthly appointment show up for 2 months and then disappear. So now I can't rely on this app to remind me of bills.;0
New version and now I have to wait 30 seconds and watch an ad! Just wanted to take a look at my schedule today. This is unacceptable! 30 seconds!;0
Suddenly, again (it has happened before), the widget is empty. I keep refreshing, but the entries vanish.;0
Used to be good, but recently it shows full screen ads which cannot be turned off;0
After an update started showing really annoying full-screen ads. Been using it for quite some time. Will uninstall;0
I love this calendar but a few monthly ago they started adding pop up advertisements when I add an item to the calendar. Very disappointing;0
Recent update causes the widget to crash every time I go to my homescreen (on a pretty common Samsung tablet).;0
I liked this app and used all the time. But popping up ads are now annoying me so much... I'm considering an alt calendar app;0
Calendar works fine, but the adds that can't be skipped are making me furious.;0
No longer the calendar i use since the intro of annoying ads and video ads... Uninstalled;0
"Multiclick spam to ""encourage"" upgrading to pro version.";0
The ads are to loud and in your face.;0
Please remove the annoying and intrusive ads!!;0
Migrating to a new phone was completely messed-up. All my tasks were changed to all day tasks and all appointments hours were lost! Unacceptable errors!!! Calendar can not be deleted - error 'check your internet connection' despite of the fact there was a connection. I use PRO version - meaning I bought it.;0
Loved this app for years. The new full screen ads with no skip option is ridiculous and will likely drive me away. I understand the need for ads but this is too far and I have no need for any of the pro features so I will not pay for it when I can use a different app for free that doesn't block my productivity. I used to recommend this app to anyone who asked but now I won't.;0
I have to agree that the full-screen time-draining ads are not viable for a Business Calendar, regardless of the reasoning behind it. By all means, keep the small rolling ads along the bottom of the screen or alternatively charge a more reasonable fee to go pro. £6 is not an option when there are so many other options out there, such as aCal (which I used to use before BC and am now reverting to)... I'll keep an eye on Business Calendar though because, if you change the ad situation or make the pro price more reasonable, I'll certainly be back!;0
It started strong then the ads were a bit much but it's free and I was thinking about buying it. Then… Events that are clearly on my Google calendar stopped showing. Suddenly. Yes they’re still on Google and show on that app. I don't like that app but I might be stuck with it. I'm sorry this didn't last but I am glad the problem developed before I bought it.;0
I've loved using this calendar for years. My favorite feature is the bar view in the month calendar. I haven't found any other calendar app that does it this well. But recently they ruined the free version by showing full-screen pop-up ads that play for up to 15 seconds before you can get back to your work. I may have paid for the full version before they did this, but not now. If they're going to force uses to pay up $7 to remove such intrusive ads, I'll just move on to another app.;0
I'm changing my rating from 5 to 2. I've used this app for many years and I love it. It's a great app! But they have recently added add on videos (skippable but still 5 seconds long.. ) after you've created or closed an event in your calendar app. It's really annoying and disgusting because you don't have time watching adds when you want to add a couple of events everyday in you schedule... You've went to far Business Calendar 2...;0
I have used this awesome app for 3 years at least. Sleek, convenient, powerful. But the recent updates just bring more and very intrusive ads. If that is not reverted soon, I will have to change app. Pissed by how awesome app become awful because someone wants to make money out of other's great job. And thanks for your copy pasted answer 🙏;0
I used to love this app but they made the ads much more intrusive, taking over the full screen with countdown timers any time you do anything. I guess I'll go back the regular Google calendar app. Reply to developer: that'd be great if you remove the terrible ads. For now I'm uninstalling and checking out other calendar apps.;0
Would've been 5 stars but the new full size ads make efficiency impossible. Those kind of ads are fine when you're playing other games, but stopping what I'm doing in a completely un related app is unacceptable. I understand the banner ads to keep it running, but the full page delayed ads pushed it too far.;0
"Lately the ads have doubled in frequency, have become full screen, noisy and more difficult to close, while the overall usability have decreased. Quite shame. And before telling the ""it's free"" slogan, think that annoyed people will delete, not buy.";0
I used to really love this app as it provides a Todo list widget that can show a lot of Todo list items compacted into a very small space. However it has started showing full screen ads when adding new items so I'm going to be looking for a replacement.;0
I used to love this app. It worked flawlessly for me and it was my go-to calendar app. However, recently I am having trouble where it does not sync anything other than my single Outlook calendar, with my other calendars being visible from my phone, but not having the events also populate on my laptop. This is a huge problem for me and definitely a deal breaker. If this can't be resolved I'll have to start looking elsewhere for a calendar. It still is a nice calendar app, but if you want seemless integration between your phone and your laptop, look elsewhere.;0
There are full-size ads that block your entire screen. Incredibly disruptive and I don't want to reward that by buying pro. There are other calendar apps out there that don't deliberately disrupt your productivity.;0
Its the best callendar ive used. But letely its been freezing a lot, and its annoying because i use it a lot. Pls fix the freezing. Edit. 6months have passed and this is still freezing. Why? I use my calendar a lot, so i cant keep using this.;0
After the last update I had to clear the cache & data, clear the cache partition, then lose all my events to stop the double notifications/reminders. This has been a great app for many years and this is the first time I've had trouble with it. It was a pain to go through all that to fix it but that's how much I like this app. I have a Galaxy S9+ with latest IO update. UPDATE: No matter how I set my reminders, the maximum # I could get it to alert was two. I gave up & went back to BC Pro. Ugh!;0
I thought BC2 was going to be very good for my multiple personal projects. It looked well developed, and at first its help looked good.  But I had to abandon it because its help turned out to be useless -- it never mentioned any issue I needed answered as a learner of the program.  Thus I just could not learn the program.  The help may be better for other people.;0
"Checked out this app in my quest to find a good solution for combining calendar events and tasks into a single, scrollable homescreen widget. --- Unfortunately, although the app has the option to repeat a task ""from the completion date,"" the functionality is broken.  For example, I scheduled my test task on a Tuesday and set it to repeat every week from the completion date. The app forced there to be a day of the week listed in the repeat schedule, so that it would say something like ""repeat weekly on Thursday on completion date."" --- Now, having a day of the week and also ""from completion date"" makes no sense, so I was curious what the app would do. I set my Tuesday task to repeat every Thursday from completion date and checked it off on a Sunday. The app should have rescheduled the task for the following Sunday, but it didn't. It scheduled it for the following Tuesday and completely ignored the ""Thursday"" and the ""from completion date."" --- Sorry, Business Calendar 2, but that's just not going to work.";0
"Main issues to solve: 1) in the icon app there isn't the indication of current day. Would be very useful to have it instead of the standard BC violet icon 2) there isn't the possibility to set two different time zone in the fields ""from"" and ""to"" in the same event. It would be very useful to set fights event with different time zone. 3)the location link should be synchronised with Google maps results, not with the contacts, in order to have the right response for the addresses. Please update";0
"I used to love this but now I need to pay an insane amount or have both the Pro and free versions both on my phone. ""If you already have purchased the old Business Calendar Pro, you just have to keep it installed on your device to activate all the pro features of Business Calendar 2. Unfortunately we have no possibility to automatically check, if you are a pro user of BC 1. We can only check, if the old BC Pro app currently is installed on your device. """;0
it was good until the recent updates. i installed this app because of its widget. however, the recent update destroyed everything that i have customised. there are a lot of setting to make the widget looks good but the update limited the setttings. i event went all out in purchasing the app thinking it could be like it used to be, maybe i can change it back with unlimited setting, but it's not as good as before. im disappointed;0
It was good but I guess Google is sabotaging it, so I lost a couple of notifications. Removed it and started using Google calendar and notifications are now ok. Sorry.  I have uninstalled the program since I missed an important appointment I can no longer trust it.  Probably the solution you provide works, but I think it you should force the user to check those settings on start so one doesn't miss appointments.;0
"This app just ""disappeared"" two of the recent events I listed in, both weddings. Luckily I thought of rechecking a day after inputting them. This has happened a couple of times already. Too unreliable for work appointments, I might get fired when I rely on this app's widget for work appointments. Close to uninstalling, after I check out a good replacement";0
This app worked well for a year. Had ads, but I was fine with that. The latest update made the ads much bigger, appearing in the task sidebar instead of banners at the top and bottom. I was annoyed but tolerated it. Then today I got a full screen video add that I couldn't close until it was through. That's too much. Deleted. Reply to reply: I know I can pay to get them removed but I don't want to support a company that pushes an update with full screen video ads you can't close.;0
"Very nice app with a bad drawback: today's repetition for a recurring task will not appear unless I mark yesterday's task as done! Here's how this is very bad for me:  - I have many recurring daily tasks, and it's a very tedious job to mark all my recurring tasks as done, even those that were NOT done! It gets much worse if I don't use the app for a few days! Then I have to mark all recurring tasks as done for every and each previous day!!!!  - The app forces me to record false information! A task that was not done on a specific day, should stay there as NOT done, and the recurring task should be generated for the following day.  - You have only 3 options for a recurring task: 1) to mark it as done in order for it to appear on the following day. 2) not to mark it as done, and it will never ""recur""! 3) to delete, and it disappears, and naturally, it will never ""recur""!  A recurring task should recur, regardless of marking or not marking the previous repetition as done!";0
The interface is incredible! It's the perfect organizational app I've always been looking for. This is all overshadowed for me however by the fact that it is automatically attached to your email with no way to remove it. I would use this app daily if it would just exist in it's own bubble without needing to grab onto 3+ emails. Minor complaint but it really turned me off from the app, and if I had known this I would not have used it in the first place.;0
Would have been nice to explore more features without having to go pro right out of the gate. I'm not down to pay for something that supposedly works without trying it for myself. Could have easily enabled more options that entices the user other than the bare bones vs. I'll stick with Google for the time being;0
Actually it is a good calendar app, but on Android 10 Google calendars cannot be synched without the Google Calendar app installed on your device. You have to sync your calendar by another calendar app, or all your BC2 events will stay on your local device only. So this means, that another calendar app is required to use this calendar app, which makes this app useless at the moment. I am waiting for a fix.;0
This is by far the best out there but it is not reliable because if i get a new phone for whatever reason the data will not transfer to new phone (data will be lost or i will not have time to set the settings and input previous data in new phone )and that is only reason i cant trust this app. I am very upset that one flaw kills a very good app. Anyone that uses a calender heavily knows the trouble of my example. Again, by far it is a very very good calendar app.;0
App works good. But with the latest update, 25 seconds of ad.. for adding an appointment. Not recommended after the update.;0
I loved this app until the latest update. Full screen ads that you can't cancel are just too annoying. I'm outa here..;0
Use to love this app as I've had it for well over a year. Just recently it magically deleted all my appointments with no way of getting them back. Tried everything from resetting to reinstalling no resolution. I paid for the app so was a little disappointed that I have to look for another app and reenter all my appointments (20+ a day);0
Doesn't sync properly anymore. Have been using the free version of this calendar app with my Google calendar for years without problems. But for the last half year or so, the appointments don't sync, the invites don't get sent. It has become unusable and unreliable. I have had to switch to the Google calendar app now.;0
Loved it untill recently when it started playing adds eveytime i put in an appointment. Now ill have to get a new calender app after years of using it and loving it. Too bad.;0
Loved this app, but recently noticed I really was't hearing the audio from notifications and for some unknown reason, although the notification volume for the pro version sounds loud at 100% system volume for notifications, this version (BC2) sounds half as loud, if that, to the point it's unusable because I rarely hear them. UPDATE: Just realized that for some odd reason BC2 calendar notification volume is mapped/linked to Ringtone volume and I had that lower than half volume. Please fix this.;0
Buggy as hell. Keeps duplicating events when I edit them leaving me with the old version and the new side by side. I keep deleting the old one and it keeps coming back. I'm irritated and I'm going to look elsewhere now. I loved the original business calendar but after giving it more then a fair chance this version is a no go.;0
Using Google Pixel 2 and paid for full version...sometimes the day on the calendar doesn't update. I dont want to have to restart my phone everday. A workaround would be to press the refresh button on the calendar, but i dont like having to do that every day.;0
Great app, but it just syncs to my google calendar making it redundant. I wanted to use this for nonpersonal task and keep it separated. While using the App I get 40 notifications because it updates my personal calendar as well. I gave 2 stars because otherwise the functionality and UI is really nice.;0
"Does not sync. If i enter an item in the agenda. It does not sync with the widget. Sometimes it takes a whole day before it is visable in the widget. In the widget only 2 items are visable. The rest keep saying ""loading"" for days now. Even if i manually sync.";0
Overall it's a great app that I use every day but what I truly hate is I paid for the full version and since I have 3 Google accounts in my phone no matter what instructions I'm given by the developer it doesn't recognize I bought it because it defaults to the wrong account. If they fix and let me select correct amount I'll bump my rating back up. Should have an option. Sad;0
Don't like it much Event, Task, Favorites at the bottom confusion. Entering data is tedious too selected hide for completed task it may have deleted them. Need simple customization features and I HATE the computer time task settings which it uses. pros easy to read overview. Thx. mbf;0
The app is not working well since the latest update (2.37.0): the app crashes a lot when creating or editing tasks, the reminder for tasks and meeting are not working (notifications are enabled), so that makes the app useless. Reinstalling the app doesn't solve anything.;0
WHY DO notes dissapear? I pun something today and tomorrow it doesn't show up at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! To Answer:1)Yes 2)local 3) i go in the App-Month View-click on day box-write details+hour/all day.save.Then it shows up in the app and widget for a few hours and then it's gone .4) i have a stable internet connection . What should i do?;0
hi, i am not able to use the paid version to full. Kindly help me. the help and feedback is not loading itself.;0
Would be great but almost everything you need to customize it when you first install it is pro only. You can't customize font settings - it's pro. You can't import old calendars - it's pro. How am I supposed to start using your app then?;0
aCalendar > Business Calendar > Tiny Calendar > Tick Tick Pro aCalendar's design, featurr and logic is from 2004 Business Calendar is better but still stupid and feels like from 2010 Tiny Calendar really improves from the 2 above. Nice modern design and good drag/drop feature but still suffers the same wrong logic and bad design as Business Calendar. Tick Tick is the modern calendar that wins because its designed with modern logic designed with proper modern features. Less touchpoints and jus;0
better than Google calendar but has bugs/for example it keeps restoring deleted events after i delete them/i cleared cache memo and restarted phone/useless/still the same banana. update/yes i did remove Gmail account but no use/it seems a bug between localhost and oppo accounts as it shows both colors for the same birthday/btw i tested removing oppo account or localhost then i get a bug free part of the calendar but it bugs again after that part. update/yes 2 entries but for a certain period.;0
first time opening good experience. Everything from google calendar was synced, then stacked up my events for the day. Opened the app a few hours later and absolutely everything was blank. And you have to pay $7 to be able to drag and drop your events.;0
First I liked the free version but after a while it got annoying with all the advertisements;0
There's no option to remove time rows in the widget, only an option to remove the time bar which is kinda pointless. Was hoping for a simple layout for the widget to display only days (7 days) without all those crowded rows of time displayed. Would otherwise give it a 5 star.;0
This an amazing calender, my only problem was I was looking for a calendar for solely for my business , because this app you must sync your calendar it becomes useless because now you have your personal calendar mix with business. Useless for that purpose I can just use my Google calendar.;0
Every entry gets copied so I end up with 2 of everything, one in the color I designate and the other in the standard color. If I delete 1 I loose both. I used this calendar for years for my business and loved it but the latest update killed it.;0
Office 365 integration doesn't work, so it's basically useless as a business calendar. As a private calendar I don't see any big improvement over Google calendar,but it's not worse either.;0
Great App with one major flaw. When entering addresses and selecting from the drop down options, the house # disappears and leaves only the street, city, and state without the actual house or business number. This is a huge problem for me.;0
Good - the only thing it has that isn't on my Samsung cal is Agenda view. Crappy- My SCal has dark mode. BusCal - you can basically F off if you're vision impaired. Font size & dark mode are paid only. Not fun to test drive in the bright white light. UNINSTALL...;0
In response to ur reply... the reminders literally disappear. As though a person has gone into my calender 15 mins later and deleted the reminder set to 0 mins before event.;0
Too many ads! I used to like this calendar. See my original rating below. ..... This calendar does everything I need it to do and I enjoyed this app on my Galaxy S7 phone. Now I have an S10. Only some content will sync. Is there an S10 version I don't know about? Thanks for your help.;0
I loved this calender but it's really disappointing how often I add something and the next day it's disappeared.;0
Took more than 3 years, but they've finally managed to get BC2 to a similar perhaps even better level than the original. 3/10/2019.. update. Unfortunately, usability is severely compromised. Busy calendars are almost unreadable unless in day view. Tap to create appointment can drop you in very strange time slots (10:05 or 14:40). Clock to set times is backward step from BC1 which is BY FAR the best way to set times on a calendar. I like the auto link to contacts in bc2. 2 line favorites bar pls.;0
Migrating to a new phone was completely messed-up. All my tasks were changed to all day tasks and all appointments hours were lost! Unacceptable errors!!! Calendar can not be deleted - error 'check your internet connection' despite of the fact there was a connection. I use PRO version - meaning I bought it.;0
The new adds system is getting really annoying. Ads were a footnote in previous versions... now they interrupt what I'm doing ... really frustrating;0
Good app which I have been using for years, but recently full screen ads started appearing that can't be removed and the app has to be killed from task switcher before can get back to calendar!;0
Ads are becoming really invasive and you have to wait at least 5s each time before you can skip, see another ad, then come back to the calendar. Not inclined to buy pro with such bad user experience... Edit : And most people use a calendar app once or twice a day, so I guess dev are aiming for maximum ad visibility... I know nothing is free but this is annoying, and it's video ads for silly games. I guess I'll uninstall soon..;0
4k 7g8 0 3rd v of. Uhuh;0
Advertisement is annoying frequent, and increasing. I uninstalled after couple of years usage.;0
I've used paid version for years and it's been great except for the occasional glitch, usually solved by reinstalling the app. But now an event is suddenly just not showing up. I've checked everything, tried sync, install/uninstall, change color of event, toggle bottom menu tabs, checked which calendar it's on, checked if event shows on google calendar app, etc. But no, the issue is with business cal. I would have completely missed this important event if I hadn't checked my calendar on my laptop. Please fix this, a calendar that skips events is useless.;0
This is app is something that I use only because I cannot find something better to fit my scheduling needs. The amount of bugs in the app and the amount of ads I have to sit through is beyond annoying. Not sure why they keep pushing for me to purchase something that consistently screws up because of the bugs. The biggest bug being adding in birthdays or anything that has a date, as instead of putting the date I requested it will put it a day behind or a day beforehand.;0
Great app that now has intrusive full screen ads, ugh;0
It's working, but the ads are getting really annoying.;0
Frustrated - Popup ads have become a nuisance. Far too many. I can no longer recommend this app.;0
UPDATE #3 06/05/2020 ADS-ADS-ADS FULL SCREEN, AUTO-PLAY ADS w/ noise 1st Review: Many INTRUSIVE POP-UNDER links open browser subjecting us to crazy ads 12-12-18 Reply to DEV's The POP-UNDER ADS happen upon selection response to your APP message related to the action taken within your APP. I am NOT ACTIVELY SELECTING an AD. I am NOT PASSIVELY SELECTING an AD. I am NOT ACCIDENTALLY SELECTING an AD. This is either a BUG or INTENTIONALLY DEVELOPED annoyance.;0
I really liked the app but now I'm going to have to find something else. They have started to have pop up ads that are very disruptive. I was in a meeting and I had to put in an event in the calendar when an ad popped up and started blaring music and I couldn't close it until the ad was finished. It was very inappropriate. It is now totally unsuitable for a business calendar with these ads. I was fine before when the ads were unobtrusive.;0
It's just a basic normal calendar. Nothing special about it. But now for some reason it no longer shows holidays. Not even the kost common known ones world wide. Such as Christmas or even new years;0
1) create 80 000 events to several exchange calendars ... Story continues: I installed several other calendars. Few of them didn't cause any problem. Google Calendar. Very smooth, no any ANR. Agenda+ no ANR. So - for everything is responsible Nine. Yes sure. The same way is Nine responsible for neverending resizing font of week widget isn't it? Still one thing - making event colour without additional identification to which calendar event belongs it is confusing.;0
This calendar was great until the ads. They are out of control, you can not go back, the x button does not work, and they are way more often than ever 18hrs as stated by the maker. If you can get past the crazy ads then its great but, I am over it and can't handle it anymore.;0
Overall a great app to replace both Google calendar app and Microsoft Outlook app. Only thing stopping me from purchasing a Pro licence that has super useful and amazing features is the fact that there is no windows desktop app. ☹️;0
Loved it at 1st and then it started going weird. Even though I purchased a lifetime I purchased it a second time hoping it would clear up the issues and it only made it worse. Tried to reach out to customer service and they weren't very helpful at all. Then you post and say that I only contacted customer service once? It was actually over 4 times I contacted you via email and most the time the e-mails I got back were so difficult to Understand and varied in suggestions that Didn't work.;0
What good is a calendar app if it deletes whatever it chooses to? I have used this app for years. But this last year, I have lost dates that were important for me to remember. Birthdays, anniversaries, weddings, trips, family historical events i wanted to remember pick something. This app has chosen to just drop it from my calendar as if I never even put it in. I would have given it 1 star. But it has kept some things. Looking for new, more dependable calendar app.;0
I liked this app and used all the time. But popping up ads are now annoying me so much... I'm considering an alt calendar app;0
The app itself is great, but they've started adding unskippable ads. It locked my phone and forced me to go through an ad disguised as a video game where I had to shoot criminals just to make an appointment. I had no problem with static ads to support the developers, but locking my phone until I played a dumb game ruined the app for me.;0
Suddenly, again (it has happened before), the widget is empty. I keep refreshing, but the entries vanish.;0
The ads are to loud and in your face.;0
Really useful...untill you added ads. Now they interrupt what you're doing within the app and they are really frustrating. Were introduced a few months ago I think...such a shame;0
New version and now I have to wait 30 seconds and watch an ad! Just wanted to take a look at my schedule today. This is unacceptable! 30 seconds!;0
Calendar works fine, but the adds that can't be skipped are making me furious.;0
I strongly recomment that you will not use this app if you use outlook calendars! Fantastic App but only for those using Gmail. With outlook you will meet various problems.I realized this after purchasing full ap. Also Tasks posiible only by Google Tasks and attachments only Google Drive and Dropbox (One Drive not available)!!! Update: After installing Blue Mail app, syncing is working smoothly... Please give solution for outlook users and add outlook tasks. If bluemail could it then yo also do;0
I love this calendar but a few monthly ago they started adding pop up advertisements when I add an item to the calendar. Very disappointing;0
What happened? Ever since the last 2 updates all my recurring monthly appointment show up for 2 months and then disappear. So now I can't rely on this app to remind me of bills.;0
"2 many ads. I used this for 4 yrs and 2 cell phones no problem. I used to brag about this app lol. Miss me with the excuses about why things changed(""it helps maintain the app""). You weren't making enough and sold out I respect it but I guess I gotta do the same. ✌️ Peace out and good luck. To all those looking for a better app ""Simple Calender"" over @ simplemobile tools. I hear great things.";0
hi, i am not able to use the paid version to full. Kindly help me. the help and feedback is not loading itself.;0
I'm changing my rating from 5 to 2. I've used this app for many years and I love it. It's a great app! But they have recently added add on videos (skippable but still 5 seconds long.. ) after you've created or closed an event in your calendar app. It's really annoying and disgusting because you don't have time watching adds when you want to add a couple of events everyday in you schedule... You've went to far Business Calendar 2...;0
It was good until they introduced long adverts every time you add an entry.... How to annoy your users ! I won't be forced to pay... I have given good feedback in the past and good feedback encourages others to pay now you have decided to make the free version really annoying to use you are creating bad feedback! Good luck;0
Pls give us dark theme cost-free so my eyes won't die using this app;0
I have had this for years and even have the pro version. Today the application is staying I do not have pro, when I go to on app purchase it even detects purchased but will not give access to pro features.;0
"A few months ago it started to fail to sync with my employer Exchange server. I used to make it work manually, but now it doesn't work even if I ""sync now"".";0
"meh I left the ""meh"" on 2/2019. Today is 3/2020. While the calendar is ok, the ""themes"" never change and, really, are not anything of interest. They really need to be completely changed. Also, color coding helps me keep track of a lot of things I have going on...the measley 7 or 8 colors they have are TOO FEW & what?! No pink?? (A nice hot pink so it will stand out). I mean, idk, I'm still just meh... 😕";0
It started strong then the ads were a bit much but it's free and I was thinking about buying it. Then… Events that are clearly on my Google calendar stopped showing. Suddenly. Yes they’re still on Google and show on that app. I don't like that app but I might be stuck with it. I'm sorry this didn't last but I am glad the problem developed before I bought it.;0
The app doesn't sync after making changes on my Google calendar, even after hitting the sync now on the app;0
UPDATE: I know it's a one time fee as stated, that I had already paid. Same acct now I don't have pro. I've had it for a while now and had purchased the pro version right away. My reason for giving 2 star now is all of a sudden it tells me I do t have the pro feature anymore that is supposed to be a 1 time payment. 😠 Also, if there was a desktop version that would be majorly useful! Disappointed that I would have to pay for pro again if I wanted to continue those features.;0
I have used this awesome app for 3 years at least. Sleek, convenient, powerful. But the recent updates just bring more and very intrusive ads. If that is not reverted soon, I will have to change app. Pissed by how awesome app become awful because someone wants to make money out of other's great job. And thanks for your copy pasted answer 🙏;0
Been using for years. Just about to delete due to the full screen lengthy ads that not only appear when I add an event, they pop up when I'm using other apps. Did a scan using an ad detector app and Business Calender is the culprit. Shame as pervious ad style was OK, this is ridiculous though.;0
Have been using this app for years and have loved it. However, a recent update that includes full screen ads alsolutely kills it. I do appreciate that the developer has kept the app clean and free for the last few years. But with full screen ads, NO, sorry.;0
Was and is a great app. Used it for years, But now the fullscreen ads are an immediate turnoff. Small ads down the bottom were fine, but forcing me to sit through a full screen ad till the timer runs out is a HUGE NO for me. Uninstalling cos there are plenty of other free calendar apps around that don't force you to wait through adverts.;0
55 o;0
First I liked the free version but after a while it got annoying with all the advertisements;0
Its the best callendar ive used. But letely its been freezing a lot, and its annoying because i use it a lot. Pls fix the freezing. Edit. 6months have passed and this is still freezing. Why? I use my calendar a lot, so i cant keep using this.;0
Nice widget, and I don't mind a few ads, but persistent ads are annoying. When I get annoyed, I tend to rather go somewhere else, than becoming a paying customer.;0
Used this app for years but the recent addition of full screen ads is too annoying. Small banner ads or something similar would be much more appropriate for a calendar app. Why would I want to look at an ad for half a minute when it should only take 5 seconds to add an appointment?;0
"Multiclick spam to ""encourage"" upgrading to pro version.";0
How do i go pro does this app only work with facebook I dont have face book.;0
Please remove the annoying and intrusive ads!!;0
The free version was great until now, but since they added advertisements to it (e. g. forced to watch an ad after creating an appointment) I cannot recommend it anymore, it is absolutely annoying, the Google calendar is the better alternative now.;0
What I love is that I can make multiple calendars with the same account. What are some Major problems? 1. My events are not inviting or showing up on the calendars of the people who I include in the event. Sending a text message link doesn't work either. 2. I have had events disappear from my calendar without explanation. Never had this issue with any other calendar and being a person with a Very busy schedule and multiple schedules to adhere to... This is detrimental. P.S. I paid for premium;0
Really disappointed with the full screen adverts now taking over this otherwise great app. Will be uninstalling and choosing another alternative app (there are plenty) big mistake by the developer!;0
After an update started showing really annoying full-screen ads. Been using it for quite some time. Will uninstall;0
Used to be good, but recently it shows full screen ads which cannot be turned off;0
Best free calendar app I've used, syncs with Google and outlook calendars...... ....Edited from 5 to 2 stars...the video ads are too painful. I've already read the default reply to the other reviews complaining about this. I know the fee is low and one time...I promised myself I'd get the paid versions of all the free software I use once I'm not on student income. But I'm not rewarding this painful ad practice by going paid. I will pay for a different calendar.;0
Since recent update adverts make the free version absolutely unusable! I understand some adds have to be in the free version, but full screen adds are very disruptive in a calendar app when one needs to work quick :/ ..otherwise the functionality it great;0
No longer the calendar i use since the intro of annoying ads and video ads... Uninstalled;0
Recent update causes the widget to crash every time I go to my homescreen (on a pretty common Samsung tablet).;0
I used to love this app but they made the ads much more intrusive, taking over the full screen with countdown timers any time you do anything. I guess I'll go back the regular Google calendar app. Reply to developer: that'd be great if you remove the terrible ads. For now I'm uninstalling and checking out other calendar apps.;0
You can't set a location by name, only address. Yes I tried setting my location manually, like that would be at all useful. Do you even understand what I'm saying? I CANT TYPE IN LA FITNESS AND GET AN ADDRESS. It will just send me to whichever is closest. Setting my location wouldn't help, it would just send me to the closest one to my manual instead of one that may be further... Worthless.;0
Wonderful app with nice visual hierarchy, but now ads take over the entire screen;0
I have to agree that the full-screen time-draining ads are not viable for a Business Calendar, regardless of the reasoning behind it. By all means, keep the small rolling ads along the bottom of the screen or alternatively charge a more reasonable fee to go pro. £6 is not an option when there are so many other options out there, such as aCal (which I used to use before BC and am now reverting to)... I'll keep an eye on Business Calendar though because, if you change the ad situation or make the pro price more reasonable, I'll certainly be back!;0
Would've been 5 stars but the new full size ads make efficiency impossible. Those kind of ads are fine when you're playing other games, but stopping what I'm doing in a completely un related app is unacceptable. I understand the banner ads to keep it running, but the full page delayed ads pushed it too far.;0
"Lately the ads have doubled in frequency, have become full screen, noisy and more difficult to close, while the overall usability have decreased. Quite shame. And before telling the ""it's free"" slogan, think that annoyed people will delete, not buy.";0
It works! Does what it's supposed to do, although I don't require any features other than setting an appointment/event, and being reminded of it. Unobtrusive, even when using it as a free version only. I'll probably upgrade to PRO just to reward the developer. Edit: The new 30 second ads really screw this up.;0
I've loved using this calendar for years. My favorite feature is the bar view in the month calendar. I haven't found any other calendar app that does it this well. But recently they ruined the free version by showing full-screen pop-up ads that play for up to 15 seconds before you can get back to your work. I may have paid for the full version before they did this, but not now. If they're going to force uses to pay up $7 to remove such intrusive ads, I'll just move on to another app.;0
Loved it untill recently when it started playing adds eveytime i put in an appointment. Now ill have to get a new calender app after years of using it and loving it. Too bad.;0
Loved this app for years. The new full screen ads with no skip option is ridiculous and will likely drive me away. I understand the need for ads but this is too far and I have no need for any of the pro features so I will not pay for it when I can use a different app for free that doesn't block my productivity. I used to recommend this app to anyone who asked but now I won't.;0
I hated the pop up ads.;0
App works good. But with the latest update, 25 seconds of ad.. for adding an appointment. Not recommended after the update.;0
I used to really love this app as it provides a Todo list widget that can show a lot of Todo list items compacted into a very small space. However it has started showing full screen ads when adding new items so I'm going to be looking for a replacement.;0
There are full-size ads that block your entire screen. Incredibly disruptive and I don't want to reward that by buying pro. There are other calendar apps out there that don't deliberately disrupt your productivity.;0
I loved this app until the latest update. Full screen ads that you can't cancel are just too annoying. I'm outa here..;0
The font size is realy small and you can't change it without paying for the full version. Large font is a basic accessibility feature, it shouldn't cost extra.;0
This app worked well for a year. Had ads, but I was fine with that. The latest update made the ads much bigger, appearing in the task sidebar instead of banners at the top and bottom. I was annoyed but tolerated it. Then today I got a full screen video add that I couldn't close until it was through. That's too much. Deleted. Reply to reply: I know I can pay to get them removed but I don't want to support a company that pushes an update with full screen video ads you can't close.;0
The interface is incredible! It's the perfect organizational app I've always been looking for. This is all overshadowed for me however by the fact that it is automatically attached to your email with no way to remove it. I would use this app daily if it would just exist in it's own bubble without needing to grab onto 3+ emails. Minor complaint but it really turned me off from the app, and if I had known this I would not have used it in the first place.;0
Since 2018 the app does not register some of the calander input. Apparrently due to poor internet connection. Now sitting next to the wifi router and entering all my appointments for January, needless to say none were regesterred!!!;0
I bought the previous version and can't use this one full version if not bought too which I think is not ok Well, why would I have to kip old application? I understand but I don't like the idea to have duplicated apps. But I raised the reading to 2 starts cause of that!;0
I love how personalisable this app is and the widget is fantastic. The weather app doesn't always work and my tablet and phone won't sync tasks even when I ask it to manually. 👎;0
Overall it's a great app that I use every day but what I truly hate is I paid for the full version and since I have 3 Google accounts in my phone no matter what instructions I'm given by the developer it doesn't recognize I bought it because it defaults to the wrong account. If they fix and let me select correct amount I'll bump my rating back up. Should have an option. Sad;0
The app is not working well since the latest update (2.37.0): the app crashes a lot when creating or editing tasks, the reminder for tasks and meeting are not working (notifications are enabled), so that makes the app useless. Reinstalling the app doesn't solve anything.;0
Doesn't show a content of reminder on Locked screen even if its correctly set in the Settings. Fix it and I'll change my rate. BTW, Google Calendar knows how to wake up a locked screen and show notifications;0
Gtasks Sync doens´t work. Calendar Sync is ok;0
This is by far the best out there but it is not reliable because if i get a new phone for whatever reason the data will not transfer to new phone (data will be lost or i will not have time to set the settings and input previous data in new phone )and that is only reason i cant trust this app. I am very upset that one flaw kills a very good app. Anyone that uses a calender heavily knows the trouble of my example. Again, by far it is a very very good calendar app.;0
This an amazing calender, my only problem was I was looking for a calendar for solely for my business , because this app you must sync your calendar it becomes useless because now you have your personal calendar mix with business. Useless for that purpose I can just use my Google calendar.;0
Doubles and triples all my appointments in my calendar making it hard to manage.;0
Buggy as hell. Keeps duplicating events when I edit them leaving me with the old version and the new side by side. I keep deleting the old one and it keeps coming back. I'm irritated and I'm going to look elsewhere now. I loved the original business calendar but after giving it more then a fair chance this version is a no go.;0
Actually it is a good calendar app, but on Android 10 Google calendars cannot be synched without the Google Calendar app installed on your device. You have to sync your calendar by another calendar app, or all your BC2 events will stay on your local device only. So this means, that another calendar app is required to use this calendar app, which makes this app useless at the moment. I am waiting for a fix.;0
WHY DO notes dissapear? I pun something today and tomorrow it doesn't show up at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! To Answer:1)Yes 2)local 3) i go in the App-Month View-click on day box-write details+hour/all day.save.Then it shows up in the app and widget for a few hours and then it's gone .4) i have a stable internet connection . What should i do?;0
Doesn't show a files attached to the event using Google Calendar.;0
For the Samsung Note 9 newest OS update. Customer service FINALLY figured out the problem. And it worked for about a month. Then Samsung sent out a new OS & the reminders are firing even more randomly than before. Just emailed tech support AGAIN. I have to say, I do love the app & tech support is good, but response time is slow. But unless developers can find away to keep it working no matter what update the phone developers come up with, I may have to find a more Google friendly app.;0
"Does not sync. If i enter an item in the agenda. It does not sync with the widget. Sometimes it takes a whole day before it is visable in the widget. In the widget only 2 items are visable. The rest keep saying ""loading"" for days now. Even if i manually sync.";0
Just paid for this app. Latest update, I've lost some events in 1 of the 4 Google calendars I view. Those events show up just fine in the Google Calendar, and used to show up o.k. My free Business Calendar. I see you did an update July 20. Maybe there is a bug in that version. I tried stopping the app, cleared cache, cleared all data, started over. Still missing some events in one calendar. Refresh/resync doesn't help. All events showing in Google Calendar. Shut down, restarted phone, not fixed.;1
I like that it keeps more than a years worth of data. For the most part, it is easy to use. The main complaint is having to struggle past ads fairly often. The good thing is that they don't last long. Ads are always irritating. It never used to lock the screen with ads.;1
Runs smoothly with all my mailing programs at a time: outlook, Gmail, roundcube. Maybe a little design update needed, but the best mailing app I have used so far. An integration of Google maps for addresses of meetings (in the premium version at least) would be nice!;1
I really like this calendar. It syncs well with my Google accounts - better than other 3rd party calendar apps I've tried. (I've only used the free version);1
Having problems. The app is not syncing anymore with my Google calendar. I double-checked the settings gs and permissions and tried to force a sync, still no good. It is set to auto sync every 3 hours. Edit: changed from 3 to 4 stars. I appreciate the suggestion to try and help. It didn't fix the issue. However with my new phone the app is working seamlessly. Very easy to use, lots of customization, visually easy to read. Thanks.;1
I've had this app for many years as it used to be the best. It's had some difficulties the past couple but they are improving again.;1
Very good app. Helps me keep organized, and does not let me forget anything. Also, syncs with the google account so I don't miss any dates. I would only suggest that they change all the tasks paid options to the free app, so we could have the opportunity to compartimentalize the complex tasks in projects and also to repeat the tasks daily or weekly, to achieve milestones and to track them. This app would become exceptional and dependable. Thank you, I know you will ponder my suggestion 🙏🏻😊;1
This is the best calenders and task combination, I've found so far. I very much like the feature that allows multiple reminders. Syncing with Google calendar is still in development. Even though both allow tasks, subtasks and reminders, the syncing is not yet perfected. It would be great to see this done.;1
Great app. Pulls together lots of info that keeps me in-the-know and sane.;1
I like how it works. Though one massive thing I can't either figure out how to do (which is more likely the case). Or you just don't have a repeat of the same event without having scheduled it 6 separate times in one day. Like eat 6 times a day. Supplements 8 times. I think you get it. Other then that it's perfect for work. Quick and easy for me to keep my clients in there own lane and me on time.;1
I've been using it for a couple of years & it's worked well for me. I like being able to set reminders on tasks, something GTasks doesn't do by itself. I did spring for the paid version since i use it pretty heavily and to get the all-in-one widget. Worth it!;1
Lowered to 4 stars because still can not use CalDAV to sync tasks, so they are only on the phone. Don't break the phone. Or you can use Google tasks if that's enough for you. Otherwise it's very good. I'm moving away from Google and this does do calendars via CalDAV. Use DAVx5 to sync.;1
The only problem I have is I really really miss the pop-up reminders, hopefully that will be brought back. But still by far the best calendar app I've tried. I used the original business calendar since it was first released many years ago.;1
Great App I can't live without. Just wish they would apply the HTML Code in Tasks so that I can write in bold, italic, etc and I can drag appointments around in Agenda View of the calendar. Good work guys. Keep it up!;1
"Better reminder system is needed. Setting do not seem to ""stick""";1
Love it. I'm self employed with several appointments a day. Being able to see my appointments at a quick glance is really helpful and a must for me.;1
I would have given 5 stars if it was possible to sort tasks manually. I have been waiting for this feature for so long! Other than that, you really have tons of useful features 🙂;1
Early I was able to register birth date in 'Birth Day' reminder and it reminded on the day with the age. As 'Mr Satish age 55.' That feature is missing.;1
"Displaying the ""Contacts"" calendar of every Google account cannot be deactivated in Calendar & Tasks list (it re-activates immediately).";1
Top of my wish list is ability to copy and paste events. Other than that, great app.;1
The month pop-up in weekly view doesn't work... Not sure why... Otherwise I'd give it 5*.;1
Very useful. Easy to plan daily schedule. Please keep on improving.;1
Great helping app, would be 5 if events won't disappear occasionally, possibly because calendar is shared between two gmails;1
Wish it wou.d sync better to audio all calenders that I have in google;1
One of the few android apps I've been happy to pay for, and never regretted doing so!;1
Extremely smooth start and sync. Including reverse sync from app to calendar;1
Still using this app every day. Some of the best with frequent updates. Kudos to the developers!;1
Exactly what l need and what l have been looking for... very easy to use. -Zimbabwe;1
Sometimes doesn't synch over devices.;1
There is a lot of good in this app, but I want to mention places that need improvement. There needs to be a setting for how often the app syncs with your calendars. Also, if you change a meeting time in outlook it doesn't seem to update in Business Calendar.;1
I've been using the paid version for several years now. The calendar is well designed and I enjoyed everything it can offer. Recently though, there are sync issues with my google calendar. I sometimes have to do it manually.;1
Sometimes widgets don't update themselves and stay the same day.;1
Love the program and it's definitely an improvement over Google Calendar. Just the easy moving back and forth between dates using the 'go to' feature is a huge plus in my book. It does have some short comings that are irritating to me at least. I use my calendar to keep track of my to do lists. I save them in the Description field. First off the editing features such as bolding, underlining, line numbering, etc don't appear anywhere unless like in my case you accidently discover them by doing a;1
Much better calendar then the one that came with the phone.;1
I like this app quite a bit. It has more useful features compared to the normal Samsung calendar app. It does not, however, play well with Google. In that I can't ask Google what my agenda is and have it pull info from this app. Lame. Hence 4 stars only. Not sure if that's a Google thing or a thing for this app. Otherwise I like it a lot.;1
What happened to the setting for choosing how far in the future to sync calendars? The app on my phone is only showing events for 1 month in the future, and then the calendar is blank. There are many events much further out than this, that I can no longer see on the app. I've been through the entire menu tree and no longer see the setting for length of time to sync.;1
One or two minor hiccups when inserting advance appointments which resulted in a difficulty with getting the diary back to 'todays' date. I had to turn the phone on and off in order to correct this. Also had problems with the app widget failing to download after the phone has been turned on. Other than those issues the diary has been great. I would love to have more options to customise the appearance of the app, eg background or page colour options only work when you insert an appointment.;1
This is a superb organisational app! It met.my.needs when I was hunting around to replace another to do app that failed with an upgrade. I would recommend this to anyone. However there are still some imperfections. The subtask lists in the paid version does not synch with Google's tasks in calendar. So I see deducted a star.;1
its a good calendar! . Definitely bettwr then most and if they keep up Ill continue to use it. They also are constantly improving the app I'm having difficulties getting it to open on the correct day I'm sure it's just a setting I can't figure out the app keeps opening on a day for days from the current day;1
I like this app, because it fits well in my daily routines and offers very many settings, especially regarding appearance. It has some basic design flaws and misses some easy opportunities, but all in all it is a valuable application for my personal time management.;1
"Their widgets had gotten better since my last review. I really appreciate the calendar with the tasks on the side! If there was a morning ""your day today"" or ""plan your day today"" alert in the morning, that would make it even better! I went to Any.do for that, but their calendar and sync to my waze app was off so I came back lol";1
Very good... Just one point. When listing coming up tasks it would be good to have bands of background semi transparent color to highlight today's events and next 3 days events for example to be distinguished from far future events. All in one list with no distinction tends to be overlooked;1
Did what I wanted it to, and i paid for the pro version because it was pretty easy to use and i think developers deserve the support :) Only gave 4/5 stars because it's not very aesthetically pleasing. It's plain and i wish they had more options for themes, colours ans fonts.;1
Integrates nicely with all calendars;1
One or two interface aspects I might wish to adjust. Would like event status to be reflected in it's display. Would like events to reflect their event-type category.;1
Just like it's predecessor it's an excellent calendar manager! I initially couldn't find specific settings like setting default event reminders, but Appgenix was quick to reply to my original review. Settings>Standards for new Events/Tasks>Reminder. Also, it would be great if the Tasks feature could show Lists from Google Keep.;1
The app is good. I am using the pro version since years. It works well with Google calendar. Now I want to use my Outlook calendar as well. But I can not find the possibility to add an Outlook calendar there. Do you have any suggestions for it?;1
Go overall application. I wish it was easier to make changes in already established recurring appointments and it would be nice to have a refresh button. Everything else works really well.;1
Great app! The only thing I miss is syncing tasks with other accounts than Google, like CalDav.;1
Ads have changed from a small bar at the bottom to a full page screen that you could close to a full screen video that you can't close until you watch the whole thing.;1
I really like using buisness calendar. Whats missing for me is a windows version with an option to sync between phone and pc.;1
Simply the BEST Business Calendar, I have use for ordinary and very Busy People;1
Was using contacts + but ran out of space with an upgraded version so without warning it stopped saving contacts. Poor idea!!! Found Business Call 2 pro & am still discovering new features. Amazing app!;1
I really love how i can see my task list and calendar side by side. The only reason why im not giving it a 5 is because i would really love a desktop version to use when im on my laptop.;1
I have a built in calendar in my phone which i use for personal use. Then i downloaded this app which i wanna use for business purposes. But whenever i add an event, it will linked to my personal calendar. How can I separate the event, only in my business calendar? I dont wanna mix all together;1
Nice format views and options. My only suggestion is to improve the options that can be assigned when creating a new event.;1
If only the authors would fix the issue with the wrong person displayed after clicking on the birthday box, I would consider paying for the premium version;1
Nice app. Although, the full screen ads are pretty annoying.;1
I use free version and its useful for everyday tasks. 4 stars because there are too many ads.;1
I used to really love this app. Too many ads for 5 stars now - but I upstill like the way it works.;1
The best calendar application. The only improvement area is quick sync. It doesn't sync as quickly as Google calendar.;1
Pretty good calendar app. I like the layout of the Samsung calendar app a little better but this one has more features.;1
Simple interface, clear display, not explored advanced features -- does the job for me.;1
I was using this app for years and I'm used to it but those ads are so annoying. It's sad for me to look for other options. You should leave those ads out;1
Very reliable but not great at retaining future appointments over one year. They seem to disappear!;1
Great for keeping track of events and appointments!;1
Good tool to manage one or more calendars in one view. Connects to gmail, contacts, phone, google drive and more;1
Love the way it can be easily zoomed for both size and number of days.;1
Good experience in the past but too much advertisement recently!! It makes the experience quite bad ...;1
been a few years - I just use it, which says a lot of positive about the design.;1
Pretty good calender app. Would like the ability to set multiple alarms for single events though.;1
No issues so far...integrates nicely with all the software I use.;1
Very pleased with the interface and overall functional capabilities of the app.;1
"Very user friendly. I'm not very ""techie"" but this is easy.";1
It was awesome , but they started ads. Now im switching to another app.;1
Nice interface, simple to use. Good widget.;1
Hi Team, I paid for pro version but ended up rebooting my phone. Now, it is asking me to pay again. How can I get my pro access again? I paid for it on March 16, 2020.;1
Updated as I have bought the pro version for 5 bucks and it works really well.;1
Great calendar, although the long and often advertisements get a little much though;1
Just wish the app would sync so I can use it on my new phone! Excellent otherwise. Thank you!!!;1
Very good. Sometimes aggressive advertisement.;1
Incredible, the best app of organization.;1
Great app however I am unable to connect with outlook anymore and I need to use outlook calendar;1
Calendar shares well but drops previous dates too quickly.;1
Great app but voice quality sometimes poor;1
Great calendar app. Easy to use.;1
I love this app, but have one major disappointment - when I input something in the calendar that lasts more than one day, it doesn't show a solid bar of colour from day 1-last day. Usually at least the first or last day (or both) show up as a separate event. It is very annoying and confusing.;1
Good but, too many ads..;1
Love it, some pay features are annoying;1
Easy to see event on gadget.;1
Really good calendar app. I like that they have now added a larger range of colours. They took away a feature I used and I don't use everything available, but it's easy to use and I'm keeping it :);1
Bought the paid version and this was working exceptionally well until recently. My Gmail entries now only appear for the last two years, or so, and not beyond. The Google calendar shows them all, so not sure why it's not synching fully.;1
Bought the pro version and it does the job. Only improvement I would suggest is an indicator showing how long a timed profile has before changing. Also, what it will change to.;1
Very useful and functional.;1
Very good app. The synchronization with outlook is not always happening, somehow, but it is generally very reliable.;1
I like the usability and design a lot. Unfortunately it has to be synced with your normal calender which is a deal breaker for me. I wanted to seperate work from my private life to keep a work life balance. It's sadly not possible with this app.;1
Thought one drive would be included in the cloud list.;1
Very Helpful and Reliable;1
Much easier to view than most .;1
Pls make agenda scrolling in the widget possible again. Galaxy S7 +++ CM Launcher +++;1
Keeps pushing me to rate the app even though I already have (and gave you 5 stars) LOSES A STAR.;1
Runs smoothly with all my mailing programs at a time: outlook, Gmail, roundcube. Maybe a little design update needed, but the best mailing app I have used so far. An integration of Google maps for addresses of meetings (in the premium version at least) would be nice!;1
"Better reminder system is needed. Setting do not seem to ""stick""";1
I've had this app for many years as it used to be the best. It's had some difficulties the past couple but they are improving again.;1
Update: still like the app, but now there are annoying timed ads stuck in after saving or editing, so I am taking off 1 star. Very customizable including the widget. I can make it whatever size i want and show me what is coming up at a glance.;1
Great;1
Needs a backup system;1
Wish it wou.d sync better to audio all calenders that I have in google;1
Very useful. Clearly laid out. Update in 2020:. Excellent app.;1
Sometimes doesn't synch over devices.;1
The calendar should be able to set up recurring events easier. Updated: The calendar still makes it difficult to define a recurring date that occurs on the 3rd Monday, 1st Thursday, etc. It should be more intuitive. Also, it should allow you to define the event type better instead of just birthdays, anniversaries, etc. A custom event type that is user defined would be nice, like job anniversary, named day, National BBQ Day, etc. How do you import a list of holidays from a file (HTML,TXT,XML) ?;1
The most feature rich, highly customizable calendar offered today. However, I wish I could add non holiday events like Mother's Day, Father's Day, Valentines Day, etc.;1
Great app with regular updates;1
Integrates nicely with all calendars;1
Much better calendar then the one that came with the phone.;1
The best ever.. Only bug when ur restart ur mobile;1
Good;1
Just paid for this app. Latest update, I've lost some events in 1 of the 4 Google calendars I view. Those events show up just fine in the Google Calendar, and used to show up o.k. My free Business Calendar. I see you did an update July 20. Maybe there is a bug in that version. I tried stopping the app, cleared cache, cleared all data, started over. Still missing some events in one calendar. Refresh/resync doesn't help. All events showing in Google Calendar. Shut down, restarted phone, not fixed.;1
Sometimes widgets don't update themselves and stay the same day.;1
before was fine. it just happen today that widget shows 'widget loading...' only. i try to resize widget, then it's back. it just a little bug, but hope you can fix.;1
Great app. Pulls together lots of info that keeps me in-the-know and sane.;1
I really like this calendar. It syncs well with my Google accounts - better than other 3rd party calendar apps I've tried. (I've only used the free version);1
Nice app;1
One of the few android apps I've been happy to pay for, and never regretted doing so!;1
I like that it keeps more than a years worth of data. For the most part, it is easy to use. The main complaint is having to struggle past ads fairly often. The good thing is that they don't last long. Ads are always irritating. It never used to lock the screen with ads.;1
Great app and a great team that answers questions. I do wish the theme would automatically change with all the other apps when placed in dark mode.;1
It has been working well with the exception of syncing. I have to manually do that once a or more.;1
I like this app. Hope you habe this on IOS;1
Bought the pro version and it does the job. Only improvement I would suggest is an indicator showing how long a timed profile has before changing. Also, what it will change to.;1
Awesome;1
I would appreciate have notification alerts in my lock screen...( android 10 );1
Nice;1
Very good app. The synchronization with outlook is not always happening, somehow, but it is generally very reliable.;1
Great without the ads😉;1
I've been using this app for about 2 years. I like the way you can customize so many aspects if you want but it is simple to use out of the box. I use the widget almost exclusively.;1
I love this app, but have one major disappointment - when I input something in the calendar that lasts more than one day, it doesn't show a solid bar of colour from day 1-last day. Usually at least the first or last day (or both) show up as a separate event. It is very annoying and confusing.;1
Really good calendar app. I like that they have now added a larger range of colours. They took away a feature I used and I don't use everything available, but it's easy to use and I'm keeping it :);1
Still enjoying this calendar app... but would like it better if it was a little more intuitive 😇;1
Not a big user, but my use is very satisfactory;1
The only problem I have is I really really miss the pop-up reminders, hopefully that will be brought back. But still by far the best calendar app I've tried. I used the original business calendar since it was first released many years ago.;1
Very Good;1
People;1
Very good app;1
Simply the BEST Business Calendar, I have use for ordinary and very Busy People;1
The month pop-up in weekly view doesn't work... Not sure why... Otherwise I'd give it 5*.;1
Sangat membantu untuk mengingatkan acara2 penting..;1
Very good;1
Top of my wish list is ability to copy and paste events. Other than that, great app.;1
So many features and options! Does not support Google calendar reminders.;1
Great App I can't live without. Just wish they would apply the HTML Code in Tasks so that I can write in bold, italic, etc and I can drag appointments around in Agenda View of the calendar. Good work guys. Keep it up!;1
Extremely smooth start and sync. Including reverse sync from app to calendar;1
Good;1
Easy to see event on gadget.;1
Very handy 👍;1
Great helping app, would be 5 if events won't disappear occasionally, possibly because calendar is shared between two gmails;1
Having problems. The app is not syncing anymore with my Google calendar. I double-checked the settings gs and permissions and tried to force a sync, still no good. It is set to auto sync every 3 hours. Edit: changed from 3 to 4 stars. I appreciate the suggestion to try and help. It didn't fix the issue. However with my new phone the app is working seamlessly. Very easy to use, lots of customization, visually easy to read. Thanks.;1
Does exactly what it is needed for.;1
Works really well;1
Incredible, the best app of organization.;1
Only complaint is the ads. Weren't there till 2020.;1
Works well;1
Good experience;1
Love it;1
I've been using it for a couple of years & it's worked well for me. I like being able to set reminders on tasks, something GTasks doesn't do by itself. I did spring for the paid version since i use it pretty heavily and to get the all-in-one widget. Worth it!;1
Very good app. Helps me keep organized, and does not let me forget anything. Also, syncs with the google account so I don't miss any dates. I would only suggest that they change all the tasks paid options to the free app, so we could have the opportunity to compartimentalize the complex tasks in projects and also to repeat the tasks daily or weekly, to achieve milestones and to track them. This app would become exceptional and dependable. Thank you, I know you will ponder my suggestion 🙏🏻😊;1
Very useful. Easy to plan daily schedule. Please keep on improving.;1
Love it. I'm self employed with several appointments a day. Being able to see my appointments at a quick glance is really helpful and a must for me.;1
This is the best calenders and task combination, I've found so far. I very much like the feature that allows multiple reminders. Syncing with Google calendar is still in development. Even though both allow tasks, subtasks and reminders, the syncing is not yet perfected. It would be great to see this done.;1
Good app. Let's you to add yearview which is unavailable in Google Calendar. I am using it for four years.;1
I would have given 5 stars if it was possible to sort tasks manually. I have been waiting for this feature for so long! Other than that, you really have tons of useful features 🙂;1
Exactly what l need and what l have been looking for... very easy to use. -Zimbabwe;1
Early I was able to register birth date in 'Birth Day' reminder and it reminded on the day with the age. As 'Mr Satish age 55.' That feature is missing.;1
Still using this app every day. Some of the best with frequent updates. Kudos to the developers!;1
Good.;1
Much easier to read than Google calendar;1
I like how it works. Though one massive thing I can't either figure out how to do (which is more likely the case). Or you just don't have a repeat of the same event without having scheduled it 6 separate times in one day. Like eat 6 times a day. Supplements 8 times. I think you get it. Other then that it's perfect for work. Quick and easy for me to keep my clients in there own lane and me on time.;1
Lowered to 4 stars because still can not use CalDAV to sync tasks, so they are only on the phone. Don't break the phone. Or you can use Google tasks if that's enough for you. Otherwise it's very good. I'm moving away from Google and this does do calendars via CalDAV. Use DAVx5 to sync.;1
Good;1
Cannot get any of the other calendars to show up other than my Gmail calendar. They're listed in the settings, I've got them checked, but nothing shows up on the main screen.;1
"Displaying the ""Contacts"" calendar of every Google account cannot be deactivated in Calendar & Tasks list (it re-activates immediately).";1
I have a built in calendar in my phone which i use for personal use. Then i downloaded this app which i wanna use for business purposes. But whenever i add an event, it will linked to my personal calendar. How can I separate the event, only in my business calendar? I dont wanna mix all together;1
Great app! The only thing I miss is syncing tasks with other accounts than Google, like CalDav.;1
Good;1
My go to calendar;1
Hi. When will it be integrated with the dark mode setting on your phone...?;1
I've been using the paid version for several years now. The calendar is well designed and I enjoyed everything it can offer. Recently though, there are sync issues with my google calendar. I sometimes have to do it manually.;1
One or two interface aspects I might wish to adjust. Would like event status to be reflected in it's display. Would like events to reflect their event-type category.;1
I like its efficiency Leaves me with a sense of confidence that once entered will remind me when it should. Completely satisfied.;1
Great for keeping track of events and appointments!;1
"Helpful although or right because I am still the kind of ""fountain pen letter writer""!";1
Best I could find for my needs;1
I really like using buisness calendar. Whats missing for me is a windows version with an option to sync between phone and pc.;1
Bought the paid version and this was working exceptionally well until recently. My Gmail entries now only appear for the last two years, or so, and not beyond. The Google calendar shows them all, so not sure why it's not synching fully.;1
There is a lot of good in this app, but I want to mention places that need improvement. There needs to be a setting for how often the app syncs with your calendars. Also, if you change a meeting time in outlook it doesn't seem to update in Business Calendar.;1
Nice interface, simple to use. Good widget.;1
Great;1
Nice app. Although, the full screen ads are pretty annoying.;1
"The hunt is over - perfect I have been using your app for years. Every six months or so I would explore a couple other apps in the PlayStore because I was looking for a 2-3 week view. They just released the ability to toggle how many weeks to display in the ""month view"" and this is absolutely dynamite. This app is now perfect. Thank you too the creators - Business Calendar 2 is an essential tool for me. I used it every day and will continue to refer people to this app 👍👍";1
I have been using this app for years now. I have tried other calendar apps on Android and IOS and this is by far my favorite apps. It may not have a bubbly interface like other calendars but the features are great, especially if you have multiple calendars to manage. The features that get added are helpful and useful as well. Thank you for a great app.;1
Very nice app, the only thing I am missing is a repetitive global reminder for Tasks. As an IT I have a lot of tasks to do and due to my extremely busy schedule I always forget to check the Task Lists. If I had a Global Popup Reminder for All the Tasks every 10-15-30 mins I think it will be much better. I need a popup reminder and the ability on that popup reminder to mark the tasks if they are completed or not. I have tried with the widget but is not helpful , thank you very much :);1
Incredibly well thought out and designed. So grateful I finally found a tool so perfect for my needs. I was starting to think maybe I was setting my standards too high or didn't know clearly enough exactly what I was looking for but nope, this is as close to perfect as I think anyone could ever ask for. Been a premium user for probably about a week, and I chose to leave this review on my own without being asked. Thank you, for creating this tool!;1
I've been using this calendar including the first version for years. It works well with Google Calendar. I also drop the link in for my son's soccer schedule. Every time I upgrade my phone I try their calendar to compare. No comparison. I prefer this app.;1
I've had this app for years- first the free app, now premium. I love being able to schedule tasks as well as events. I create different color-coded calendars for different categories of events, and it's really easy to sync calendars with my SO.;1
"Tried the basic version, liked it enough to buy the advanced version a week later!!! Best for the way I work, without distracting ""cutesy nonsense. "" I wanted a business calendar and that is what I got. STILL USING IN 2020.";1
Solid calendar app that works like a calendar should. I switched to this app from Google Calendar because I used to travel across 4 timezones for work, and I got tired of having to re-adjust all of my scheduled meetings each time I entered another timezone. I haven't looked back since switching.;1
Excellent calendar. I've been using this for years. I love that I can color code my events and put emojis for more of a visual effect. You can also in sync to other calendars and you can have multiple reminders. Highly recommended;1
I've been using the free version of Business Calendar for five years. It helps me track both my business and personal events. The event alarms help are life savers for my ADHD brain. Love this app.;1
Limited use to Galaxy 7 phone: Has worked very well for me. However, please add an icon that pops up to let me know how many messages I have. Because I don't get many messages, I don't check it daily or more like others do.;1
It's really easy to put appointments in and set reminders in it. My work schedule was hard to put in it at first, because I couldn't figure out how to put it in, but once I figured it out it wasn't a problem.;1
Been using the calendar for years now. The only problem is I can't figure out which app to keep, as I'm getting dual notifications from this app and Business Calendar Pro. What are the differences between Business Calendar Pro & Business Calendar 2;1
I have used Business Calendar for years now. It has been easy to use and shows me what I need. I keep looking at other apps that people tell me about but have not found anything better.;1
I've been using Business Calendar for years. I am very happy with the appearance, functionality, and synching with my Google calendar. Great product!;1
Spectacular in every regard! Everything is well thought out and implemented in a seamless way that integrates well with other apps and daily life.;1
Never fails...I suppose you expect that from an app but I've taken it for granted, and I shouldn't. It's reliable, easy to use, and I pull it out several times a day. It's never failed!;1
Great app. Been using it for years primarily due to the customization possibilities. The widgets are the best I've seen for any calendar app.;1
I think the app is great, to the point where I'll be buying the pro version, but there's something missing that I find very necessary: checklist functionality (not the same as subcategories, since checklists could be made for categories as well as subcategories). Other than that, I would highly recommend it;1
it has been years since I started using this app, after my father recommended it. also invested and got the premium. simple, efficient, clear, quick.;1
Been using this app or the one before it for years now. It's a great app that has only improved with time. Loving the new colors. Only thing I could wish for is a more customizable print page, but it's rare that I need to print my calendar. It's one of the few where I paid for the upgrade, mostly out of appreciation for a well done, well supported app. Not in any way affiliated with the app, nor did I receive anything for this review.;1
Still the best calendar app I've found. Nothing beats the month view and customizability. Can group calendars to display or hide as suits your needs.;1
Love it, love the widget. Used free for a few years and finally just bought it . It's worth the purchase. Extremely useful. We have all our business bookings in this calendar. It's so well thought out. Love the tasks and how you can refresh it in the widget. If you go to a new day that has a blank task you can click on the blank in the widget and it'll show you all your previous tasks and you can just refresh them to show them on your task list for the day. Weather is extremely accurate.;1
This App is user friendly and I use it daily to plan my whole day - personal & business- from my AM/PM routines, activities with family & friends, tutoring schedule, tracking & mangaging my Google tasks, appointments, etc. I use the color-coding option & add icons to ny tasks and events to add variety & clarity for quick reference. It is easy to employ time boxing as I can quickly change the dates & times as needed. It is the most efficient & effective scheduler & time tracker I have used.;1
Great Calender dose everything I need it to do. It is also easy to use and operate. I highly recommend using this Calender.;1
I've tried many calendar apps and this is my favorite. I've been using the pro version for many years as several devices.;1
Just simply does what it is supposed to do, easy to use. I have had this app for years, no thought to change. Very happy with this app.;1
This is a great app, very intuitive and easy to use. My only complaint is that when opening from the widget it always owns into week view and doesn't remember that I have set month view as my preferred. Still, everything else is brilliant, so definitely deserves 5 stars.;1
Fantastic app which helps to keep me organised. I have used it for over three years now. Keep up the good work.;1
Our team has tried every app for ease of use and quick edits when viewing many employees' calendars at once - BC2 wins by FAR. The iPhone users are jealous 😈 But please... get this on the apple app store so they can use it too 🤞;1
Works without problems and does what I need. Have used about a year now. Best calendar I have ever had.;1
superb calendar. the repeating reminders work like a charm. the voice input is reliable.;1
Excellent app, allows all the information for appointments to be entered. No excuses for a missed meeting;1
I've used this app for years. It works great with Google Calandar and is continually updated and improved by the developer.;1
Finally a calendar that's functional, customizable and looks good! It shows everything I need, has a fantastic customizable widget, and the pro version is not expensive either. I love this calendar. Edit: I have now been using this calendar for over a year and it's still great. So appreciate this app for helping me stay organized!;1
Great app! Much better than the default google calendar with many additional features.;1
I use it mostly offline until I want to sync for backup. Less interruptions that way.;1
Best tiny investment ever!!! I have been using this app for many years. Over time I have trialled new calendar apps 'for interest sake' and have found there is nothing that is as customisable, easily edited or functional to manage both personal and work related events, appointments and tasks all in one place. Keep up the great work APPGENIX.;1
Love the flexibility of this app. It works hard like me and makes organization of tasks and schedules seamless;1
Very practical, supports multiple calendars, both Google calendar and locally stored ones, data exports...;1
Best organizer out there. Easy to use and has an intuitive layout.;1
I have an odd schedule for work (4 week rotation) and this app let's you customize really well in reoccurring events such as this. I also have another shared email address for band gigs that I was able to sync up. I can now switch between each one and create, edit, or delete whatever events I need to. I recommend this app. The only negative that is slightly annoying is the more you use it, it has a list that pops up of past events you created when creating one and sometimes duplicates the name.;1
Very helpful app. Well organize. No problems. Highly recommended..;1
Honestly the best calendar app ever. I have tried a number of different calendar apps. But liked this one the best.;1
The most innovative and intuitive and customizable calendar on the Android planet! You'd be wasting your quarantined time looking far anything better!;1
Been using this app since 2008. Love it. Used the free version for a few years, but the pro is worth the few extra bucks. Bought it for my wife as well. Consolidates my dozen calendars from Google and Exchange and has awesome customization features. It keeps getting better, so I won't nit-pick where it might improve.;1
I enjoy using this app on a daily basis. Especially like the opportunity to copy and paste events.;1
Very robust and user friendly. I like that it has a lot of useful features!;1
This is the best full feature calendar for the price! Just buy it don't waste time on free this is the best.;1
Amazing and easy to use! This app has features that I can't seem to find in any other calendar apps and was well worth buying the pro version for. I love that I'm able to duplicate an event to multi-days, slide to rearrange event times and delete many reminders (without having the app exit out after deleting like other apps do). The widgets are also useful for a quick glance at my calendar. I highly recommend this app over other calendar apps!;1
This app is very easy to use and syncs with your Google calendar!;1
Would like option to have rounded corners in the widget. Love that it's the most customisable calendar I have tried.;1
Good app. Have tried a few of the others. I continue to stay with this one for its featured.;1
One of the best calendar apps on any platform. Highly recommend the premium version!;1
Works great with multiple calendar services simultaneously, in particular GCal and MS Exchange.;1
I love this app! It's so user friendly and helps me keep track of everything going on!;1
have depended on this cal app for years. love the display options. monthly view is my go to and can be crammed with text. love the time input clock, multiple reminders. still features I've not explored.;1
I think the app I great! I just have the basic free version, but it has everything I need.;1
This is my go to calendar app. I like the interface and ease of use better than others i have tried;1
Much better than google calendar. Especially in handling the change of repeated events;1
The widget is amazing! I use it all the time. Excellent product. It just works.;1
Best calendar app I've ever used, going a quite a few years now... Could barely function without it!;1
I can perfectly harmonize my personal and business life with this app for more than two years now. I still can share private calendars with the rest of the family, can decide who sees what and finally what event can squeeze in or not. I use reminders to take me in right time so I need no personal assistent or secretary. Multiple calendars is a must. WELL DONE.;1
I bought the Pro version and I'm so happy with this app. I can organise everything and it works with Gmail too. Beautiful, simple, easy to use and customizable! I'm using it since one year now.;1
Awesome... Been using this app (paid version) for about 6 years. It has never failed me and has never, in my opinion.. had a bad update. Gets better all the time... Big thanks to the developers and maintenance peeps....;1
Have used this app x years. Able to easily plan with my husband since I am able to view his calendar.;1
Cool app for scheduling. Few hiccups sometime but still good.;1
This app has made my life significantly easier to manage appointments, schedule meetings & keep track of things. The resent updates with more colors makes everything easier to manage at a quick glance.;1
Love the selections I have to highlight my different activities with color on my calendar.;1
Best. I try many calendars. This - the best. I use it for a 3 years. And this month buy pro version.;1
Great reliable calendar app. Been using this for years. Not let me down.;1
I have used it for four years. Has all the features you could need at a great price. No bugs. Update: I got SUPER excited about the 35 new additional colors 😅;1
This Calendar is excellent providing a wide range of very useful capabilities for tasks, events and celebration dates and formatting which are very well designed and functional. Regular updates improve the app with very useful additions.;1
"Best calendar app for Android I've found by far. It would be nice it there was a version for windows as well but as it all syncs nicely with Google it's not a problem, just a "" would be nice to have""";1
I was searching for business calendar apps when I came upon this. Didn't need to try other apps when I used it. Even the free version feels like a premium business calendar.;1
Have been using this app for years. I love how easy it is to use and the preference options. They also continue to update and fix bugs.;1
Great app. My go to calendar. Use it every day.;1
Great app! I use this all the time. Very customizable;1
Very happy with this calendar. Have been using it for years. Thank you.;1
Love this calendar, it syncs great with my Google calendar. Love the ability to color code different work and personal functions. I recommend it highly.;1
great functionality. frequent meaningful updates. handles multiple calendars seamlessly. useful day, week, month, and year views. responsive support.;1
Wonderful feature flexibility between several calendars. I am recommending my entire office use it. I have the paid version and the one time $4 is absolutely worth it.;1
Moving or adding appointments is easy. Many useful features the I would not have expected a free app to have.;1
I use this app everyday to keep track of appointments, birthdays and things to do. Love the reminder feature This app is a life saver.;1
Solid app, good features. I've used the free version for a while and the ads are there but not overwhelming.;1
Great app. Would have been a 5 if had more color options....... Update: I give it a 5+....recent update gives virtually unlimited color options for events!;1
Been using the pro version for a long time and it's the best Android calendar out there. It has everything you need. No reason to look anywhere else.;1
Very easy, simple to use. It syncs with my Google Calendar but with a much better layout than Google Calendar.;1
I just love everything about it! It's productive and efficient in managing multiple calendars and optimal snooze options missing elsewhere.;1
Best Calendar app by far. There are several customization options and the app in general looks beautiful. I would highly recommend this to anyone.;1
Brilliant app, Easy to use , practical for anyone who need to make an order in your personal life, business etc.;1
Great calendar. It's the only calendar I've found that displays a full agenda including a full description of the event etc.;1
I have been using the paid version of this calendar for some time and am very happy with it. Well worth upgrading to avoid ads.;1
Great all around. Love the widget. Sync can be a bit more agile, but not a big deal.;1
Very useful. However some features are limited from premium you can still do quite a lot and the interface is cool;1
Easy to use and dependable. Love the that you can customize colors and fonts.;1
Great all rounder for day to day, projects and events. I have used it now for a number of years.;1
Tried the free version, it was useful enough to buy the paid version. It's a good calendar app.;1
Great app, and very useful for keeping tabs on meetings, and other key diary events.;1
Happy with it.;1
Awesome;1
Loved it;1
4 years later, still my go to calendar app.;1
Very good and useful;1
This calendar is perfect for all my business and personal appointments.;1
Really helpful;1
Best calendar app ever. Better than any. Thanks creators!;1
Very effective!;1
Awesome tool for aggregating and curating calendars. Home screen widgets allow me to quickly glance at business calendars on one page and quickly swipe to the calendars my wife and I use to manage our personal lives.;1
Easy to use;1
I have used this app for years. After a little time first using it, I got the paid version.;1
Love the selections I have to highlight my different activities with color on my calendar.;1
Still love this app. It is the best calender app I have found. Also syncs to all devices. Thanks for your great service. Christine Reed 2020-Still love this calender! Use it everday for everything personal & professional. Couldn't get thru the day or nighr without it!!!!;1
I have like four calendars available on my phone, but this is the only one I use. It's easy and well-organized. No ads.;1
Great Calender dose everything I need it to do. It is also easy to use and operate. I highly recommend using this Calender.;1
My calendar workhorse .;1
"Tried the basic version, liked it enough to buy the advanced version a week later!!! Best for the way I work, without distracting ""cutesy nonsense. "" I wanted a business calendar and that is what I got. STILL USING IN 2020.";1
Update Aug 2020: I've been using this app for over 3 years now and I still love it! Previously I had probably tried every calendar app on the market, switching every few months. Love that BC2 combines my calendar and tasks in one place. I also love that it is fully customizable so I can get the exact look I want for the app and widgets. I honestly can recall a time when the app glitched or had issues! The developers take good care of this app (thank you!)!;1
Still the best calendar app I've found. Nothing beats the month view and customizability. Can group calendars to display or hide as suits your needs.;1
Perfectly customizable and Google compatible calendar;1
I used all of my daily activities here Im lost if i lost this app.;1
Good app. Have tried a few of the others. I continue to stay with this one for its featured.;1
Very happy with this calendar. Have been using it for years. Thank you.;1
Much better than google calendar. Especially in handling the change of repeated events;1
I use the app daily. It works well;1
Good app;1
Great app and helpful;1
I've been using the free version of Business Calendar for five years. It helps me track both my business and personal events. The event alarms help are life savers for my ADHD brain. Love this app.;1
Been using it for years. Awesome;1
Great app and very helpful for my use;1
Works and sync's well.;1
Great;1
Very good calendar and appointment keeper;1
Best calendar app I've ever used, going a quite a few years now... Could barely function without it!;1
Excellent;1
I have been using this app for several years now and it is perfect!! Had tried several others previously, but this is superior. It has never crahed or mis functioned. It also allows you to have several reminders. Great Calendar App!!;1
Never fails...I suppose you expect that from an app but I've taken it for granted, and I shouldn't. It's reliable, easy to use, and I pull it out several times a day. It's never failed!;1
Been using the calendar for years now. The only problem is I can't figure out which app to keep, as I'm getting dual notifications from this app and Business Calendar Pro. What are the differences between Business Calendar Pro & Business Calendar 2;1
Works fine! Very handy organizational tool!;1
I have used Business Calendar for years now. It has been easy to use and shows me what I need. I keep looking at other apps that people tell me about but have not found anything better.;1
Track future and historical vary well.;1
"Been using the app for years now and all I can say is ""Thanks BC2!""";1
This continues to be my 'go to' app for appointments. I truly appreciate the ability to have this app send you an email as an appointment reminder.;1
Super Kalender App;1
Very excellent itself;1
Nach wie vor, 10 Sterne von 5 Sternen! Ne wirklich runde Sache!;1
Have been using this for almost 3 years now and no complaints so far;1
easy to use.;1
Customizable views, includes tasks, and easy to key on off multiple read only calendars. The best way to negotiate multiple scheduled. update 2020 : still great and best customizable calendar display;1
My default calendar!;1
I love this app! It's so user friendly and helps me keep track of everything going on!;1
Using it for years now. I'm quite satisfied.;1
Leider gibt es scheinbar keine Unterstützung für DAVdroid Accounts, z.B. für owncloud Nutzer. Das gab es noch in der alten Version. Damit ist die neue Version leider noch unbrauchbar.;1
Easy and organized!;1
I've been using this calendar including the first version for years. It works well with Google Calendar. I also drop the link in for my son's soccer schedule. Every time I upgrade my phone I try their calendar to compare. No comparison. I prefer this app.;1
No fuss or bother. Has everything you need to stay organised.;1
Love it!;1
Been using it for almost 4 years. Very happy with it.;1
Fantastic app which helps to keep me organised. I have used it for over three years now. Keep up the good work.;1
Great!;1
Very Good;1
Very practical, supports multiple calendars, both Google calendar and locally stored ones, data exports...;1
Just works great app.;1
Good one;1
I've had this app for years- first the free app, now premium. I love being able to schedule tasks as well as events. I create different color-coded calendars for different categories of events, and it's really easy to sync calendars with my SO.;1
Excellent ap. Like the many configurations and the ap does well to monitor 10 different email accounts.;1
Best organizer out there. Easy to use and has an intuitive layout.;1
I've been using Business Calendar for years. I am very happy with the appearance, functionality, and synching with my Google calendar. Great product!;1
Very nice App.;1
Great reliable calendar app. Been using this for years. Not let me down.;1
Use it constantly to keep family schedule in sync. Can't live without it!;1
long sustainable quality. have been using this as my primary business calendar for almost 5 years. very pleased with it.;1
...And more!;1
I use this many times daily, and have for YEARS. Very intuitive and easy to change views. I like the slider bar and the ability to quickly show or hide favorite calendars. Moving appointments is a breeze. I have both Google calendars and an outlook one - this app handles both beautifully. Cannot say enough good about it!!!!;1
Very useful app, many features!;1
Very helpful app. Well organize. No problems. Highly recommended..;1
Use it every day!!;1
Revised rating. Have been using this for a number of years now and I think it's brilliant.;1
Great App... Keep up the good work;1
Perfect;1
Excellent app, allows all the information for appointments to be entered. No excuses for a missed meeting;1
Reliable and adaptable;1
Works great for my needs, I love it!;1
Love this app;1
I have tried a lot of calendar apps and this is my favorite. Have been using it for more than 6 years. I like their updates. Widgets are really awesome;1
Using it for 5 years! Best planner/task app! I've tried them all...no problems with app and easy to use...;1
Worth the purchase.;1
Extremely useful, easy to use and integrates well with everything else I use.;1
The most innovative and intuitive and customizable calendar on the Android planet! You'd be wasting your quarantined time looking far anything better!;1
Perfect!;1
Excellent;1
love this calendar!;1
Works well. Intuitive.;1
Granted I'm only doing basic schedule management. Way better than the stock calendar I was using!;1
Easy to use!;1
Would like option to have rounded corners in the widget. Love that it's the most customisable calendar I have tried.;1
Very robust and user friendly. I like that it has a lot of useful features!;1
The best;1
I love the idea of this however when I log an all day event it goes over into the next day which makes it very annoying so I am unable to use. Please fix asap. Still not working, Please can you sort this because I want to be able to use it.;0
Horrible product. Difficult to use, does not do half of what is shown. I even bought a pen for my tablet, but still is not any where as easy to use as advertised. Waste of money. I'd give it zero stars, but that is not an option.;0
"Now hold on. I paid for the ""premium version"" a couple years ago for ad-free use. Decide to update the app for once and suddenly that's gone?";0
You cannot change the default online calendar. This does me no good to only have multiple local calendars.;0
Not a fan. I paid for the upgrade and it isn't working out for me. Maybe others will like it but I don't.;0
Extremely Disappointed. I had been a faithful user of this app and loved it. Then all of sudden everything changed. There is no cloud support. The tabs option is gone. There is no interface with established tasks list. I have tried and tried to use. I contacted support and they replied that due to streamlining the app it has a completely new appearance. I had uninstalled this app, however I felt I needed to write thos review. After I finish this, uninstalling this app. Useless to me.;0
I liked this app, even paid for it, but uninstalled it today due to weird behavior. I see two other reviews here with a similar problem. The app will periodically launch itself, but it's just a black screen, and it creates a copy of my home screen - looks the same but frozen until I hit the close button, then the copy scrolls away and I can again use my phone. Just odd.;0
I have used this app for years. I have always paid for the premium version. At first, it was my favorite app, but it has gotten steadily worse. Now it is very glitchy. It closes randomly and typically takes up to three minutes to open which is very embarrassing when I'm trying to set an appointment with a customer. It also randomly unchecks completed tasks and reverts to older versions of my schedule. The developers are uncaring and blame my phone (Note 8). I'm looking for a new app.;0
very invasive into data collection;0
I have had this app for 2 years and absolutely loved it, after an update it would cut on automatically and freeze my phone. I would have to hit the open apps and close it before I could do anything with my phone. I have emailed and explained what it was doing, and I get am email wanting more explanation, so I did. several days later I get an email that wants a video showing. I don't think this will get fixed i paid for the pro version and i will not renew;0
This app used to be great. Now it is garbage. A few months ago it started doubling a few tasks - no problem, I just delete the extras. Now I get 5 to 10 copies of every task I delete. It is worthless.   I can't forget the wait times to open the app, up to 8 minutes of staring at a black screen.   Oh, and the fact that in the past week or two it started giving me ads even though I have been using the paid version for years already.   I let them know a couple weeks ago and got no response.;0
NOTE TO SELF::: The demo version of this app is totally useless - so there is no way of knowing if this product will be able to meet my needs BEFORE paying for the premium version. I'll find another way to get my needs met. I'm sure there are other products available for free that would do the same things. Since I'm not allowed to testdrive all the bells and whistles - I am passing this app over. No thanks. UNINSTALLING.;0
I thought upgrading and paying the $8 fee would allow me to use all of the functions of this app. It does not. I Haven't been able to sync any of my devices . Absolutely will not let me add an event. This was a waste of time and money. If I can't add my schedule on my lap top version then there's no point to this app. Plus there's no support or anyone to contact to help trouble shoot or credit me back .;0
the app opens it self up whenever it wants to display an ad but the screen remains the same but i cant press anything. so it just opens up in the background all day long to display ads and make money when im not even using the app. this feature is ridiculous and it started happening every 5 minutes as opposed to every now and then so i just deleted the app.;0
Was great at first, but a new bug makes it so that every time I unlock my phone i have to press the “home” button twice to be able to use my phone at all. I know that it is this app causing the problem as when I click on the recently used apps tab after the bug occurs, this app is always the only one shown. I will have to uninstall now because of this.;0
I tried adding the pro for $7.99 because I thought you could set daily reminders by just marking repeat daily it doesn't do that or any of the things I was hoping for, I have had it less than 24 hours and would like a refund, I have sent emails asking for help and haven't received anything back so I just want my money back and this app gone!;0
I use to love this app. It is the perfect organizer with great features. However for the last month+ it barely opens. I am lucky if it will actually open twice a day. The app will say not responding, opens to a black page, or doesn't do anything but freeze my phone momentarily. My life is saved into this app so I am so frustrated!!;0
This basically is just a purple version of Google calendar. It has the almost exact same layout as Google calendar without any extra features. I wanted to use this as planner for school seperate from my calendar but there was no way to have it not sync with Google. Don't bother getting this app just use calendar directly.;0
Doesn't look like the pictures at all. Exact same layout as your phone's calendar. Now new settings etc. Waste of time app.;0
don't bother with this planner app. there are lots of other apps that do the same thing. this app has intrusive ads thats pop up at random. if you close the app and open a different app planner pro will open a pop up on the new app your using. seriously don't even bother with this BS;0
Could not get the app to save event time properly. All I wanted was to put a due date between 11:50 p.m. and 11:59 p.m. on a certain day. WOULD NOT do it. The app kept automatically changing my times. That's annoying enough for me to ditch it and move on.;0
Cannot get it to work on my Huawei P20. I have tried 3 times and cannot get it to sign in. It looks like it works fine on my iPad because I can sign up and get in but on my phone I am unable to do either. I needed something that I could use on both devices but am unable to get into in ob my phone;0
could be better. pls fix the 'repeat' setting where i could accually pick the exact date and time. for example i have to study during mondays, tuesdays and fridays at 8 pm. the app isn't very specific about it deeming it useless to me. hoping for a better update.;0
I have been using this for more than a year now, it was great, this is where i jot down notes on my classes and meetings, but this new update may have a bug i cant access it even with the correct pin i have entered Pls fix this issue, thanks;0
App became unusable with 11/06/18 update. Now the app takes 30-45 to open up after I click it and then I'm get an annoying ad that plays that I can't close for another 5-10 seconds. I'll be finding a new calendar app.;0
This is a great planner but I'm really annoyed that having previously paid for the Pro version I am now expected to pay an annual fee!!!;0
ANNOYED paid for this years ago PAID full version and used it and recommended it! Now I am asked to pay YEARLY to remove ads! what joke! I paid for full add free version already and there is nothing new to justify the yearly purchase...;0
This app sucks if you dont have the Pro version. I only had for a few min and couldn't do more than add a task. I tried to add an event, and wanted to sync chromebook to cell but it wouldn't let me.;0
Got a new phone and app now won't allow me to hit sign in button. Customer service is very slow to respond to help. Love the app for last 2 / 3 yrs but not being able to use now is not worth my $$$ paid for it & to think it just renewed;0
I received a notice from planner pro this morning when I went to schedule some appts. it notifies me I cannot use the app until payment received. iI checked my bank and payment was made on 01/26/2019. I will be cancelling as unable to use.;0
It won't allow you to create an account with e-mail address and password. Why give you the option but then doesn't work when you use it. If not resolved within a week uninstalling app.;0
I was really excited about this app but when I went to create an account it did not work. I tried logging in with my google account but it still didn't work. I am very disappointed;0
Will not accept passcode after today's update. Have been a paid user for some time and NEED my info back. Please fix and I will update my review. Useless to me until resolved.;0
Infested with ads now. Downloaded to specifically view one calendar and set it so but it automatically syncs my Samsung and gmail calendars automatically every time I open it.;0
Lmao this app is so bad. Setting events is a pain, time zones don't work, the from time and to time of an event don't work. If you trust this app for your planning. I'm sure you'd go mad because of missing important meetings due to wrong time setting. Just use Microsoft Outlook etc and pay for it. This one is a waste of time;0
Too many ads, and it doesn't automatically save your work. Also, everytime I exit, and reopen it, it brings me to a different page than I was on.;0
it's simple enough to set up a task or event..but not once has it reminded me as set to. so looking for one that will.;0
Can't sign in. And there are reviews from October saying the same. So... No improvement over months of having the same issue.;0
Doesn't work offline. requires internet and information. So not personal as it is over the internet. Sorry did not get past first screen requiring sign up... UNINSTALLED.;0
Shows annoying full screen ads that pop up from time to time!;0
This app is not worth the $6 a year. Poorly developed with several glitches.;0
I liked it at first, even paid for it too but now it won't sync across my devices so I need to find something else that will;0
This app launches itself with an invisible overlay over my home screen. That is EXTREMELY suspect behavior and therefore uninstalling.;0
Amazingly useful app with horrible glitches every week when all checked tasks become undone and overdue and default calendar changed by itself.;0
Closing and crashing when adding tasks and project. Support answering but doesn't help.;0
I loaded the app on to my Amazon Fire. It will only display horizontally and I dont have the export option even though I have the Premium subscription. I can't export my Task list either.;0
In order to actually use the app as a planner, you have to pay money. Very misleading and dissapointing.;0
Can't get account created. Tried linking facebook and straight account creation... will not let me progress past sign in page.;0
Please fixed it. Why i can't login my passcode. Damnly. Alot of doc i ve save inside;0
Suddenly not displaying all other calendars. And after reinstalling, app won't open.;0
when opening a sub-task from any view, the sub-task window does not even show the main list/task it is from;0
I cannot even create an account I fill in what's needed and I'm pressing the button and it's not working some1 help.;0
I can't get new password. It sends message: email is not available.;0
over basic, definitely not worth 200 per year. pictures shown are not what the app looks like.;0
Closes everytime I try to add a note, event or anything else since last update;0
I can't get a refund and the app doesn't work. Google play is zero help and I can't reach a developer! I've been robbed.;0
uninstalled once i realized there are ads and it wipes your current Google calendar.;0
took $ before the renewal date. have not recieved my refund and canceled on the due date.;0
well I just got it and attempted to.create an account and after unfilled out the info it would not submit it. what gives;0
Cannot log in on other devices.;0
purchased the plus version and now with the update to pro, I no longer have my premium features.;0
Doesn't update changes live or correctly, even. Was a waste of money for some basic app.;0
uninstalled, it interferes with my normal Google calendar.;0
Rollback, right after editing.. pls fix this!;0
I couldn't even make an account. It wont work;0
I lost all of my notes, and it wouldn't accept my passcode to get in any more so I deleted it and installed it again, then logged in and all of my stuff was gone. Please help, I need it back.;0
The app does not work after last nights update;0
Couldn't even create a log in.;0
It says you are downloading the pro version which is a complete lie.;0
Why does this basic app need access to my contacts and refuse to work without? Give me a break you filthy parasites.;0
Completed tasks continue to reappear;0
I see no difference in this and Google calendar;0
Wont let me create an account;0
App has stopped opening;0
Never use this app, only a little bit!;0
I couldn't even log in;0
Want use only not sharing;0
1 star for obligatory signup using Google /fb/twitter.;0
Would not let me create a log in.;0
Cannot access the app;0
Too complicated when putting on data. I'll stay with my diary.;0
Nope,all i ever wanted was to keep track of my stuff durring winter break,and no im an eight year old,and i have to enter an email,please god no god save this app;0
Won't even let me make a new account. Unusable.;0
wouldnt let me make an regular account without linking something to it.;0
This is just a re-skinned Samsung calendar, don't waste your time;0
Who puts ads on a calendar?! Y'all that desperate for money smh.;0
Trash dont waste ur time unless u want to pay for the things that should b free;0
cant use if i dont allow permission for contacts? dumb;0
This app deleted my whole google calender;0
will not be using ever again.;0
I don't care for the dashboard;0
Not as advertised;0
Piece of poo;0
Got a new tablet which sync my notes fine after I uninstalled and signed back in. My new phone won't sync. On the app for my phone there is no place to sign out! Frustrating;0
Lousy app;0
So disappointing!!! I used to love this app bit over the last few months it is Sooooooo glitchy! I just spent an hour deleting and checking off tasks from my to do list and everytime I think Im done, they show back up in triplicate!! Everything I changed IS STILL THERE AFTER AN HOUR!!! DOES THAT SOUND LIKE A GOOD TIME MANAGEMENT PROGRAM????? AND NO WAY TO CONTACT SUPPORT BECAUSE WHEN I TRY TO GET TO THE MENU IT SHOWS A BLACK SCREEN!!!!!;0
I loved this app, but until they get rid of the yearly charge after making us buy it to begin with I'll keep this at a 1. I did previously have this as 5 star, but I can't stand companies doing stuff like this.;0
,infoo;0
i hate it😠;0
I love the idea of this however when I log an all day event it goes over into the next day which makes it very annoying so I am unable to use. Please fix asap. Still not working, Please can you sort this because I want to be able to use it.;0

I know that it is this app causing the problem as when I click on the recently used apps tab after the bug occurs, this app is always the only one shown. I will have to uninstall now because of this.;0
the app opens it self up whenever it wants to display an ad but the screen remains the same but i cant press anything. so it just opens up in the background all day long to display ads and make money when im not even using the app. this feature is ridiculous and it started happening every 5 minutes as opposed to every now and then so i just deleted the app.;0
I have used this app for years. I have always paid for the premium version. At first, it was my favorite app, but it has gotten steadily worse. Now it is very glitchy. It closes randomly and typically takes up to three minutes to open which is very embarrassing when I'm trying to set an appointment with a customer. It also randomly unchecks completed tasks and reverts to older versions of my schedule. The developers are uncaring and blame my phone (Note 8). I'm looking for a new app.;0
Doesn't update changes live or correctly, even. Was a waste of money for some basic app.;0
took $ before the renewal date. have not recieved my refund and canceled on the due date.;0
purchased the plus version and now with the update to pro, I no longer have my premium features.;0
will not be using ever again.;0
I cannot even create an account I fill in what's needed and I'm pressing the button and it's not working some1 help.;0
I loved this app, but until they get rid of the yearly charge after making us buy it to begin with I'll keep this at a 1. I did previously have this as 5 star, but I can't stand companies doing stuff like this.;0
not great.....;0
This is a great planner but I'm really annoyed that having previously paid for the Pro version I am now expected to pay an annual fee!!!;0
I liked this app, even paid for it, but uninstalled it today due to weird behavior. I see two other reviews here with a similar problem. The app will periodically launch itself, but it's just a black screen, and it creates a copy of my home screen - looks the same but frozen until I hit the close button, then the copy scrolls away and I can again use my phone. Just odd.;0
I have had this app for 2 years and absolutely loved it, after an update it would cut on automatically and freeze my phone. I would have to hit the open apps and close it before I could do anything with my phone. I have emailed and explained what it was doing, and I get am email wanting more explanation, so I did. several days later I get an email that wants a video showing. I don't think this will get fixed i paid for the pro version and i will not renew;0
ANNOYED paid for this years ago PAID full version and used it and recommended it! Now I am asked to pay YEARLY to remove ads! what joke! I paid for full add free version already and there is nothing new to justify the yearly purchase...;0
This app launches itself with an invisible overlay over my home screen. That is EXTREMELY suspect behavior and therefore uninstalling.;0
,infoo;0
I can't get new password. It sends message: email is not available.;0
it's simple enough to set up a task or event..but not once has it reminded me as set to. so looking for one that will.;0
when opening a sub-task from any view, the sub-task window does not even show the main list/task it is from;0
cant use if i dont allow permission for contacts? dumb;0
This app used to be great. Now it is garbage. A few months ago it started doubling a few tasks - no problem, I just delete the extras. Now I get 5 to 10 copies of every task I delete. It is worthless.   I can't forget the wait times to open the app, up to 8 minutes of staring at a black screen.   Oh, and the fact that in the past week or two it started giving me ads even though I have been using the paid version for years already.   I let them know a couple weeks ago and got no response.;0
Cannot log in on other devices.;0
I received a notice from planner pro this morning when I went to schedule some appts. it notifies me I cannot use the app until payment received. iI checked my bank and payment was made on 01/26/2019. I will be cancelling as unable to use.;0
Won't even let me make a new account. Unusable.;0
Can't get account created. Tried linking facebook and straight account creation... will not let me progress past sign in page.;0
Could not get the app to save event time properly. All I wanted was to put a due date between 11:50 p.m. and 11:59 p.m. on a certain day. WOULD NOT do it. The app kept automatically changing my times. That's annoying enough for me to ditch it and move on.;0
Amazingly useful app with horrible glitches every week when all checked tasks become undone and overdue and default calendar changed by itself.;0
i hate it😠;0
I thought upgrading and paying the $8 fee would allow me to use all of the functions of this app. It does not. I Haven't been able to sync any of my devices . Absolutely will not let me add an event. This was a waste of time and money. If I can't add my schedule on my lap top version then there's no point to this app. Plus there's no support or anyone to contact to help trouble shoot or credit me back .;0
uninstalled once i realized there are ads and it wipes your current Google calendar.;0
Shows annoying full screen ads that pop up from time to time!;0
uninstalled, it interferes with my normal Google calendar.;0
Want use only not sharing;0
This app deleted my whole google calender;0
don't bother with this planner app. there are lots of other apps that do the same thing. this app has intrusive ads thats pop up at random. if you close the app and open a different app planner pro will open a pop up on the new app your using. seriously don't even bother with this BS;0
Who puts ads on a calendar?! Y'all that desperate for money smh.;0
This app sucks if you dont have the Pro version. I only had for a few min and couldn't do more than add a task. I tried to add an event, and wanted to sync chromebook to cell but it wouldn't let me.;0
Infested with ads now. Downloaded to specifically view one calendar and set it so but it automatically syncs my Samsung and gmail calendars automatically every time I open it.;0
I lost all of my notes, and it wouldn't accept my passcode to get in any more so I deleted it and installed it again, then logged in and all of my stuff was gone. Please help, I need it back.;0
App became unusable with 11/06/18 update. Now the app takes 30-45 to open up after I click it and then I'm get an annoying ad that plays that I can't close for another 5-10 seconds. I'll be finding a new calendar app.;0
Please fixed it. Why i can't login my passcode. Damnly. Alot of doc i ve save inside;0
I have been using this for more than a year now, it was great, this is where i jot down notes on my classes and meetings, but this new update may have a bug i cant access it even with the correct pin i have entered Pls fix this issue, thanks;0
Cannot access the app;0
I tried adding the pro for $7.99 because I thought you could set daily reminders by just marking repeat daily it doesn't do that or any of the things I was hoping for, I have had it less than 24 hours and would like a refund, I have sent emails asking for help and haven't received anything back so I just want my money back and this app gone!;0
Will not accept passcode after today's update. Have been a paid user for some time and NEED my info back. Please fix and I will update my review. Useless to me until resolved.;0
No;0
It says you are downloading the pro version which is a complete lie.;0
This new planner pro for which I paid for life is poorer than the previous version. I take ages to open, does not immediatly delete bring not all old tasks forward. Very bad.;0
It makes auto-copies of tasks. When you delete them, keep showing them again and again. Very annoying.;0
This app was fine for years and then became extremely laggy. It also started duplicating weekly tasks to the point that I would have to delete five or six versions of a task in order to return it to one weekly. Often the delete or complete options have to be used multiple times on the same task before it actually disappears. I have basically stopped using it except as a calendar, but it's so slow it's not even efficient to be used for that.;0
Nice looking app albeit does not seem to sync with Google calendar and not cross platform. Certainly cannot do $15/yr.;0
The widget stops working way to much.;0
I downloaded this app on my photo and it works great! But I just downloaded on my tablet for school and even though I used the same account, none of my events were there. It didnt sync right. I tried to restart, nothing. This app is good, just not for multiple devices.;0
"Great app But it forces you to sign in to something to use it, which is garbage. You should be able to use this without signing in. Backup and restore doesn't have to be via online accounts only, it can be ""export to file"" thing, which I preffer 100% of the time.";0
It's useful but it doesn't fully sync the events, tasks, and notes between devices. It's a huge inconvenience. Besides that I still love the app.;0
They are always changing Something after updates. And it isn't always functional like used to be;0
I have been using this for a while and found it to suit my needs well. I wanted something where I could see trasks and appointments in a daily view. This accomplished that goal in an easy to read and navigate format. However, there must have been a recent update that has made the ads ridiculously invasive to the point that I no longer want to use this app. I think I will start checking on alternate options.;0
Eh. it's mediocre and really doesn't do anything your calendar app on your phone doesn't already do. I liked using the month widget until it just decided, on Jan 29, that the month of February no loger existed. I tried to look ahead to the month of Feb to see a preview from the widget but it kept going fron Jan to March. The only way to view Feb in the widget was to change the date to Feb in my phone. just went back to my phone's calendar app. Uninstalling.;0
I loved this planner for several years with no issues. All of a sudden I can't launch the app or create/edit an event without getting a noisy, intrusive pop-up ads. I will be looking for a new option, possibly even just my stock calendar.;0
I was told to install Planner Pro instead of Planner Plus (which was what I already used) in order for my cell phone & iPad to sync. I have had at least 5 emails back & forth with the contact person but I still can't get my calendars linked using my email address as instructed. I guess I will have to go back to my Google calendar. I love the Planner Plus but need a calendar that syncs to both my cell and iPad.;0
Free Version does not allow you to view all your events in the monthly view. I only see colored dots that indicate an event is scheduled. I would like to see the event names. I contacted support, but sadly did not get a response.;0
Loved this app until I updated updated it. Gibberish on every day now. It is terrible. Like this on my phone and tablet!!!!! How do I fix. I depend on this planner!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;0
i think I could really like this app. except I upgraded to paid and still have ads and the search function does not search notes. It will be hard to find info saved in notes if you cant search...;0
DO NOT PAY FOR UPGRADE!! If you upgrade it just messes the app up. I have to manually change days every morning now. If it weren't for that, it'd be great. Please fix.;0
suddenly with ads and paid content disappeared, synchronization has some issues;0
Please fix the widget. It doesn't automatically update the day. It always shows yesterdays' date. Constantly having to remove and install widget.;0
it used to be a good app until they added the latest update which includes ridiculously annoying ads and frequent crashes.;0
Not very intuitive. I couldn't find a way to switch between week, day, or month views.;0
This is literally just another calendar app. Misleading calling it a planner. Smh. It's not even a good calendar. If you're hunting for a good planning app keep looking because this is definitely not it!!!;0
after reinstall data not recover while take backup Google Drive;0
Ver y often the application does not open, you sen question and ask what is happening, and you get No replied,, Roger J Sanchez from Miami;0
It's Google calendar with different color scheme;0
Pain. Ya have to create an account to access;0
notifications stopped working then it deleted all my tasks;0
It is doing a strange black screen thing, and randomly opens by itself (other reviews have mentioned this) and I suspect it is making my phone crash. My phone is crashing several times a day, when I remove the app it stops crashing. I hope there is a fix for this. It works just fine on my tablet, but not my phone. It's a great app due to its simplicity. I switched to another planner app today and will be requesting a refund.;0
I made several repeating tasks that are supposed to be repeated weekly by the day of the week. They seem to just multiply and now the same 4 tasks will show up 3 times each on a single day. I can't edit the original repeating ones, I can only delete them individually on the day they show up several times. This is VERY annoying. This app was a waste of my money. I paid for the ability to make repeating tasks. I'm very disappointed.;0
Was fine until the last couple of days when the layout turned squirrelly on my Android tablet.  Seems okay on my smart phone.  Still, I will not purchase full version unless the version for my tablet goes back to matching the screen layout on my cell.;0
"I've had this app for a few years, and it worked well until the last several months - it's gotten increasingly buggy and will do things like ""forget"" you checked off tasks as completed and re-list them as incomplete between closing and re-opening the app.  It also had been freezing more and more frequently, to the point where that happens at least once a day, and now I can't even load certain screens.  Because of this, I will not be renewing my subscription this year and will be using another app.";0
Uninstalled when I saw the app wanted me to pay a subscription fee as ransom for my data, I never will.;0
It sucks🖕🖕;0
I set weekly view in settings and for few days the app worked fine but today i tried to go back to months view and i tried to access settings but when i try to do that the app closes;0
"Widget is buggy - a task marked as completed in the app is displayed as overdue, and trying to tick it off in the widget takes me into edit mode. The proper app, when reopened, shows a blank inbox and revisiting the screen is required to populate it again. Poor punctuation (eg. ""28 Sep , 2017” - why the space before the comma) is not that big a deal, but also adds to the app not feeling very ""pro"".";0
i ws kinda disappointed because i really loved the user interface of the app and how smooth it flows from one set up to another. however, i have to uninstall and install it back up several time because it will not accept the 4digit password i have set it up with. i had to do it like 10 times :/ but still like the app tho. i hope that bug will be fixed sooner.;0
I really wanted to like this app, but it's just too buggy. Sometimes I open the app and it doesn't have the icons to switch views. Also the 12-hour formatting is really flawed. And the priority scale seems way too complex. High, medium, low should be enough for most people.;0
Didn't get past not being able to use it in portrait mode.  I think I should be able to choose whether I need widespread view as in a spreadsheet or a portrait view to view a page of writing and this does not give me the option. I may end up using it this is only the second app that I have tried for organizing by used to be hand & ink written notebooks.;0
I tried to explore it a little after downloading, I want something that will show me everything planned on the day I have notes on rather than me having to search if I do, i tend to forget due to busy schedules. I want automatic pop up, I'll keep playing with it, but so far dislike;0
The app is great for the schedule but the tasks needs work . I should be able to schedule something to repeat every day but it doesn't allow for that option. And it doesn't always register the repeats. Had to pay for the yearly subscription to find out it doesnt even work. Stick with the free version. Least youre not wasting your money. Will have to try something else for my tasks. And the developer doesn't care.;0
Well, based on the description of this app and what I understood I would receive has not, lived up to its description. I hope the bugs will be worked out. I emailed for help more than 24 hours ago and have not received any response thus far.  It would be helpful to have a help and/or FAQ section to refer to. After only one day of using the app, I have encountered the following:  1. From calendar screen, + button does not give option for Project (only Event, Task, or Note).  I have the upgraded version.  2. Settings, General, Start with... is set for Day View, but shows month instead.  3. Help & Feedback only gives option to email for help. No option to search for help.  4. When deleting an item in a series comma I do not get the option to just delete the one occurrence.  Am I doing something wrong? Is there any help that I can expect to receive? I paid $4.99 for the upgraded version, and I am not at all happy. Busy people with crazy schedules need a reliable app.;0
App is very buggy ! Week view is completely unusable - shows some events twice, and some not at all.  Also, it would be nice if there was an option, in month view, to see the names of the events without having to click on every day individually.  Fix this and you'll get 5 stars, but without that (especially week view!) the app is useless.;0
I do not use it so I want to cancel the subscription but am unable. Jorte had unsubscribe within opening page. Unable to sign in.;0
I don't want make an account before trying out the app! Give us a week trial before making us sign up, please.;0
With so many free calendar apps out there, there's just nothing in the free version of this one to make you choose it. The only feature that might set it apart from the competition is the project feature, but you have to pay to use it. Sure, you have the notes feature, but there are ways to accomplish the same thing in pretty much any other calendar, so I just can't see the point. Rather than pay for an upgrade to an app that's just ho-hum (the view isn't even very customizable), I'll be uninstalling.;0
It doesn't work well as a calander or any type of memo for me. I also didn't like the type of layout design they made it didn't fit with what the purpose of this app was said to do;0
I have questions that i would like to have answered and i have emailed numerous times with no reponse back. They say dont write negative reponses to this app without contacting us first. I did email for answers but no one will answer my questions. My questions are not bad for this app but the people behind this app are terrible business people. So this could be a great app but service is terrible. Which instead of getting 4 or 5 stars im giving 2 should be 1 but app is good the ones behind the app are bad just want to take peoples money and then laugh at us by not helping;0
The app worked fine for awhile but all the events I added were simply gone this morning. This was a frustrating experience.;0
i cant set my times for events bc theres no am/pm option. it keeps changing my time not allowing me to put the right thing..annoying;0
Doesn't sync reliably, and that's one of the most critical features for a calendar app.;0
Used to love this app, but after the update it's dumb and no longer useful.;0
This app is a pretty good one, but on my Galaxy Note, it stopped allowing me to check off tasks for some reason.  I paid for the pro version before this happened unfortunately.;0
I like the app, but for the past day I haven't got any notifications.;0
This app is not good if you don't buy the subscription.;0
When my phone is in tablet mode (android 7) the app will not display in portrait mode. It defaults to landscape mode.  Pls fix and I'll change my review.;0
Isn't Thanksgiving and Christmas considered a holiday??? Am I wrong???;0
I just installed this app and it's always on landscape view. Please fix this soon. Thank you!;0
Ads. Just too many.;0
The app does not sync with my Google calendar and there is no sync option or refresh option. Meetings etc are not shown and I have to go back to the Google calendar or acalender to make sure I don't miss anything. Events made on my tablet do not show on my phone. Please fix this. It's such a great app if it just worked.;0
Unable to create an account despite using email or social media account. Can't even start trying out the app;0
It would be a 5* review if it weren't yearly payment. Put it a one time payment and I'll be the first one to buy it. This really ruined it for me.;0
Its still asking me in an ad on the app to upgrade.  Not cool!;0
Wish I can repeat sirten things without spending  money every year;0
You want me to pay $5 for the full version so I can set a task to repeat? My phone's planner does that for free.;0
This thing is terrible I couldn't do anything I wanted;0
ট্যাবে হরাইজন্টাল, ফোনে ভার্টিকাল। ফলে ট্যাবে লিখতে অসুবিধা হচ্ছে। এবং লগ ইন করতে হয় যেকোন অ্যাকাউন্টে।;0
Task notifications have stopped working.;0
If you want to start a project you have to pay 4.99 a year.;0
Used to be good until last update, now I can't login to see any of my tasks, appointments, or notes.                                            Edit: Now works since newest update, but I have lost all previous tasks and notes. Very disappointed.;0
Doesn't sync with Google calendar. The one thing it's supposed to do and it failed.;0
This app was everything I needed, I loved it. But after thenlast update I cannot log in to my account so I cannot see my daily schedule. Will not trust it again and I have already unistalled it. I need an organizing app which I can trust. Fortunately all the events were synced to my google calendar but notes and tasks didnt.. So I dont know if I am forgeting something that is pending now.;0
Have used app for about 4 months now I can't get back into it. Keeps asking to sign in or create account won't let me do either. Time to dump it!;0
I logged in with Facebook. I upgraded to the pro version. Checked the planner a day later and had to log in again. Now it says to upgrade to the pro version again and if I click it, Play says I'm already subscribed to it.;0
What happened to all those data i had.. not able to log also;0
At first I really liked it because all the systems are functioning well in my phone.. but when I used this in the tab... the notifications wont even turn !! I  sm really pissed by this and I hope you fix this ASAP;0
I put an event in and it doubles everyday. Fix the glitches this is a great app otherwise.;0
Was a great app...but could not login..since last month so...bye bye planner pro;0
I really did not like the fact that when I set an exact time for stuff, I can not sort to according to that, so If i want to plan my day, 10 am i have to do a, 11 am i have to do b, i can not sort it by time;0
"The free version comes with ads, and normally I would be okay with that except that it decides to interrupt you seemingly every minute to ""buy the full version now."" When planning your day, you might have to schedule time to exit out of the constant ad pop-ups.";0
It was great before, but lately it sends notifications whenever it likes. It doesn't notify according to schedule anymore. And now, it doesn't notify at all.;0
Keeps telling me my email is invalid when it's a normal Gmail.. Won't let me sign up;0
I went on thinking it was easy to put in reminders and stuff but it isn't.You have to buy the full version;0
Doesn't go to portrait;0
Would not load;0
Paid for the pro version and itbdoesn't seem to be working properly.  Appointments are not showing and sometimes double books. Contacted support. Took several days to get back to me and was still not helpful. App is glitchy. Will not be renewing the subscription and going back to the old pencil and paper appointment tracking method.  I cannot run my business with a faulty appointment app. Very disappointing.;0
Norton Antivirus reported this as a malicious App, and recommended I uninstall. After paying for the pro version I felt it was very lacking. No portrait mode on tablet, no day mode on phone, no way to adjust the length of a meeting beyond that of the default meeting settings.;0
I was pretty pleased with the layout and the weekly view on the paid version, but then I started encountering problems. First of all, I used fb to sign up and I logged out of the app, and I can no longer sign in. It stays loading indefinitely. Also, on the weekly view it showed the incorrect name for the day and kept changing it. It also changed notifications randomly.;0
Has potential but you gotta pay;0
The single FranklinCovey planner feature available is the Task ABC123 priorities system, but oddly the Task status system is missing. No more FC system functionality. As of the rest it's a very conventional PIM suite with a little of CRM salt & pepper.;0
The UI is not attractive, to begin with. Text overlap and the fact that the only screen orientation available is landscape immediately turned me off to the app. The layout is not bad and puts all the information right in front of you but it looks as if it was built for Windows 98. I certainly was not willing to pay for the full version when the free version was so flawed. I can find better free apps with more functionality than the paid version of this one. It needs some work.;0
I already had bought the full version and now I have to pay again which is whatever. But furthermore my calendar is missing most of the appointments and recurring events that I had before. I just upgraded my phone to the htc10 from the lg g5 and I have none of my important calendar events now.;0
This app worked well at first, but it kept altering my entries no matter how many times I changed them. Not sure if it's a problem just with syncing accounts.;0
They are always changing Something after updates. And it isn't always functional like used to be;0
The widget stops working way to much.;0
It makes auto-copies of tasks. When you delete them, keep showing them again and again. Very annoying.;0

I can't edit the original repeating ones, I can only delete them individually on the day they show up several times. This is VERY annoying. This app was a waste of my money. I paid for the ability to make repeating tasks. I'm very disappointed.;0
Was fine until the last couple of days when the layout turned squirrelly on my Android tablet.  Seems okay on my smart phone.  Still, I will not purchase full version unless the version for my tablet goes back to matching the screen layout on my cell.;0
Uninstalled when I saw the app wanted me to pay a subscription fee as ransom for my data, I never will.;0
I set weekly view in settings and for few days the app worked fine but today i tried to go back to months view and i tried to access settings but when i try to do that the app closes;0
I just installed this app and it's always on landscape view. Please fix this soon. Thank you!;0
It's just a skin for Google calendar.;0
When my phone is in tablet mode (android 7) the app will not display in portrait mode. It defaults to landscape mode.  Pls fix and I'll change my review.;0
It's ok. The free version does the same thing your calender does on  your phone.;0
With so many free calendar apps out there, there's just nothing in the free version of this one to make you choose it. The only feature that might set it apart from the competition is the project feature, but you have to pay to use it. Sure, you have the notes feature, but there are ways to accomplish the same thing in pretty much any other calendar, so I just can't see the point. Rather than pay for an upgrade to an app that's just ho-hum (the view isn't even very customizable), I'll be uninstalling.;0
I don't want make an account before trying out the app! Give us a week trial before making us sign up, please.;0
Would like questions answered I email my questions for answers & I give my contact info for almost two months now but no one contacts me. This is very disappointing especially when I bought this app. Very poor for business kevin;0
The app is great for the schedule but the tasks needs work . I should be able to schedule something to repeat every day but it doesn't allow for that option. And it doesn't always register the repeats. Had to pay for the yearly subscription to find out it doesnt even work. Stick with the free version. Least youre not wasting your money. Will have to try something else for my tasks. And the developer doesn't care.;0
I have questions that i would like to have answered and i have emailed numerous times with no reponse back. They say dont write negative reponses to this app without contacting us first. I did email for answers but no one will answer my questions. My questions are not bad for this app but the people behind this app are terrible business people. So this could be a great app but service is terrible. Which instead of getting 4 or 5 stars im giving 2 should be 1 but app is good the ones behind the app are bad just want to take peoples money and then laugh at us by not helping;0
Didn't get past not being able to use it in portrait mode.  I think I should be able to choose whether I need widespread view as in a spreadsheet or a portrait view to view a page of writing and this does not give me the option. I may end up using it this is only the second app that I have tried for organizing by used to be hand & ink written notebooks.;0
Ads. Just too many.;0
I really wanted to like this app, but it's just too buggy. Sometimes I open the app and it doesn't have the icons to switch views. Also the 12-hour formatting is really flawed. And the priority scale seems way too complex. High, medium, low should be enough for most people.;0
This app is a pretty good one, but on my Galaxy Note, it stopped allowing me to check off tasks for some reason.  I paid for the pro version before this happened unfortunately.;0
i ws kinda disappointed because i really loved the user interface of the app and how smooth it flows from one set up to another. however, i have to uninstall and install it back up several time because it will not accept the 4digit password i have set it up with. i had to do it like 10 times :/ but still like the app tho. i hope that bug will be fixed sooner.;0
UI atrocious! Nothing fits.;0
App is very buggy ! Week view is completely unusable - shows some events twice, and some not at all.  Also, it would be nice if there was an option, in month view, to see the names of the events without having to click on every day individually.  Fix this and you'll get 5 stars, but without that (especially week view!) the app is useless.;0
Isn't Thanksgiving and Christmas considered a holiday??? Am I wrong???;0
"Widget is buggy - a task marked as completed in the app is displayed as overdue, and trying to tick it off in the widget takes me into edit mode. The proper app, when reopened, shows a blank inbox and revisiting the screen is required to populate it again. Poor punctuation (eg. ""28 Sep , 2017” - why the space before the comma) is not that big a deal, but also adds to the app not feeling very ""pro"".";0
I like the app, but for the past day I haven't got any notifications.;0
This app is not good if you don't buy the subscription.;0
The app worked fine for awhile but all the events I added were simply gone this morning. This was a frustrating experience.;0
I got locked out of my planner. After entering my paascode the app said that the passcode was wrong. It was not wrong. I suspected a system glitch and contacted the developer on June 17th of this year. I haven't received any response yet. I found my way around this problem by this time. I will not renew my subscription anymore. I will look for another app developer with a better customer service.;0
Why this  require this much personal details?;0
i cant set my times for events bc theres no am/pm option. it keeps changing my time not allowing me to put the right thing..annoying;0
I paid for the pro version because the color coding in the free version didn't work properly. Come to find out that the pro version doesn't have daily tabs for tasks and notes as the free version does. But the paid version does color code. Gaining that feature isn't worth losing the other two. I feel robbed.;0
It wouldn't let me in;0
Doesn't sync reliably, and that's one of the most critical features for a calendar app.;0
It was decent at first, but it stops working completely when I wanted to put a custom time reminder, and it did not sync with my Google calendar. I ended up deleting it :/;0
This app is not free for even a trial, so how am I going to buy it.;0
I do not use it so I want to cancel the subscription but am unable. Jorte had unsubscribe within opening page. Unable to sign in.;0
Passcode feature is messed up and locked me out. Had to uninstall. Yr;0
I tried to explore it a little after downloading, I want something that will show me everything planned on the day I have notes on rather than me having to search if I do, i tend to forget due to busy schedules. I want automatic pop up, I'll keep playing with it, but so far dislike;0
The single FranklinCovey planner feature available is the Task ABC123 priorities system, but oddly the Task status system is missing. No more FC system functionality. As of the rest it's a very conventional PIM suite with a little of CRM salt & pepper.;0
Well, based on the description of this app and what I understood I would receive has not, lived up to its description. I hope the bugs will be worked out. I emailed for help more than 24 hours ago and have not received any response thus far.  It would be helpful to have a help and/or FAQ section to refer to. After only one day of using the app, I have encountered the following:  1. From calendar screen, + button does not give option for Project (only Event, Task, or Note).  I have the upgraded version.  2. Settings, General, Start with... is set for Day View, but shows month instead.  3. Help & Feedback only gives option to email for help. No option to search for help.  4. When deleting an item in a series comma I do not get the option to just delete the one occurrence.  Am I doing something wrong? Is there any help that I can expect to receive? I paid $4.99 for the upgraded version, and I am not at all happy. Busy people with crazy schedules need a reliable app.;0
It doesn't work well as a calander or any type of memo for me. I also didn't like the type of layout design they made it didn't fit with what the purpose of this app was said to do;0
Used to love this app, but after the update it's dumb and no longer useful.;0
The app does not sync with my Google calendar and there is no sync option or refresh option. Meetings etc are not shown and I have to go back to the Google calendar or acalender to make sure I don't miss anything. Events made on my tablet do not show on my phone. Please fix this. It's such a great app if it just worked.;0
It would be a 5* review if it weren't yearly payment. Put it a one time payment and I'll be the first one to buy it. This really ruined it for me.;0
Free app is crippled version of paid app costs $4.99 a year.;0
If you want to start a project you have to pay 4.99 a year.;0
I try signing up, logging in, even with Facebook and still won't even let me in;0
Unable to create an account despite using email or social media account. Can't even start trying out the app;0
This thing is terrible I couldn't do anything I wanted;0
You want me to pay $5 for the full version so I can set a task to repeat? My phone's planner does that for free.;0
It has deleted all of my entries planned for today. I am going to try a new app.;0
Task notifications have stopped working.;0
Its still asking me in an ad on the app to upgrade.  Not cool!;0
ট্যাবে হরাইজন্টাল, ফোনে ভার্টিকাল। ফলে ট্যাবে লিখতে অসুবিধা হচ্ছে। এবং লগ ইন করতে হয় যেকোন অ্যাকাউন্টে।;0
Wish I can repeat sirten things without spending  money every year;0
I installed because of the option to synch tasks, but that is one of the features that unlocks for $4.99/yr. No issues paying it if I liked the feature, but with no chance to try out the one reason I download the app, I uninstalled immediately.;0
Very easy to pull me in I should have stopped, but hindsight is always 20/20. My friends and people who are interested in Google Apps for integrated coordination of tasks, meetings, whatever, but what really gets my blood boiling and made me downgraded from 3 stars to 2 Stars is the deadweight loss of not being able to either donate the rest of the subscription Source Capital investment that is just raining still if someone makes to make a donation. Is that I'm still sitting here with this deadweight loss.;0
Its okay;0
Doesn't sync with Google calendar. The one thing it's supposed to do and it failed.;0
Used to be good until last update, now I can't login to see any of my tasks, appointments, or notes.                                            Edit: Now works since newest update, but I have lost all previous tasks and notes. Very disappointed.;0
Need full version for anything more than a calender;0
What happened to all those data i had.. not able to log also;0
Have used app for about 4 months now I can't get back into it. Keeps asking to sign in or create account won't let me do either. Time to dump it!;0
The ease of use for everyday things is great, I have a note pad, task pad and calendar and I just set a task to call back a customer after hrs.. Sure it might note be a flashy business planner but if you just want something to remind you of events store something quickly for later reference, what more do you need, so far any ads haven't been intrusive the main reason people stop using these kind of apps;1
If you're familiar with Stephen Covey's product suite, you'll find this tool to be an essential time management companion. The interface is similar to the paper based system. The application provides fields for tasks, events, etc. There are supporting priority and notification features aiding in the arrangement and alerting of tasks. The application would benefit from improvements with the synchronization of tasks across multiple devices.;1
I like the app. I use the weekly planner widget thw most so it is easier to get organized. It syncs with Google calendar. The only reason I am not giving it a 5 stars is becauae after an update it stopped updating the week on my screen and I have to search for the right week everytime.;1
Good app to use. I've been bullet journaling by hand but moving back to digital and this was the best I found to transition. Early days but so far so good;1
This is a decent app for keeping track events and appointments.;1
Good Interface but recent tech issues. App slow to open.;1
Just using basic to track milage. Works fine.;1
I have been using this app for years. What l especially like is the simplicity of use..;1
Easy to use app. Allows me to keep track of my busy schedule.;1
Would be nice to have the ability to add more tabs......;1
I love that the app interface is so easy to use. The reason I don't give it 5 stars is because you can't export notes. It would be ideal if that could be done.;1
Easy to navigate;1
I'm using 2 calenders and 1 To Do planner not including this. All has their pros and functions I want, yet they're different in style. This is one of the best. I just love using the week view seeing at one shot, time of events laid out in planner, including notes on that day with pics uploaded if needed. It sync with my AnyDo planner which has a calender. But I just love how I can use this a bit differently for scheduling. Best if only it has a daily mood tracker added in the notes function.;1
I had a problem with upgrading to Premium. They were quick with their response and fixed the problem right away. It's a good app for those familiar with the Franklin Covey system, and syncs well across devices.;1
Great app. I would rate it a 5 but there's an error where my completed tasks becomes unchecked constantly causing it to keep on becoming an unfinished task and it's annoying.;1
I do like the straight forwardness of this system it does what it says on the tin, needs to keep developing but in the theme it's in if it gets to clever like some systems it will loss it's position;1
Great app and the only flaw I see is that you can't yet export your data. Please make it so you can export data to something like pdf or something so I can save my entries forever;1
I love this app! I have the pro version and the layout is very clean and organized. However, only 4 stars because it does not work on multiple devices.;1
so far the best planner app i ever come across. room for improvement i.e. to be accessible on PC as if some other app does.;1
It is what I have looked for for some time. I wish it could sync'd across multiple devices.;1
I wish I could create notes without having to select a date. Otherwise so far so nice 🤓;1
Very easy to use. Have all I need;1
Better to have a search option for notes;1
Very good reminder;1
Good Planner Apps;1
I would subscribe in the app if it supports right-to-left languages such as arabic. When I switch my mobile to arabic the text in the widgets mix up with buttons.;1
"Doesn't replace my default calendar but does have extra features that take it from ""calendar/scheduler"" to ""planner"". Great product.";1
Any chance of getting a widget for the calendar????? Love the dark mode!;1
GOOD HELP;1
Nice;1
This is the only app that does what it does and I love the functionality. The only problem is the app is quite buggy and I haven't seen or noticed any updates in years. Would also be nice if there was a website to go with it. I am finally giving up and moving to day by day which leverages google calendar and google tasks. If google would just incorporate tasks into its calendar better, that would do it all.;1
Good;1
After purchasing the Pro Version and having used this calendar app for almost 2 to 3 years now, I have grown to truly love it. It mimicks as close to the Franklin Covey Planner's to any app out there I have found and this is what has drawn me to it. I am increasing my rating to 4 stars, because I have really had time to utilize all aspects of this calendar and I love that it will sink with my Google calendar and other calendars. I love this app, I only wish it could print.;1
osm osm osm osm;1
great app;1
Events sometimes take a while to show up on the day you selected for them, other times a certain day will not be selectable. choosing midnight as an ending time for an event doesn't seem to work.;1
Just installed and am liking it so far. I do wish there was a way to disable the quotes and better utilize that space to see more of my actual calendar. Also sub tasks would be very useful. With those changes I might actually be able to downsize the apps I use.;1
Haven't found how to sync between two devices yet!;1
I just need notification  tone more than these and much more long;1
Good job;1
I really like this app - its a lovely interface, simple to use and very useful to have both tasks and notes with the calendar. Is there any possibility of adding a folder/tag/category function to the notes?  It would be so helpful - I make notes on a varietu of things as I go along, and its really useful to be able to store them by day, but it would also be great to be able to sort them by tags or folders. Anyway - just a suggestion. Otherwise a lovely app. Thanks :-);1
A great app. I just downloaded it and I already love it. The only issue here is slight ui bugs. November 2017 gets covered up by the tabs at the top and on the day section the date runs into the calender layout. Again great app but those errors make the app look less professional. I would recommend rescaling the fragments so they fit better on the page as well as the toolbar. Definitely am recommending to friends though;1
Almost perfect. The only changes that would be helpful is a quicker way to switch from the week view to the task list. And i would like to see my tasks as a list by default instead of clicking on the task categories. Also I wish that you had a rollover option for tasks, I have yet to find an app that had this: basically I wish when I create a task I could choose if the task carries forward to the next day if not completed or not.;1
I really like this app and ised to love it until there was an update that was stopping me from using it without upgrading. If i had to pay a one time purchase thats one thing but an annual fee?? Give me a break. $5 for a planner app is reasonable if you use it all of the time but not every year. Yall are greedy.;1
The essence and notion of this application is not just to define activities from day to day basis but to remind us that its really not about perfection... Its about progress... This application teaches us not just to address holistically in our commitment and time management but also push drastically at the same time our attitude towards commitments.. Senior Project Engineer here... It really helps alot... Thank you.;1
I just downloaded this.  The free version was definitely useful but I went ahead and got the paid version because I wanted to use the repetitive tasks and weekly planner as well.  I definitely think this will be worth the purchase.;1
Great App, but would be good if you could edit tasks after you've written them.  Also would be good if it could have, a daily 'things to do list'on.calendar ,which could be ticked off alongside projects /tasks.;1
This app is great! But i have some suggestions that would even better improve the quality of using the app. for example, something like being able to edit the tasks widgets to show 'due soon' instead of just tasks for that day for even better planning.;1
Great app!    Help,  I unfortunately forgot my password (I was very sure it's correct but I'm not sure why it says it's wrong). Is there anything that can be done about it?;1
Things were going great until I switched to a new phone .I can't find out how to sync my tasks and events to the new phone. I installed the app in my new phone and logged in, but the data is not there . I see that the events comes from the Google calendar, and I may be able to do something about that - but how do I sync the tasks ? Pls help.;1
Awesome app! It helps me a lot to organize my life, work and other stuffs. The features are really amazing! Would recommend this to my friends and colleagues.;1
I went a got the full subscription and I really like it so far, but I wish you could download it for your PC as well.;1
This app is great but maybe let us tick task we completed from widget as it's annoying the app will opened up when I pressed the box to tick what I've completed everytime;1
I really like this app for the most part, but I really don't like how the month view in-app and on the widget don't actually list out what you have on that day, just colored dots. Would really like to be able to have this since I paid for the Pro version, please consider!;1
I think that feature of changing theme should be addef and apart from that there should also be a option for showing task on thr facr of calender itselg;1
I would like to be able to import my contacts to it. I would give 5 stars for that;1
Great user interface. Easy to use. Syncing with Google calendar is a huge advantage. From To-do lists to events you can schedule anything.;1
I love this app.  I have always been a Franklin Covey planner gal and this is similar to the paper planner.  Great search function.;1
The perfect planner..Only thing missing is that Remimder is not working..;1
Add alarms to notification in events or tasks and allow to add ringtone on it. Love it;1
Nice apps. But need to re download the full version.;1
Ok;1
Good enaught;1
Great Tool;1
Greatly improved comment from me.  MUCH better than a year ago.  Most updated lead to improvement.  Wish the ' want an annual subscription.;1
It's 👍;1
Almost all the functionality of the Franklin Planner. This is a great app!;1
This is the app which I use for almost a year. There is one issue I have faced recently. Namely, some tasks and events do not synchronize on multiple devices where I installed the app. I'm using this app on my Android smartphone, as well as on iPad. I would be very pleased if you fix it.;1
Nice app. But can update a function such as we can add in an attachment(like photo) into the task or etc will be better;1
Works great most of the time however crashes when making my display size small. Google pixel. Recurring error.;1
Would have given it 5 stars, but it doesn't seem to want to rotate when using my tablet.;1
I like this app. It has a lot of the features I use all in one place. However, even though it lists all my Google calendars, I can't figure out how to do anything with them. I have projects spread over a dozen calendars but I can't seem to add anything to any of them.;1
Awesome app. Wish had auto sort feature of priority task like Franklin planner use to have.;1
This is a simple app, that gives me the capability of creating a to-do list, set event on my calendar and take notes...;1
The calendar reminders can be very shotty but the overall app is very useful;1
It's a really great app;1
Cool;1
Very Helpful, The Best Yet !;1
I like the app, very helpful for lots of things, however I've lost my account twice. I've had to uninstall it and recreate my account. Very good otherwise tho;1
I loved this app. Worked so great I purchased it. Now it has logged me out and says I don't exist.;1
I don't know. It works good and I like that you can add notes to the task that is very helpful. I just kind of would like to have a better weekly view. But all in all it gets the job done.;1
I love this app and has been using it for more than a year, but lately it has bugs which changes the days when i opened it per-days. Please fix it;1
Like it a little even bought the pro version. But when I went to the website trying to find out how do you back up your data in the event something happens to your phone.;1
I just installed this gem of an app this morning, and love its ease of use. However, there is a minor problem...the date in big numbers on the left is one day behind the monthly calendar.;1
Great app and easy to use. Would be great if there was a no date option on notes for like shopping lists ect. That aren't just for the day.;1
It's generally good, but screen rotation doesn't work. so, I can't use this app upside down in Galaxy Tab10. If this problem isn't solved, I won't pay for the next year. It would be great if this problem is solved!;1
Good for studying;1
it is helpful.;1
Haven't been using this app for long but it seems great so far. I LOVE that incompleted tasks roll over to the current day. I just wish you could attach attach photos or files to your notes. That would make this a 5-star review.;1
A today button would be helpful in the week view widget, so that you don't have to scroll back. And also the possibility to add more accounts. Are these features available in the pro version? Maybe the possibility to try it  for a short period of time...;1
I am the most unorganized person ever, and this app has helped me a lot. I constantly put down when my projects, tests, etc are due. I even include my days off on it. I also love that you can not down little notes with this app as well.;1
It was very useful for me to plan my days until the latest update which the widget shows the wrong day and I am unable switch the day..;1
Why on earth when I'm on one day and create a task it schedules it for the day before that by default? just why?;1
This is a great planner app. Only thing missing is the ability to rotate into portrait or even rotate 180 degrees.;1
This is a decent app for keeping track events and appointments.;1

I like this app. It has a lot of the features I use all in one place. However, even though it lists all my Google calendars, I can't figure out how to do anything with them. I have projects spread over a dozen calendars but I can't seem to add anything to any of them.;1
ItS pretty good.;1
Nice apps. But need to re download the full version.;1
Great App, but would be good if you could edit tasks after you've written them.  Also would be good if it could have, a daily 'things to do list'on.calendar ,which could be ticked off alongside projects /tasks.;1
Overall a good app but I would also like the option of switching from landscape view.;1
Add alarms to notification in events or tasks and allow to add ringtone on it. Love it;1
Great Very usefull, please add fitur search to find an old note;1
A great app. I just downloaded it and I already love it. The only issue here is slight ui bugs. November 2017 gets covered up by the tabs at the top and on the day section the date runs into the calender layout. Again great app but those errors make the app look less professional. I would recommend rescaling the fragments so they fit better on the page as well as the toolbar. Definitely am recommending to friends though;1
Good enaught;1
Ok;1
The perfect planner..Only thing missing is that Remimder is not working..;1
This app is great but maybe let us tick task we completed from widget as it's annoying the app will opened up when I pressed the box to tick what I've completed everytime;1
I think that feature of changing theme should be addef and apart from that there should also be a option for showing task on thr facr of calender itselg;1
I would like to be able to import my contacts to it. I would give 5 stars for that;1
The essence and notion of this application is not just to define activities from day to day basis but to remind us that its really not about perfection... Its about progress... This application teaches us not just to address holistically in our commitment and time management but also push drastically at the same time our attitude towards commitments.. Senior Project Engineer here... It really helps alot... Thank you.;1
I really like this app - its a lovely interface, simple to use and very useful to have both tasks and notes with the calendar. Is there any possibility of adding a folder/tag/category function to the notes?  It would be so helpful - I make notes on a varietu of things as I go along, and its really useful to be able to store them by day, but it would also be great to be able to sort them by tags or folders. Anyway - just a suggestion. Otherwise a lovely app. Thanks :-);1
Awesome app! It helps me a lot to organize my life, work and other stuffs. The features are really amazing! Would recommend this to my friends and colleagues.;1
Almost perfect. The only changes that would be helpful is a quicker way to switch from the week view to the task list. And i would like to see my tasks as a list by default instead of clicking on the task categories. Also I wish that you had a rollover option for tasks, I have yet to find an app that had this: basically I wish when I create a task I could choose if the task carries forward to the next day if not completed or not.;1
I like it;1
I went a got the full subscription and I really like it so far, but I wish you could download it for your PC as well.;1
It's cool;1
I just downloaded this.  The free version was definitely useful but I went ahead and got the paid version because I wanted to use the repetitive tasks and weekly planner as well.  I definitely think this will be worth the purchase.;1
I really like this app and ised to love it until there was an update that was stopping me from using it without upgrading. If i had to pay a one time purchase thats one thing but an annual fee?? Give me a break. $5 for a planner app is reasonable if you use it all of the time but not every year. Yall are greedy.;1
This app is great! But i have some suggestions that would even better improve the quality of using the app. for example, something like being able to edit the tasks widgets to show 'due soon' instead of just tasks for that day for even better planning.;1
Great app!    Help,  I unfortunately forgot my password (I was very sure it's correct but I'm not sure why it says it's wrong). Is there anything that can be done about it?;1
This is a great planner app. Only thing missing is the ability to rotate into portrait or even rotate 180 degrees.;1
The app was working fine until I removed Google Now. Now the widgets will not show on home page.;1
planned not bad;1
This is the app which I use for almost a year. There is one issue I have faced recently. Namely, some tasks and events do not synchronize on multiple devices where I installed the app. I'm using this app on my Android smartphone, as well as on iPad. I would be very pleased if you fix it.;1
Greatly improved comment from me.  MUCH better than a year ago.  Most updated lead to improvement.  Wish the ' want an annual subscription.;1
It's 👍;1
Almost all the functionality of the Franklin Planner. This is a great app!;1
The calendar reminders can be very shotty but the overall app is very useful;1
This is a simple app, that gives me the capability of creating a to-do list, set event on my calendar and take notes...;1
It's a really great app;1
If only the calender icons cld stop piling up on the phobe task bar everytime one is due. So if I created 5 events to go off in an hr I'll have 5 icons piled up on my fone. It's not needed. Or at least put an option so people cld disable it if they don't want it.;1
Cool;1
This planner pro is very nice and better for you time schedule;1
Awesome app. Wish had auto sort feature of priority task like Franklin planner use to have.;1
Works great most of the time however crashes when making my display size small. Google pixel. Recurring error.;1
Nice app. But can update a function such as we can add in an attachment(like photo) into the task or etc will be better;1
Would have given it 5 stars, but it doesn't seem to want to rotate when using my tablet.;1
Very Helpful, The Best Yet !;1
I like the app, very helpful for lots of things, however I've lost my account twice. I've had to uninstall it and recreate my account. Very good otherwise tho;1
I loved this app. Worked so great I purchased it. Now it has logged me out and says I don't exist.;1
This is by far the best Day Planner App I have found, and I have tried most of them! Having your Tasks and Calendar all together in the one place really suits the way I like to work. It also means you are less likely to miss something because you didn't check you Task App or Calendar that day. Sure there are a couple if things I'd like to see added, but you can say that about almost any App!;1
Love it. As a Franklin planner user since '84, this is the closest app that I have found to that format. Only wish I would have is for a windows version that I could use on my office desktop that would sync across to my android phone and tablet.;1
So good. I won't worry at all. And I can catch up at things without missing anything. I got my routine right either. And I cannot forget and miss things too often. Good. It's so good....;1
Love it!! Love that it keeps what I did that day forever and crosses it out!! Just like on a piece of paper and you can have a note section!!!;1
I use this planner on a daily basis. It keeps me straight! Love it!!!;1
I used a Franklin Planner, this is a great alternative to going the digital route. This is used daily for me in taking notes troughout the day and setting up tasks that need completed.;1
Simple and easy to use app to schedule daily, weekly, and monthly tasks.;1
I love this planner app because I can see all my events/appointments, tasks & notes at a glance. The best planner app I've found. Simple design....easy to use!;1
Excellent app! I run my own business and this helps me keep all of my appointments and events organized so I don't forget anything.;1
For many years I used the franklin covey system and enjoyed it but I'm enjoying the planner pro giving me the same thing but at my fingertips and convenience to carry.;1
Love Planner Pro to keep up with tasks and appointments. Optional alarms for meetings and events are very helpful to keep me on track.;1
This app helps me compartmentalize my hectic life. Thank you for such a great app, its a life changer.;1
I love being able to color code appointments and to list tasks separately. Reminder pop ups are wonderful, also.;1
Love this app. Posts on my home screen ( with a widget) so I see my appointments at all times. Easy to use..;1
Love it, easy to use and great for reminders. Best part of it is that you can link it to your Google calendar.;1
Love this app. Very user friendly and easy to link schedule with other devices.;1
I've been using planner pro for at least 2 years. Has not disappointed!;1

Very easy to use. I have not experienced any problems with this app.;1
Very useful in my day to day activity. Able to share different calander events with others and view theirs as well.;1
Been using this app for for years now and I really love it and help me organize stuff/schedules.;1
Definitely the best planner as I have been a user for the past 3 yrs.;1
I've been using for 3-4 years....look at other things for a day or 2 and I always come back to this;1
Very helpful to keep tract activities daily, monthy and annualy.;1
I'm crazy about organizing and lists I absolutely love this app!;1

Works well and don't bother you;1
You win, take my money. I have been using this app for many years and never bought the upgrade. I recently upgraded to the S10, and between Bixby, Google, and many planning apps, I just couldn't separate myself from this one. I simply have not found an app that's easier to add and complete tasks. Also the task widget is just hands down better than every other one out there. So fine, if you want to add fullscreen ads (and have the audacity to include sound) then take my money you can have it.;1
very useful. its where I note my accomplishments for the day as well as my planned tasks/events.. thanks to the developer of this app..;1
Very handy tool;1
I have never seen a more beautifully designed calendar+planner app. Easy on eyes, strikes a great balance between functionality and simplicity (Google and Microsoft calendar apps should take inspiration from this) and ... just great. When I start earning I'm definitely going to buy this app just to show gratitude :);1
This is the best planing app I could find on the play store. It syncs with my Google calendar enabling it to be an all inclusive planner, but also has lots of personal orginazational abilities. I am very impressed with this planner and would recommend it to anyone who likes to be very well planned.;1
Amazing work done for this app. I have looked for a long time for an app which was fast, well developed and really easy to use. Keep this way always!;1
Great support, ads were displayed, dev had it fixed in a day. Thank you, and great product. it's the closest thing to a Franklin Planner I have found.;1
Best planner out there! I love the ability to take notes, journal, track projects, schedule events and to-dos all in one place. Excellent!!!;1
Amazing app, meets requirements, and even excels them. Well done on this app, and notifications, notes and reminders are all taken care if and safely delivered to you on time. ❤;1
Helps me to organize my day when I don't have my physical planner at hand held me to remember important and vidal tasks that help sort out my family and daily routines while allowing to add onto my busy schedules throughout the week also able to sort out the important tasks by colour coordination . Thank you for the opportunity to have a great planner at my 👆 fingertips;1
I really like the planner, it helps me achieve my tasks, goals & have an avenue to scribe my ideas down. Double thumbs up!;1
This is by far the best overall organizer app I have found. My only complaint would be the lack of multi tiered tasks.;1
Would pay for this if there were even more additions and updates. Absolutely love it and wish they would develop it even further;1
Very useful app;1
I've used planner pro for 5 years or more now. Couldn't do without it.;1
